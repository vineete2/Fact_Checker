{"headline": "Romanian\u2019s Tale Has Art World Fearing the Worst", "body": "\nPARIS \u2014 To Olga Dogaru, a lifelong resident of the tiny Romanian village of Carcaliu, the strangely beautiful artworks her son had brought home in a suitcase four months earlier had become a curse.         \n\nNo matter, she said, that the works \u2014 seven in all \u2014 were signed by Picasso, Matisse, Monet, Gauguin, Lucian Freud and Meyer de Haan. Her son had just been arrested on suspicion of orchestrating the art robbery of the century: stealing masterpieces in  \n from the  \n museum in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.         \n\nBut if the paintings and drawings no longer existed, Radu Dogaru, her son, could be free from prosecution, she reasoned. So Mrs. Dogaru told the police that on a freezing night in February, she placed all seven works \u2014 which included Monet\u2019s 1901 \u201cWaterloo Bridge, London\u201d; Gauguin\u2019s 1898 \u201cGirl in Front of Open Window\u201d; and Picasso\u2019s 1971 \u201cHarlequin Head\u201d \u2014 in a wood-burning stove used to heat saunas and incinerated them.         \n\nMrs. Dogaru\u2019s confession could be pure invention, and the works could be discovered hidden away somewhere. But this week, after examining ashes from her oven, forensic scientists at Romania\u2019s National History Museum appeared on the verge of confirming the art world\u2019s worst fears: her tale is true.         \n\nIn total, the works were valued at hundreds of millions of dollars, but for curators and art lovers, their loss would be irreplaceable.         \n\n\u201cUnfortunately, I have a bad feeling that a huge and horrible crime happened, and the masterpieces were destroyed,\u201d Ernest Oberlander-Tarnoveanu, the director of the National History Museum, said in a telephone interview on Thursday. If so, he added, it would be \u201ca barbarian crime against humanity.\u201d         \n\nHow Picassos, Matisses, Monets and other precious masterpieces may have met a fiery fate in a remote Romanian village, population 3,400, is something the police are still trying to understand. The theft has turned into a compelling and convoluted mystery that underscores the intrigues of the international criminal networks lured by high-priced art and the enormous difficulties involved in storing, selling or otherwise disposing of well-known works after they have been stolen.         \n\nAs in so many such mesmerizing capers, including an estimated $350 million worth of  \n recently, the theft itself is often easier than the fencing. It is a quandary, along with the lengths a mother might go to protect her son, that could help explain Mrs. Dogaru\u2019s desperate actions, if she did what she says she did.         \n\nMr. Oberlander-Tarnoveanu declined to say whether it had been established that the ash found in Mrs. Dogaru\u2019s oven, which the police turned over to his investigative team, was in fact the burned remains of the stolen canvases. \u201cThat is for legal authorities to determine,\u201d he said.         \n\nBut he said his team had discovered material that classical French, Dutch, Spanish and other European artists typically used to prepare canvases for oil painting, as well as the \u201cremains of colors, like red, yellow, green, blue, gray.\u201d The pigments included cinnabar, chromium green and lazurite \u2014 a blue-green copper compound \u2014 as well as tin-lead yellow, which artists stopped using after the 19th century because of toxicity. In addition, copper nails and tacks made by blacksmiths before the Industrial Revolution and used to tack canvas down were found in the debris. Such items would be nearly impossible to fake, he said.         \n\nIt would be harder to verify if two other works that were stolen, by Picasso and Matisse, were burned, Mr. Oberlander-Tarnoveanu said. More delicate than the other five works, the two were done in pastels and colored ink on paper. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s impossible to assess those remains,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause the burned paper was basically turned into pure carbon.\u201d         \n\nThe stolen works were part of a collection amassed by a Dutch investor, Willem Cordia, that had been exhibited for only a week at the Kunsthal. The police say three men, led by Mr. Dogaru, 28, broke in through an emergency exit and snatched the seven works from the wall in just under two minutes. Mr. Dogaru was arrested in late January in Carcaliu.         \n\nThe other stolen works were Monet\u2019s \u201cCharing Cross Bridge, London,\u201d painted in 1901; Matisse\u2019s \u201cReading Girl in White and Yellow\u201d from 1919; and de Haan\u2019s \u201cSelf-Portrait\u201d from 1890; and Freud\u2019s 2002 \u201cWoman With Eyes Closed.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/19/world/europe/romanians-tale-has-art-world-fearing-worst.html", "date": "2013-07-18", "description": "Ashes from the oven of a Romanian woman contain paint and nails, indicating that she may have burned seven works stolen from a Dutch museum.
