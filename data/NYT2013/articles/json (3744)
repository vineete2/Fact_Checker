{"headline": "Putting Up Tomato Preserves", "body": "\nIf I had to choose only one food to preserve, it would be tomatoes. The unquestionable stars of the summer, they need little more than a trusted recipe to go from jar to dinner. Pasta all\u2019arrabbiata, gumbo, chana masala, enchiladas, shakshuka, bouillabaisse: each jar holds a world of possibility.         \n\nIt begins with a beautiful tableau of 8 to 10 pounds of ripe but not overripe tomatoes. But I cannot necessarily promise a beautiful experience. Your kitchen might be small. Or hot. Hand-crushing the fruit inevitably ends with juice on the counter, the floor, the cabinets. Add a vat or two of boiling water and you get the idea.         \n\nBut wait: Rather than focusing on the drudgery, I sometimes plan a party, gathering friends and family with promises of food and drink. Many hands make quick work of the mountain of tomatoes. And knowing there will be tomatoes on the shelf in the dark days of winter? That alone makes the day worthwhile.         \n\nAny tomato will work. I prefer Brandywines and what are often called Rutgers varieties: Reds, Jersey Reds and Ramapos. If they\u2019re available, I\u2019ll opt for paste or Roma tomatoes for their rich flavor and slightly higher yield. I avoid yellow, green or maroon tomatoes because the colors do not translate well to the jar. At some farmers\u2019 markets slightly bruised or otherwise not-quite-perfect tomatoes may be available; these are the veteran\u2019s choice for economy alone.         \n\nAcidity, a crucial element of safe canning, varies widely among tomatoes. Adding lemon juice or citric acid to each jar ensures you will have a low enough pH level to avoid botulism. Bottled lemon juice or the juice from the common Eureka lemon will work; do not substitute other citrus or even Meyer lemons because they do not have the same acidifying power. I use citric acid because it adds less flavor and is less expensive.         \n\nCan your tomatoes with just the acid and perhaps a bit of salt and make your marinara later, after you open the jar, just as you might with canned tomatoes from the store. Avoid the temptation to jazz up the tomatoes with flavors; the addition of peppers, chiles, onions, garlic, mushrooms, meat, carrots, celery or oil all play havoc with the acidity you have taken care to regulate.         \n\nI will heat up the kitchen and make a mess each weekend from now until the tomato vines are killed by frost. The jars I put up will hold the flavors of sunny afternoons when I need them in January.
