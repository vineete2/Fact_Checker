{"headline": "Outsource Your Way to Success", "body": "\nJon Steinsson and Emi Nakamura do not have enough time to do everything they need to do. They\u2019re recently tenured, highly productive rising stars at Columbia University, as well as parents to an infant. But they have a secret weapon helping them prioritize: Econ 101.         \n\nOne of the oldest, if not entirely intuitive, principles in economics is comparative advantage, developed by the British economist David Ricardo in the early 19th century. As introductory econ students all learn, it explains why countries and companies ought to outsource the production of lower-value goods and services, even if they can produce them more efficiently themselves.         \n\nEven if you\u2019re faster and more effective than everyone else at a given task \u2014 fighting with the cable company, say, or folding your socks just so \u2014 you still might be better off if you pay someone else to do it for you. Why? Because there is an opportunity cost for every hour consumed by these tedious, nonproductive tasks; there exists some higher-value activity you could be spending your time on instead.         \n\nSteinsson and Nakamura, both economists, take the tenets of their field seriously. And so they outsource as much of the humdrum aspects of their personal lives as they can.         \n\nLast year, the couple hired a personal chef. She drops off five healthful meals at the beginning of every week to reduce the time they spend cooking (they used to cook recreationally; now they\u2019d rather spend that time with their son). They have also paid people to: build Ikea furniture for them (even though the service often costs more than the furniture itself); teach them how to use software programs and baby carriers; and load their CD collection onto their computers. They even hired someone to spend hours going through thousands of old family photographs to figure out which are the \u201cgood ones.\u201d         \n\nThat last task has proved a bit problematic. It\u2019s hard for a stranger to look at snapshots from your childhood and determine which ones represent truly memorable moments. Still, Steinsson remains confident in the theory. \u201cWe haven\u2019t figured it out yet, but we haven\u2019t given up,\u201d he told me.         \n\nWhile it\u2019s now common, especially in cities like New York, for professionals to hire a housekeeper and pay for some degree of child care, outsourcing other activities is quite rare and even stigmatized among noneconomists. Embracing the D.I.Y. ethos is (wrongly) perceived as evidence of thrift or even moral virtue. A personal chef is the sort of luxury people associate with hedge-funders, Europeans with several surnames and oil sheikhs. Still, you need not be an heiress to benefit from paying for a personal assistant or gofer of some kind. From an economist\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s similar to taking out student loans: an investment in your future earning potential. Yet few outside the field see it that way.         \n\nPart of the problem is that most people don\u2019t understand the value of their time, particularly if they are salaried. Paying someone to buy your groceries or take the car to the mechanic sounds like money down the drain if you\u2019re not billing hourly. But buying yourself an extra hour to work today can be good for your career tomorrow, if doing so improves your chances of getting a promotion or a raise.         \n\nThat\u2019s why Steinsson and Nakamura paid for housekeeping services even when they were penniless grad students. Outsourcing household tasks meant they had to take on more debt, but they calculated \u2014 correctly \u2014 that spending an extra hour working on a paper was better for their lifetime expected earnings than spending that same hour vacuuming.         \n\nThere is also a strong cultural aversion to certain forms of outsourcing. Hiring people to work essentially as servants smacks of classism or insufficient self-reliance. Scrubbing your own toilet or doing your own laundry supposedly builds character, or something to that effect. And while it\u2019s certainly good to have these skills in a pinch, it\u2019s probably not a wise financial decision to use them all the time if you could instead be engaging in other activities that improve your \u2014 and your family\u2019s \u2014 well-being.
