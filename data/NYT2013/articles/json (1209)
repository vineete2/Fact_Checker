{"headline": "Dancing Across the Generations", "body": "\nOn a September night this year in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, my wife and I, visiting New York from Alabama, head to a bar and restaurant where our daughter is celebrating her 26th birthday. As the evening unfolds and Meredith\u2019s friends pack the place, the music gets louder, with a D.J. favoring Afro-Cuban music laying down a catchy beat.         \n\nThere is eating, drinking, moving about to the pulse, but the little dance floor remains empty. The volume grows.         \n\nAbout midnight, Nancy and I break the ice, rocking and twirling in a mix of jitterbug and salsa. The party crowd gets thicker. Our steps get lighter. Only one twenty-something couple joins us on the floor. As others look on, I know what they must be thinking of us: these parents, in their 28th year of marriage, are still vital, cool.         \n\nBy 1 a.m. we are ready to depart, and Meredith\u2019s friends, their night still fresh, tell us how much they enjoyed meeting us.         \n\n\u201cAnd we loved watching you two dance,\u201d one young woman says. \u201cYou were so cute.\u201d         \n\nCute? I feel dated, quaint, a visitor from a planet of long ago.         \n\n* * *         \n\nFor as long as I can remember, we have danced. My parents began their romance at a dance in Mobile, Ala., and raised me and my three older sisters in a home where the right song on a scratchy Victrola was enough to set off a two-step or rumba.         \n\nIt\u2019s the last night of 1986, and the band at the Grand Hotel in Point Clear, Ala., across the bay from Mobile, is playing \u201cFly Me to the Moon.\u201d I\u2019m 33, and dancing with my mom. She is light in my arms, following, with patient ease, my clumsy foxtrot. Alongside us, as the clock winds toward midnight, Dad sends my Nancy into a slow turn, bringing her back more smoothly than I ever could.         \n\nWe look out to Mobile Bay, a slender moon in the New Year\u2019s Eve sky. The night is chilly, but in here the dance band is cooking.         \n\nA new tune begins \u2013 a peppy \u201cBye, Bye, Blackbird\u201d \u2013 and my mother and I start in. I\u2019m rusty, not sure of my steps, but eighth-grade cotillion training from 1967 is still in my blood.         \n\nMy mom guides me in an easy swing, leading me by deftly following. As she rocks back and I pull her close again she is beaming, exclaiming, \u201cYou\u2019ve got it now.\u201d Then my father is tapping me on the shoulder, cutting back in.         \n\nNancy and I, in our second year of marriage, begin a Cajun step we learned in New Orleans. I look at her, tall and blonde, moving with ease, then over at my parents. In their seventies, their quick step turns back the hands of the clock. I see them not as cute, but stylish, the embodiment of charm. The dance floor burnishes their aura.         \n\nThey are gone now, but not their dancing.         \n\n* * *         \n\nIt was my big sister Becky who got me started when I was 6, turning our living room into \u201cAmerican Bandstand.\u201d While Dick Clark introduced acts like Jerry Lee Lewis on the black-and-white screen, she welcomed boyfriends who pulled up to our curb in freshly waxed Chevys, and girlfriends in saddle oxfords.         \n\nOn her record player in a zippered case, I can still see the 45-r.p.m. recording of Elvis\u2019s \u201cHound Dog\u201d spinning around. When one finished, another clattered onto the turntable. Becky taught me the jitterbug to \u201cBe-Bop-a-Lula.\u201d When heavenly Johnny Mathis crooned at her slumber parties I learned the slow dance, how the woman would lean her head on the shoulder of a man while maintaining a proper distance. As a first grader, I was the practice partner for her 16- and 17-year-old girlfriends. Then the big boys showed up to escort them to the Murphy High hop.         \n\nWhites and blacks were still separate in that pre-civil rights South. At high school football games I went to as a pre-teen, every player, band member, cheerleader and fan was white.         \n\nIn 1958, When Ray Charles played the Harlem Duke Social Club in the predominantly black part of town, only the most adventurous whites might turn up. But that music \u2014 and those dancing styles \u2014 poured into our living rooms.
