{"headline": "Player Ratings: United States (3) vs. Panama (2)", "body": "\nIn one of the most memorable nights in Concacaf World Cup qualifying, the United States rallied late on Tuesday to defeat Panama, 3-2, and toss a lifeline to its arch rival, Mexico.         \n\nThe United States entered the game with little at stake. It had already secured a spot at next year\u2019s World Cup in Brazil and had clinched first place in the hexagonal qualifying tournament. On the other hand, it was facing a heavily motivated Panamanian team that, with a win and a Mexico loss at Costa Rica, could clinch fourth place in the hexagonal and into a playoff with New Zealand for a World Cup berth.         \n\nAfter scoreboards and emotions bounced around throughout the night, the United States rallied for two late goals to eliminate Panama and ensure that Mexico would finish fourth despite its 2-1 loss to Costa Rica. For the Panamanian team, it was the second time the U.S. had dealt it a crushing blow this year; it also lost to Jurgen Klinsmann\u2019s squad in the final of this summer\u2019s Concacaf Gold Cup.         \nMNT vs. Panama: Highlights - Oct. 15, 2013 \n\nWhile there was little risk for the U.S. team, several players \u2014 positioning for places on Klinsmann\u2019s roster for next summer \u2014 rose to the occasion in the win. Jozy Altidore battled hard and rewarded Klinsmann\u2019s faith in naming him the team\u2019s captain for the game. Brad Davis shined off the bench and could still force himself into the mix for one of the 2014 roster spots. And striker Aron Johannsson scored his first goal for the national team in impressive fashion, showing why Klinsmann had pursued him so eagerly for the past year as he debated whether to play for United States or Iceland as a senior international.         \n\nNext up for the Americans will be  \n, against Scotland and Austria, to conclude a busy and successful year.         \n\nThe ratings (on a scale of 1, diabolical; to 10, world class):         \n\n \n         \n\n \n While he could have done better on the cross leading to Luis Tejada\u2019s goal late in the second half, Guzan also came up with some big saves to give his team a chance to win. Rating: 5.5         \n\n \n After a solid outing against Jamaica, Evans struggled to deal with the speed of Panama\u2019s attack. He made some nice passes out of the back, but as he normally plays as a midfielder for Seattle in M.L.S., his performance was step back in his progression as a defender. Rating: 4.5         \n\n \n The San Jose Earthquakes defender has had a good year for the national team and he was solid yet again. He was calm on the ball and his passing out of the back helped the midfield. He is not the quickest defender but he reads the game well to break up attacks. Rating: 6.5         \n\n \n His goal in the 64th minute tied the score \u2014 and saved Mexico \u2014 but defensively he looked uncomfortable. He was slightly out of position on Gabriel Torres\u2019s opening goal for Panama. Rating: 6.0         \n\n \n It was a mixed performance for Castillo. In the first half he completed a high percentage of his passes, but one of the times he missed resulted in Panama\u2019s first goal. Despite that mental mistake, Castillo looked dangerous moving forward and connected well with his teammates; in particular he was instrumental in the buildup on Zusi\u2019s late equalizer. Defensively, Castillo was inconsistent: he made some nice clearances but was also out of position at times. He has been solid off the bench recently, but it is still far from settled if Klinsmann trusts Castillo to start him in a big game. Rating: 5.0         \nMNT vs. Panama: Gabriel Torres Goal - Oct. 15, 2013 \n\n \n Despite having Champions League experience, Kljestan has not been given many opportunities by Klinsmann to start for the national team. In a 90-minute outing against Panama, Kljestan wasn\u2019t flashy but did the dirty work to keep the United States in the game in a hostile environment against a motivated opponent. Rating: 5.5         \n\n \n Playing in place of Jermaine Jones in central midfield, Beckerman had a mixed performance. He could have done better on Panama\u2019s first goal after Castillo\u2019s poor pass, and Panama\u2019s speed was problematic for him. As the game progressed, Beckerman improved and began to control the midfield.
