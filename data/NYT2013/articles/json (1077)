{"headline": "One-Handed Basketball Player Gets a Shot With Florida", "body": "\nMILTON, Ga. \u2014 A referee\u2019s whistle halted play during a recent game at Milton High, a school situated among horse farms in an affluent area north of Atlanta. A foul had been called, leaving the culprit\u2019s coach mystified.         \n\n\u201cWhat did he do?\u201d asked Milton Coach Matt Kramer.         \n\nZach Hodskins, a senior guard, was hand-checking with both hands, the official explained.         \n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Hodskins said, \u201cI don\u2019t even have two hands.\u201d         \n\nBorn without a left hand and forearm, Hodskins was thought to have a better chance to become president of the United States, as a relative imagined when he was an infant, than to play basketball for a college powerhouse. Yet the University of Florida, which won back-to-back national titles in the past decade and reached the N.C.A.A. tournament\u2019s Round of 8 the past three years, recently guaranteed him a roster spot for next season by designating him a preferred walk-on.         \n\nAfter people watch Hodskins sink 3-point shots, lunge for loose balls and unleash his unusual brand of play, what they notice almost as much as his missing hand is the chip on his shoulder. He has converted years of slights, perceived and real, into a continual source of energy that compels him to set lofty goals.         \n\nAt nearly 6 feet 4 inches, Hodskins is a strong passer with extraordinary range. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have 3-point range; it\u2019s in-the-gym range,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cCross halfcourt, he\u2019s in range after a dribble or two.\u201d         \n\nHodskins, who averaged 11 points a game last season and is averaging 6 points and 2.3 assists per game this season, would be assured significant playing time, perhaps even a starting role, at a lower-level college. But his nature made him accept the Gators.         \n\n\u201cZach wants the biggest challenge,\u201d his father, Bob, said. \u201cHe has such an extreme desire to prove himself at the highest level he can.\u201d         \n\nBob and Stephanie Hodskins did not know that Zach would be born without half a limb. Early on, they pledged to rear him as they did his two older sisters \u2014 not that he would have tolerated any coddling.         \n\n\u201cIf you ever tried to help him up,\u201d Bob Hodskins said, \u201che wouldn\u2019t have wanted that.\u201d         \n\nA daredevil from the beginning, Zach would climb out of his crib with a loud thud, alarming his parents.         \n\nSince then, he has dabbled in various sports, from skimboarding to triathlon.         \n\nStephanie Hodskins yielded to one assumed limitation and bought Zach slip-on shoes to spare him laces. Yet he gravitated to shoes with laces, tying them at school as a sort of performance art on request.         \n\nWhen Hodskins locked in on basketball, his footwear of choice became high-top sneakers. He never hid an ambition to play in college, saying recently, \u201cI never doubted myself, even though a lot of people did.\u201d To them, he said, \u201cJust watch.\u201d         \n\nFor every pickup-game captain who did not choose him and every Amateur Athletic Union program that did not invite him, Hodskins stockpiled motivation.         \n\nConcern that he was pushing himself too hard tempered his parents\u2019 pride. Bob Hodskins would tape the calloused fingers on Zach\u2019s right hand when they bled from marathon solo workouts.         \n\n\u201cDial it back,\u201d his father would tell him. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to prove yourself every day.\u201d         \n\nZach would hear none of it. \u201cI love my competitiveness,\u201d he said. \u201cIt got me to where I am today.\u201d         \n\nIn middle school, he went out for cross-country, primarily as conditioning for basketball. He promptly placed second in a meet that left him so exhausted his parents feared for his health. Zach\u2019s explanation: \u201cAllowing anyone to beat me was unacceptable.\u201d         \n\nHis parents removed him from the team. \u201cWe tried to tell him, \u2018You can\u2019t be perfect,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Bob Hodskins said. \u201cHe expects to be so.\u201d         \n\nThe family found two A.A.U. coaches who helped Hodskins develop a repertory of moves, like a crossover dribble between the legs, to minimize the effect of his disability. Fine-tuning took place at gyms, playgrounds and, most often, the Hodskinses\u2019 driveway. The continual thumping of the ball planted a nagging question: Would the investment pay off?         \n\nZach\u2019s parents never imagined how much it would. A year ago, a scouting service posted a  \n of Hodskins\u2019s highlights on YouTube that has nearly four million views.
