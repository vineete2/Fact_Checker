{"headline": "Judge Throws Out Officers\u2019 Convictions in Killings After Hurricane Katrina", "body": "\nNEW ORLEANS \u2014 Citing \u201cgrotesque prosecutorial misconduct\u201d on the part of federal lawyers here and in Washington, a judge on Tuesday threw out the  \n of five former police officers who had been found guilty in a momentous civil rights case of killing two citizens and engaging in an extensive cover-up in the days after  \n.         \n\nIn a heated 129-page decision, Judge Kurt D. Englehardt of Federal District Court here declared that federal prosecutors had created a \u201cprejudicial, poisonous atmosphere\u201d in making anonymous online comments before and during the trial at  \n, the Web site of The Times-Picayune, and ordered a new trial for all five officers.         \n\nThe decision represented the collapse, for now, of a case that was seen as symbolizing both the profound breakdown of law and order after the hurricane and a deep rot\u00a0within the city\u2019s police department that dated back well before the storm.\u00a0         \n\nWhile a scandal over anonymous online commenting had already cut short the federal careers of two local prosecutors and the United States attorney himself, Tuesday\u2019s decision identified another, previously unknown commenter: a veteran lawyer in the Department of Justice in Washington who had a role in preparing the case for trial.         \n\n\u201cThis case started as one featuring allegations of brazen abuse of authority, violation of the law and corruption of the criminal justice system,\u201d the decision read. \u201cUnfortunately though the focus has shifted from the accused to the accusers, it has continued to be about those very issues.\u201d         \n\nThe vacating of the 2011 convictions, which were hailed by the city\u2019s officials and by Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., was another setback for a wide-ranging federal campaign to reform the New Orleans Police Department and hold some of its officers accountable for past abuse. A consent decree mandating full-scale departmental changes, announced with fanfare by the city and the Justice Department last summer, is now being appealed by city officials, who said they were unaware of the costs of a separate decree being negotiated that concerns the troubled city jail.         \n\nThe most notorious of several criminal investigations concerned the shootings on the Danziger Bridge on Sept 4, 2005, when the streets were still flooded and citizens were scavenging for basic supplies. Responding to a distress call, officers raced to the bridge and, according to testimony of witnesses, opened fire without warning, leaving four badly injured and James Brisette, 17, and Ronald Madison, a mentally disabled 40-year-old, dead. Trial witnesses described the cover-up that followed, beginning at the scene with the arrest of Ronald\u2019s brother, Lance Madison.         \n\nThe case wound its way through the system, first falling apart in state court over grand jury improprieties before being taken over by federal prosecutors in 2008. Four officers \u2014 Kenneth Bowen, Robert Gisevius, Anthony Villavaso and Robert Faulcon \u2014 were eventually convicted in connection to the shooting itself. Another, former Detective Arthur Kaufman, was convicted for his part in the cover-up.         \n\nJudge Englehardt, who declared a mistrial last year in the case of another officer involved in the Danziger case, had long been critical of the prosecution. At the defendants\u2019 sentencing last year, the judge, an appointee of President George W. Bush, criticized federal prosecutors for the plea deals that had been offered to cooperating witnesses, among other things.         \n\nSome of these criticisms were raised in Tuesday\u2019s decision, but the main objections concerned the behavior of prosecutors online.         \n\nThat someone in the United States attorney\u2019s office had been anonymously commenting on  \n was first revealed in the spring of 2012 by lawyers representing the target of a high-profile corruption investigation. The revelations were the talk of New Orleans as lawyers identified a longtime assistant United States attorney, Sal Perricone, as a prolific and rather acerbic commenter under several handles. The targets of his commentary were varied and included the police department, which he called \u201ccorrupt,\u201d \u201cineffectual\u201d and \u201ca joke.\u201d         \n\nSeveral months later, Jan Mann, the office\u2019s second-highest-ranking prosecutor, was also revealed to have been commenting anonymously. In the wake of this disclosure, Jim Letten, at the time the longest-serving United States attorney in the country, stepped down.         \n\nNeither Mr. Perricone nor Ms. Mann was a part of the federal trial prosecution team. But the defendants, citing Mr. Perricone\u2019s extensive online comments about the case, had already requested a new trial.
