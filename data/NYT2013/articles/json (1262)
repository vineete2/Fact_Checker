{"headline": "Blogging With Video, Hoping to Go Viral", "body": "\nIt would take 72 hours to watch all the videos uploaded to YouTube every minute by would-be commentators, comedians, cosmetologists and various other content creators all hoping for a breakout hit.         \n\nAnd, let\u2019s be honest, most of it is cringe-worthy.         \n\nWhile the vagaries of taste and timing determine which videos go viral and which YouTube channels develop large and loyal followings, it\u2019s easier to tell which videos will make viewers feel as if they can\u2019t click away fast enough.         \n\nIt boils down to narcissism. If you\u2019re an aspiring video blogger, remember, it\u2019s not about you, it\u2019s about who is watching you. Be conscious and considerate of your audience and its needs, rather than getting mired in your own egotism or insecurity. (It\u2019s good advice for life but essential to making quality video.)         \n\nOf course you want to have a decent camera. \u201cIf you have an iPhone or Android phone, you pretty much do,\u201d said  \n, a video consultant in San Francisco, who produces content mostly for corporate clients. A hand-held video camera is nice and offers more features and flexibility, but your smartphone is fine.         \n\nThe only additional equipment you might consider is a separate  \n ($100-$200) for clearer audio. And if there isn\u2019t enough ambient light to illuminate your face, spring for a  \n ($10-$20) that you can find at most hardware stores. No one wants to watch you talking in the dark like someone in a witness protection program. For a flattering glow, Mr. Codel suggested putting wax paper in front of the lamp to diffuse the light.         \n\nO.K., so now you\u2019re ready to perform \u2014 and you are always performing when the camera is rolling. \u201cIf you can\u2019t communicate in an interesting, entertaining, energetic way \u2014 I don\u2019t care how much education you have, how brilliant you are, how many degrees you have \u2014 it\u2019s going to be painful to watch you,\u201d said  \n, a television producer and online video consultant in Los Angeles. \u201c \n is not on TV because he\u2019s the best therapist in the world, and  \n is not the best chef in the world. They are good performers.\u201d         \n\nThat\u2019s not to say you have to have an outsize personality or acting experience. But you do need to be comfortable in front of the camera, which is no easy feat. \u201cThere\u2019s something sort of horrifying and anxiety-producing about shooting when you are alone,\u201d said  \n, who has more than 126,000 subscribers to his YouTube channel and whose quirky videos can attract as many as 20 million views.         \n\nThe camera lens is a dark, bottomless void that doesn\u2019t provide the feedback you get in normal face-to-face conversation, like a nod, a raised eyebrow and utterances like \u201chmmm\u201d and \u201caah.\u201d Lacking that, people tend to focus more on themselves and, in their self-consciousness, become either bland and monotone (as interesting as a lecture on the  \n) or hyper-excited and agitated (as annoying as a  \n).         \n\nMr. Frank, who lives in Los Angeles, said he tended to \u201cover-gesticulate and mug too aggressively to the camera\u201d when he first started posting Web videos in 2006. Now he has another person in the room operating the camera. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to have someone else there to tell you if you are falling a little flat or that look was so cheesy it\u2019s just ridiculous,\u201d Mr. Frank said. Buzzfeed bought his channel last year, and he is now the company\u2019s executive vice president for video, while continuing to create his own content.         \n\nIf you don\u2019t have the money to hire a camera operator or a willing friend to watch you record, just imagine you are talking to your typical viewer. \u201cYour only concern should be how it\u2019s going to benefit who is watching,\u201d said  \n, a media consultant and former actress whose past clients include the celebrity chefs Ina Garten and Bobby Flay. \u201cWhen you do that, you take the focus off yourself and put it into what you want to get across, which changes the way you communicate,\u201d she said.         \n\nYou don\u2019t even necessarily have to be on camera.  \n, of the YouTube channel \u201c \n,\u201d never appears in his cooking tutorials, which can attract as many as two million views. All you see are his hands at work in his San Francisco kitchen.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not, \u2018Here I am, check out my personality.\u2019 It\u2019s, \u2018Let\u2019s make this thing,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Mr. Mitzewich, whose clever voice-over might compare peaking egg whites to \u201ca voluptuous woman under a white cotton sheet.\u201d  \n bought his channel, which has 308,000 subscribers, last year, but he continues to have creative control. \u201cThe whole \u2018follow your bliss\u2019 thing totally works out,\u201d he said.         \n\nOnline video is different from television or film in that the audience is often watching on a small screen (laptop, tablet or smartphone). Viewers are up close, leaning in and may also be interacting with the content by posting comments, so it feels more intimate. \u201cThe viewer wants to be spoken to as a friend would talk to them,\u201d said Ben Relles, head of programming strategy for YouTube, a division of Google. \u201cThey view these channels as friendships.\u201d         \n\nAs a result, they gravitate toward creators who seem genuine and responsive, like  \n, a musician and professed nerd with soulful eyes, who has 1.8 million subscribers to the video blog, or vlog, he films in his London apartment. Or  \n, who has attracted almost six million subscribers by her Tourette-like revelations of whatever is on her peculiar and profane mind.         \n\nMoreover, viewers appreciate content that they can\u2019t get elsewhere. Creators are successful when they tap into \u201cnarrow but deep niches,\u201d said  \n, senior vice president for content at Blip, a curated Web video site.         \n\nPaul Klusman, an engineer in Wichita, Kan., gained fame from his cat videos, in which he talks comically yet earnestly about the pleasures (companionship) and pains (kitty constipation) of cat ownership. The first video he made,  \n was rejected by a short-film festival. But when he posted it on YouTube in 2008, it went viral with almost six million views and several marriage proposals.         \n\nHe now has more than 33,000 subscribers with whom he regularly communicates (and sometimes dates). \u201cI\u2019m not a YouTube superstar, but I\u2019m on the map,\u201d said Mr. Klusman, who added that he also earns a nice supplemental income through advertising on his channel but \u201cnot enough for me to want to live on.\u201d         \n\nWhile Mr. Klusman\u2019s videos can be as long as seven minutes, most online media specialists say it\u2019s better to crisply edit videos down to two to four minutes. That means getting rid of any vanity shots and self-indulgent rambling. \u201cYou want to be clean and concise, and if you don\u2019t grab viewers in the first 15 seconds, they\u2019re gone and aren\u2019t coming back,\u201d said Ms. Melamed, the producer and consultant. You don\u2019t need fancy editing software either. Programs like  \n and Windows  \n, which come standard on many computers, are adequate.         \n\nA last bit of advice is to be consistent in churning out content. Post at least weekly if your vlog is topical. If you are more interested in building a library of content like tutorials, the time between postings can be longer.         \n\n\u201cBe patient and realize you are probably going to be a bit terrible in the beginning,\u201d Mr. Frank said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t end up making a living at it, there are other reasons to create online media. It\u2019s certainly a validation of life.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/technology/personaltech/how-to-make-your-video-go-viral.html", "date": "2013-02-13", "description": "The first rule for would-be video bloggers: Don\u2019t let your ego get between the camera and the audience."}
