{"headline": "Pick Your Brazil XI for the World Cup", "body": "\nEvery World Cup coach will have difficult decisions to make before the tournament opens next June \u2014 which players to take and leave home, which ones to start or sit \u2014 but few will face more second-guessing than Brazil\u2019s Luiz Felipe Scolari.         \n\nBrazil is a nation of self-appointed soccer experts, and given the pressure on Scolari to deliver a title for the host country, every decision he makes will be open to often-vociferous debate. Veteran players or young players? A team of European professionals, or one that includes some Brazil-based stars?         \n\nGiven the talent pool he will fish in, Scolari has options that any coach would envy. Or pity. Barcelona forward Neymar is an easy choice for any Brazil starting XI, but to most minds so are defenders Thiago Silva and Dani Alves and the Chelsea midfielders Ramires and Oscar. But then what? Flashy, attack-minded sidekicks like A.C. Milan\u2019s Robinho? Sturdier stock like Hulk and Fred up front? A sentimental choice like Ronaldinho?         \n\nScolari will sort all of that out next spring. But what would you do? Pick your Brazil XI, or share your thoughts on selections, omissions, formations and tactics in the comments.
