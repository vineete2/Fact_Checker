Nearly 100 people \u2014 the seven who live here full time, six who are here part time, and assorted children, grandchildren and friends, including Laura Hartman, one of the architects who designed the complex \u2014 spent two days barbecuing, talking, hiking through the redwoods and competing to see who could bake the best cheesecake. (The competition was in honor of the community\u2019s name, which is derived from a loose translation of Casada, the surname of the family who owned the 20-acre property at the turn of the 19th century.)         \n\nThe younger and more adventurous among them slept in tents or tepees in the meadow (Ms. Hartman brought her own pup tent), while older visitors bunked together in the residential buildings or stayed in hotels nearby.         \n\nIt was a fittingly multigenerational celebration for an idea inspired by the parents of some of the original members, who became increasingly isolated with age: no one should have to grow old alone.         \n\nIn 1994, The New York Times reported on how those members, or \u201cpartners,\u201d as they called themselves, had settled into their first year of life as a community ( \n). It was one of a number of such experiments, known as cohousing communities, that were springing up around the country at the time, based on a Danish model developed in the 1960s.         \n\nThe original group of 11 included four married couples and three women, all in their 50s and 60s, each of whom agreed to pay a monthly fee for the mortgage, taxes and insurance on the 6,000-square-foot complex, as well as a small daily usage charge for utilities whenever they were in residence (food and phone bills were handled individually). Bedrooms and some bathrooms were private, but nearly everything else was shared, an arrangement that seemed feasible given the longstanding friendships of most of the members, who had started a cooperative nursery school for their children when they lived in Southern California in the 1960s. Still, there were three buildings in the complex (two that contained common areas and private apartments and one where residents could pursue their hobbies), because, as Ms. Hartman said in the 1994 article, \u201cEveryone under one roof made people nervous.\u201d         \n\nHow did the experiment turn out? On the 20th anniversary, the consensus was generally positive.         \n\nAs Helen Papke, 84, observed, it has been a lesson in patience. \u201cWhen it\u2019s good, it\u2019s so good,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd when it\u2019s bad, it\u2019s so bad, the angst and argument we have with each other. But we have a conviction to work it out \u2014 and we will.\u201d         \n\nDick Browning, 78, whose wife, Louise, died in 2007, was more effusive. \u201cI love it,\u201d he said. \u201cI love the community.\u201d         \n\nOf the original 11 members, seven are still here, although apart from Ms. Browning, no one has died. (One couple and one woman left for personal reasons.) The community has taken on new members, so there are now 13 altogether.         \n\nNo one seems lonely, but some of the residents aren\u2019t quite as energetic as they once were. Take Daniel Myers, a retired lawyer who moved in with his wife, Jill, in 1993, when he was 60. Now, he said, \u201cI can\u2019t get on the roof to get the leaves off, and I can\u2019t chop wood.\u201d         \n\nAnd needless to say, there have been plenty of compromises along the way. Even something as simple as cutting down a tree or buying a new dishwasher requires a consensus, or at least the agreement of three-quarters of the residents. And getting that many people to agree on anything can take a while.         \n\nAsk Sophie Otis, a clinical psychologist who is now 77, who had to lobby for almost two decades to get rid of the tree obstructing the view from her window. In 1993, when she moved in, it was only six feet tall and she could see around it. Ten years later, at 30 feet, it was starting to block the light. But it wasn\u2019t until January, when it was 45 feet tall and threatening to fall down, that the community agreed to remove it, Ms. Otis said.         \n\n\u201cThey finally cut it down this year, not because of my problem with the view,\u201d she said, \u201cbut because it was blocking the light and was a hazard in lots of ways.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/19/garden/till-death-or-decorating-disputes-do-us-part.html", "date": "2013-09-18", "description": "A group of friends decided to grow old together 20 years ago, and today they say their experiment in communal living has had its rewards but is not for the stubborn."}
