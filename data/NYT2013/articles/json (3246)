{"headline": "House Approves Bill That Allows Policy Renewals", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Defying a veto threat from President Obama, the House approved legislation on Friday that would allow insurance companies to renew individual health insurance policies and sell similar ones to new customers next year even if the coverage does not provide all the benefits and consumer protections required by the new health care law.         \n\nThe vote was 261 to 157, with 39 Democrats bucking their party leadership and the White House to vote in favor of the bill. Hours after the vote, Mr. Obama and top aides met for over an hour with insurance executives\u00a0 after industry leaders complained Thursday that they had been blindsided by a  \n. The president described the meeting as a \u201cbrainstorming\u201d session about how to ensure changes to the health care law go smoothly.         \n\nThe insurance representatives, from more than a dozen companies, said they would work with the administration to protect the financial viability of the new marketplaces, but did not say how. Afterward, Karen Ignagni, the president of America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group, said it was a  \n but would not go into detail.         \n\nThe legislation approved by the House would go further than the fix announced on Thursday by Mr. Obama, who said he would temporarily waive some requirements of the law and allow insurers to renew \u201ccurrent policies for current enrollees\u201d for a year.         \n\nMany of the Democrats who supported the bill are facing tough re-election fights back home, and expressed deep frustration with how the administration had handled the early carrying out of Mr. Obama\u2019s signature health care law. Representative Nick J. Rahall II, Democrat of West Virginia, who voted for the legislation, said that the White House deserved an \u201cF-minus\u201d for its botched rollout of the Affordable Care Act.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m disgusted about it,\u201d Mr. Rahall said. \u201cI think heads should roll downtown. Whoever was responsible or may have known that this was going to occur should no longer be employed.\u201d         \n\nRepresentative Ron Barber, Democrat of Arizona, who also joined Republicans in voting for the bill, was equally scathing, calling the rollout \u201ca disaster.\u201d         \n\n\u201cMy constituents are pretty upset,\u201d he said, \u201cand so am I.\u201d         \n\nRepresentative Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan and the chief sponsor of the House bill, said it would fulfill a promise that Mr. Obama had made to the American people and then broken.         \n\n\u201cIn the last three years,\u201d Mr. Upton said, \u201cthe president personally promised that if people liked their current health care plan, they could keep it \u2018no matter what.\u2019 But cancellation notices are now arriving in millions of mailboxes across the country. It\u2019s cancellation today, sticker shock tomorrow.\u201d         \n\nMr. Upton, the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, belittled Mr. Obama\u2019s proposal, saying it was offered at the last minute, \u201cas the administration\u2019s allies in Congress panicked.\u201d         \n\nSenior Democrats criticized the Upton legislation as a ploy that could unravel the entire health care law.         \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t pretend you care about the American people\u2019s health care here,\u201d said Representative Mike Doyle, Democrat of Pennsylvania. \u201cYou just want to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Democrats are not going to let you do that.\u201d         \n\nAnd Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, said insurers, in discussing the bill, had had \u201csignificant concerns on how it would work operationally.\u201d         \n\nThe outlook for the legislation is unclear in the Senate, where Democrats running for re-election in 2014 are looking for a way to help consumers facing the loss of insurance policies that do not meet requirements of the 2010 law.         \n\nSenator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, was one of the first Democrats to break with the White House and offer her own proposal, which would allow people to keep their current plans indefinitely.         \n\nHowever, after the president\u2019s turnabout on Thursday, many Senate Democrats said they were waiting to see if additional legislation was necessary, and quick action in the Senate is not expected.         \n\nHouse Democrats on Friday used a procedural maneuver to offer a plan of their own called \u201cLandrieu lite.\u201d It was similar to the president\u2019s proposal in its approach, and it gave Democrats some political cover in that it showed them taking action on the issue.\u00a0         \n\nThe Democratic proposal, which was rejected by Republicans, would have allowed people who like their current plans to retain them for a year. Under the Democratic proposal, unlike with Mr. Upton\u2019s bill, insurers would not be allowed to sell plans that previously faced cancellation to new customers.
