The company confirmed that its Web site had come under attack.         \n\nThe assault, which took American Express offline for two hours, was the latest in an intensifying campaign of unusually powerful attacks on American financial institutions that began last September and have taken dozens of them offline intermittently, costing millions of dollars.         \n\n \n was taken offline by a similar attack this month. And last week, a separate, aggressive attack incapacitated 32,000 computers at  \n\u2019s banks and television networks.         \n\nThe culprits of these attacks, officials and experts say, appear intent on disabling financial transactions and operations.         \n\nCorporate leaders have long feared online attacks aimed at financial fraud or economic espionage, but now a new threat has taken hold: attackers, possibly with state backing, who seem bent on destruction.         \n\n\u201cThe attacks have changed from espionage to destruction,\u201d said Alan Paller, director of research at the SANS Institute, a cybersecurity training organization. \u201cNations are actively testing how far they can go before we will respond.\u201d         \n\nSecurity experts who studied the attacks said that it was part of the same campaign that took down the Web sites of JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and others over the last six months. A group that calls itself the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Fighters has claimed responsibility for those attacks.         \n\nThe group says it is retaliating for an anti-Islamic video posted on YouTube last fall. But American intelligence officials and industry investigators say they believe the group is a convenient cover for  \n. Just how tight the connection is \u2014 or whether the group is acting on direct orders from the Iranian government \u2014 is unclear. Government officials and bank executives have failed to produce a smoking gun.         \n\n \n is considered the most likely source of the attacks on South Korea, though investigators are struggling to follow the digital trail, a process that could take months. The North Korean government of Kim Jong-un has openly declared that it is seeking online targets in its neighbor to the south to exact economic damage.         \n\nRepresentatives of American Express confirmed that the company was under attack Thursday, but said that there was no evidence that customer data had been compromised. A representative of the Federal Bureau of Investigation did not respond to a request for comment on the American Express attack.         \n\nSpokesmen for JPMorgan Chase said they would not talk about the recent attack there, its origins or its consequences. JPMorgan has openly acknowledged previous denial of service attacks. But the size and severity of the most recent one apparently led it to reconsider.         \n\nThe Obama administration has publicly urged companies to be more transparent about attacks, but often security experts and lawyers give the opposite advice.         \n\nThe largest contingent of instigators of attacks in the private sector, government officials and researchers say, remains Chinese hackers intent on stealing corporate secrets.         \n\nThe American and South Korean attacks underscore a growing fear that the two countries most worrisome to banks, oil producers and governments may be Iran and North Korea, not because of their skill but because of their brazenness. Neither country is considered a superstar in this area. The appeal of digital weapons is similar to that of nuclear capability: it is a way for an outgunned, outfinanced nation to even the playing field. \u201cThese countries are pursuing cyberweapons the same way they are pursuing  \n,\u201d said James A. Lewis, a computer security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s primitive; it\u2019s not top of the line, but it\u2019s good enough and they are committed to getting it.\u201d         \n\nAmerican officials are currently weighing their response options, but the issues involved are complex. At a meeting of banking executives, regulators and representatives from the departments of Homeland Security and Treasury last December, some pressed the United States to hit back at the hackers, while others argued that doing so would only lead to more aggressive attacks, according to two people who attended the meeting.         \n\nThe difficulty of deterring such attacks was also the focus of a White House meeting this month with Mr. Obama and business leaders, including the chief executives Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase; Brian T. Moynihan of Bank of America; Rex W. Tillerson of Exxon Mobil; Randall L. Stephenson of AT&T and others.         \n\nMr. Obama\u2019s goal was to erode the business community\u2019s intense opposition to federal legislation that would give the government oversight of how companies protect \u201ccritical infrastructure,\u201d like banking systems and energy and cellphone networks. That opposition killed a bill last year, prompting Mr. Obama to sign an executive order promoting increased information-sharing with businesses.         \n\n\u201cBut I think we heard a new tone at this latest meeting,\u201d an Obama aide said later. \u201cSix months of unrelenting attacks have changed some views.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/29/technology/corporate-cyberattackers-possibly-state-backed-now-seek-to-destroy-data.html", "date": "2013-03-28", "description": "Corporate leaders have long feared hacking in service of fraud or spying, but now a new threat has taken hold: attackers, possibly with state support, who seem bent on destruction."}
