{"headline": "A Chance at Learning", "body": "\nThis year, a study administered by researchers at Harvard and Stanford drew significant attention for what it revealed about  \n at selective colleges and universities. Only 34 percent of the highest-achieving high-school seniors whose families fell in the bottom quarter of income distribution \u2014 versus 78 percent in the top quarter \u2014 attended one of the country\u2019s most selective colleges, based on a list of nearly 250 schools compiled by Barron\u2019s.         \n\nIn New York City, where a neighborhood like Bushwick, in Brooklyn, can seem like a satellite campus of Wesleyan and a prewar apartment building on the Upper East Side can feel like an Ivy League dormitory for 46-year-olds, there has been considerable philanthropic attention, of the kind other cities ought to envy, paid to finding the most gifted low-income students and putting them on a similar path.         \n\nIn 1978, Gary Simons, a Bronx teacher, founded  \n with the goal of identifying talented students of color in the city and readying them for attendance at private schools like Dalton and Groton and so on. Hundreds of the program\u2019s alumni have gone on to law, medical and business schools, and employment at Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Time Warner.         \n\nA decade ago, hoping also to advance the best students attending public high schools, Mr. Simons and others founded another organization, Leadership Enterprise for a Diverse America, or  \n, which draws exceptional children from around the country, regardless of race, almost entirely from families who make less than $55,000 a year. Applicants are required to be in the top 10 percent of their class, having taken the most difficult courses their schools offer. The 60 who gain entry to the program each year spend the summer before 12th grade at Princeton, studying ethics, political theory and public policy, and preparing for standardized college entrance exams.         \n\nIn a wondrous righting of the current disequilibrium, however small its scale, they are tutored for those tests by the same instructors who work with some of Manhattan\u2019s wealthiest teenagers: the staff of Advantage Testing, whose services cost parents up to $795 an hour.  \n, the founder and president of Advantage and a major benefactor of LEDA, provides his employees (whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9s typically resemble those of the people at Google or McKinsey) pro bono.         \n\nLEDA has been very successful. Of the 500 or so students who have graduated from the program, three quarters have gone on to top-tier colleges, 30 percent of them to the Ivy League. Among LEDA\u2019s 2012 graduates alone, 19 gained admission to Princeton, 11 to Georgetown and 6 to the University of Pennsylvania.         \n\nLast week I took a walk around Red Hook, Brooklyn, with Joshua El-Bey, a LEDA graduate who was leaving in a few days for his sophomore year at Yale. His family struggled as he grew up, moving often and ultimately landing in the Red Hook Houses, the borough\u2019s largest public housing development. His first memories of book learning, he told me, were the readings his mother delivered from Genesis when he was 2. What was disconcerting about Mr. El-Bey\u2019s otherwise incredibly inspiring trajectory was how much of his success had depended on opportunities outside the public education system.         \n\nBullied in middle school for his studiousness, Mr. El-Bey hoped to gain admission to one of the city\u2019s elite specialized public high schools, but he did not do well enough on the entrance exam. The free tutoring provided by the city for the test was insufficient, he said.         \n\nHe ended up at Edward R. Murrow in Midwood, Brooklyn, a good school whose academics were nevertheless surpassed by the supplemental training he received as a scholar at Sponsors for Educational Opportunity, an organization begun 50 years ago by Manhattan lawyers and advertising executives as a mentoring program to get poor minority students into good colleges. Today it essentially provides a shadow education. In school, Mr. El-Bey told me, he simply learned to \u201cregurgitate facts.\u201d         \n\nPrograms like LEDA and  \n are popular with wealthy, supremely educated donors, precisely because of outcomes like Mr. El-Bey\u2019s. Just this May, the financier  \n pledged $4 million in matching gifts to SEO         \n\nAnd in a city as dense with talent and money as New York, the effects of such philanthropy can be effortlessly observed. Walking through his neighborhood, Mr. El-Bey ran into another alumnus of SEO, Luis Hernandez, who was about to begin his freshman year at the University of Southern California. In a precocious accomplishment more typical in other neighborhoods, Mr. Hernandez had won a screenwriting contest for a film about obesity that had already made its debut on the Showtime cable channel.         \n\nAs a society we have begun to pay increasing and essential attention to gaining access to the top, but the brightest among us might do well to apply equal focus to how we might enhance the middle.         \n\nMost students, rich or poor, will not go to Harvard, while plenty of working-class and poor students will go to colleges that serve them not nearly well enough. Not long ago, our son\u2019s caregiver, who is taking classes at LaGuardia Community College in Queens, showed me a paper she had written for a class in English composition taught by a teacher who was consistently late and twice absent. It was on Ibsen\u2019s \u201cA Doll\u2019s House\u201d and my husband had helped her. It incisively analyzed the play\u2019s theme of 19th-century marital oppression and was impeccably written.         \n\nWhen our nanny received her grade, she was shocked not to have done as well as she had expected. Her formatting had been imprecise, the teacher told her. And there was a problem with spacing. Content seemed not to matter much at all.
