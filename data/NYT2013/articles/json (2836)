{"headline": "Senate Vote on Workplace Bias Against Gays Poses a Test for the G.O.P.", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A major test of how carefully Republicans can navigate the intraparty politics of sexuality will come on Monday, when the Senate holds a crucial vote on a bill to outlaw workplace discrimination against gay men, lesbians and transgender people.         \n\nThe anticipated vote comes four months after the Supreme Court invalidated a federal ban on recognizing  \n, and nearly a year after some conservative leaders warned that losses in the 2012 elections exposed the party as being out of touch with much of the country on social issues.         \n\nWith the bill apparently just one vote short of the threshold to prevent a  \n, the Republican senators believed to be the most persuadable \u2014 Rob Portman of Ohio, Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Dean Heller of Nevada \u2014 were keeping their positions private.         \n\nPolitical strategists and congressional aides who have been lobbying for the bill say they have received private assurances that there will be enough Republican votes to move the measure forward on Monday, but none of the senators who plan to support it want to say so publicly out of concern that they could become targets by groups opposing the measure.         \n\nIn the House, the best chance for passage this year seems to be to tack the measure onto a larger piece of legislation like the National Defense Authorization Act and hope that conservatives do not revolt.         \n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve been told your entire career that Republican primary voters are hostile on these issues, and people have only just started to educate you otherwise,\u201d said Jeff Cook-McCormac, a Republican lobbyist who has been pushing to get the bill enacted, \u201cit takes a little while for that to sink in.\u201d         \n\nWhile opposition appears less organized than in previous gay rights debates in Congress, senators of both parties said the emotion surrounding the issue had complicated efforts to break a Republican filibuster attempt.         \n\nOne senator recalled having to explain to a colleague that the legislation would not require insurance companies to pay for sex-change operations. Another spoke of phone calls from constituents who were convinced that their children could be taught in school by men wearing dresses. And conservative groups like the Family Research Council are warning their supporters that the bill would force Christian bookstores to hire drag performers.         \n\nTo break through the misinformation, supporters said, they have presented senators with polls showing that a majority of Republican voters favor protections for gay, lesbian and transgender workers. And they have made appeals to bedrock Republican principles.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Lincoln guy,\u201d said Norm Coleman, a Republican former senator from Minnesota who is lobbying for the bill, known as the  \n. \u201cSo if you go back to who we are, what we are about as a party \u2014 economic freedom, equality, the right to earn a living \u2014 this makes sense.\u201d         \n\nDemocrats are confident they will have a good outcome regardless of the final vote, and have pressed ahead despite not being absolutely certain that the bill can pass. If they succeed, it will be the first time the Senate has passed an anti-discrimination bill that protects gay men and lesbians. One failed in 1996, the last time the issue came to a vote on the floor.         \n\nAnd if it fails this time, Democrats will be able to frame the loss as a victory by Republican extremists.         \n\n\u201cHow can they justify voting against it?\u201d said Barney Frank, who tried to get a nondiscrimination bill passed when he was a Democratic congressman from Massachusetts.         \n\nWhen Mr. Frank pushed the bill through the House in 2007 \u2014 it would go nowhere in the Senate that year \u2014 he had to drop the transgender provision. \u201cUnfortunately, in 2007 we still had the \u2018ick\u2019 factor when people were confronted with transgender,\u201d recalled Mr. Frank, one of only a few openly gay or lesbian members of the House at the time.         \n\nSenator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican who has led the effort in the Senate to persuade more Republicans to vote for the bill, said some colleagues had raised concerns about how transgender people would have to be accommodated, including one who was concerned about insurance covering sex changes. But by and large, she said, she came away from conversations encouraged that many Republicans seemed to be willing to re-evaluate their views on sexual orientation, gender identity and the law.
