{"headline": "In California, It\u2019s U.S. vs. State Over Marijuana", "body": "\nSTOCKTON, Calif. \u2014 Matthew R. Davies graduated from college with a master\u2019s degree in business and a taste for enterprise, working in real estate, restaurants and mobile home parks before seizing on what he saw as uncharted territory with a vast potential for profits \u2014  \n.         \n\nHe brought graduate-level business skills to a world decidedly operating in the shadows. He hired accountants, compliance lawyers, managers, a staff of 75 and a payroll firm. He paid California sales tax and filed for state and local business permits.         \n\nBut in a case that highlights the growing clash between the federal government and those states that have legalized marijuana for medical or recreational use, the  \n indicted Mr. Davies six months ago on charges of cultivating marijuana, after raiding two dispensaries and a warehouse filled with nearly 2,000 marijuana plants.         \n\nThe United States attorney for the Eastern District of California, Benjamin B. Wagner, a 2009 Obama appointee, wants Mr. Davies to agree to a plea that includes a mandatory minimum of five years in prison, calling the case a straightforward prosecution of \u201cone of the most significant commercial marijuana traffickers to be prosecuted in this district.\u201d         \n\nAt the center of this federal-state collision is a round-faced 34-year-old father of two young girls. Displaying a sheaf of legal documents, Mr. Davies, who has no criminal record, insisted in an interview that he had meticulously followed California law in setting up a business in 2009 that generated $8 million in annual revenues. By all appearances, Mr. Davies\u2019 dispensaries operated as openly as the local Krispy Kreme, albeit on decidedly more tremulous legal ground.         \n\n\u201cTo be looking at 15 years of our life, you couldn\u2019t pay me enough to give that up,\u201d Mr. Davies said at the dining room table in his two-story home along the San Joaquin River Delta, referring to the amount of time he could potentially serve in prison. \u201cIf I had believed for a minute this would happen, I would never have gotten into this.         \n\n\u201cWe thought, this is an industry in its infancy, it\u2019s a heavy cash business, it\u2019s basically being used by people who use it to cloak illegal activity. Nobody was doing it the right way. We thought we could make a model of how this should be done.\u201d         \n\nHis lawyers appealed this month to Attorney General  \n to halt what they suggested was a prosecution at odds with Justice Department policies to avoid prosecutions of medical marijuana users and with President Obama\u2019s statement that the government has \u201c \n\u201d than recreational marijuana users.         \n\n\u201cDoes this mean that the federal government will be prosecuting individuals throughout California, Washington, Colorado and elsewhere who comply with state law permitting marijuana use, or is the Davies case merely a rogue prosecutor out of step with administration and department policy?\u201d asked  \n, one of his lawyers.         \n\n\u201cThis is not a case of an illicit drug ring under the guise of medical marijuana,\u201d Mr. Peters wrote. \u201cHere, marijuana was provided to qualified adult patients with a medical recommendation from a licensed physician. Records were kept, proceeds were tracked, payroll and sales taxes were duly paid.\u201d         \n\nMr. Holder\u2019s aides declined to comment, referring a reporter to a letter from Mr. Wagner to Mr. Davies\u2019s lawyers in which he disputed the depiction of the defendant as anything other than a major-league drug trafficker.         \n\n\u201cMr. Davies was not a seriously ill user of marijuana nor was he a medical caregiver \u2014 he was the major player in a very significant commercial operation that sought to make large profits from the cultivation and sale of marijuana,\u201d the letter said. Mr. Wagner said that prosecuting such people \u201cremains a core priority of the department.\u201d         \n\nThe case illustrates the struggle states and the federal government are now facing as they seek to deal with the changing contours of marijuana laws and public attitudes toward the drug. Colorado and Washington legalized marijuana for recreational use last year, and are among the 18 states, and the District of Columbia, that currently  \n its medical use.         \n\nTwo of Mr. Davies\u2019s co-defendants are pleading guilty, agreeing to five-year minimum terms, to avoid stiffer sentences. Mr. Davies, while saying he did not \u201cwant to be a martyr,\u201d decided to challenge the indictment with a combination of legal and public-relations measures, setting up a  \n and hiring  \n, a hard-hitting political consultant and former senior aide in Bill Clinton\u2019s White House.         \n\nAmong Mr. Davies\u2019s advocates here in California are Paul I. Bonell, who was the president of the Premier Credit Union for 21 years before Mr. Davies hired him in early 2011 to oversee his businesses\u2019 fiscal controls. After the businesses were raided in October that year, Mr. Bonell took a position as the head of the Lodi Boys and Girls Club.         \n\n\u201cI had some reservations going in,\u201d he said of Mr. Davies\u2019s enterprise. \u201cBut the industry was exploding. Matt wanted to have internal controls in place. And we thought: This was a legitimate business. If the State of California deems it legitimate, we want to be the best at it.\u201d         \n\nMr. Davies\u2019s accountant, David M. Silva, said he set up spreadsheets to keep track of inventories, revenues and expenses. \u201cI\u2019ve been a C.P.A. for 30 years,\u201d Mr. Silva said. \u201cWhat I saw was a guy who was trying to run an operation in an up-and-up way.\u201d         \n\nThe federal authorities said they stumbled across the operation after two men were spotted apparently breaking into Mr. Davies\u2019s 30,000-square-foot Stockton warehouse. The police said they smelled marijuana plants. Federal agents conducted a raid and confiscated 1,962 plants and 200 pounds of marijuana.
