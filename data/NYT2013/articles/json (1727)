{"headline": "On Reed-Thin Evidence, a Very Wide Net of Police Surveillance", "body": "\nA bicycle glides through the perpetual neon glow that suffuses Times Square to the foot of a military recruiting station. The rider dismounts and then bikes away.         \n\nSeconds later,  \n. It is early morning on March 6, 2008; thankfully no one is hurt.         \n\nThree weeks later, the  \n\u2019s intelligence division filed a secret report claiming to have identified Dennis Christopher Burke, an anarchist, as a bombing suspect.         \n\nTheir evidence stood on the frailest of reeds.         \n\nMr. Burke, that secret report stated, might have posted a link on an anarchist blog, \u201cBombs and Shields,\u201d to a news account of the bombing written by Fox News. The police acknowledged that they were just guessing. Their informers had last linked Mr. Burke to that blog three years earlier.         \n\nThey cast their investigatory gaze further. The secret report asserted that Mr. Burke was a \u201cclose associate\u201d of two leaders in Time\u2019s Up, a peaceable activist group that agitated \u2014 sometimes with civil disobedience \u2014 to create a bicycle-friendly city and to sustain community gardens. Those two men, as well, would fall into the surveillance net.         \n\nIn the course of the next year, an undercover officer flew to New Orleans to attend a left-wing gathering opposing United States trade policy. He took notes on planned demonstrations in support of labor unions and prisoner rights. The police file swelled with names and organizations, none remotely connected to the bombing.         \n\nIt was as if the police intelligence division had cast a stone into a still pond, and watched as the ripples spread outward.         \n\nWe are accustomed to thinking of New York\u2019s police spying and surveillance as a phenomenon afflicting Muslims, just as we are accustomed to thinking of  \n as a problem afflicting male blacks and Latinos. In fact, from the Republican National Convention to bike rides through the city to Occupy Wall Street, police undercover spying is often as omnipresent.         \n\nJethro M. Eisenstein, a lawyer, has tried such cases for years. He notes that by court order such investigations are carefully limited, even in a post-terrorist-attack world.         \n\nHe examined documents relating to this case that were supplied by Matt Apuzzo and Adam Goldman, the Associated Press reporters who won the Pulitzer Prize for their investigation of police spying. The two have written a book on the subject,  \n         \n\nTo Mr. Eisenstein\u2019s view, the police investigation wandered dangerously far afield of legality.         \n\n\u201cThere is still supposed to be some evidence that the person is engaged in or may be engaged in a crime,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are not supposed to investigate protected First Amendment activity.\u201d         \n\nNone of this is to deny reality. We inhabit a dangerous world, and dangerous people would cause us grave harm. Terrible possibility is the daily grist of the intelligence division, which has in fact broken up terrorist plots.         \n\nThe temptation is to step softly in second-guessing police work. On Monday, the department insisted, through a spokesman, that it had \u201cfollowed leads\u201d and that it would \u201chave been derelict\u201d to ignore these. But no known fact backs up these claims, and the toll taken on civic activism, which is as much a part of the fabric of New York as museums and parks, is palpable.         \n\nAfter examining the police reports, I called Bill DiPaola. Your name, I told this soft-spoken early-middle-aged man, appears in these reports \u2014 without a shred of evidence of wrongdoing. He hesitated to talk; he found this news frankly intimidating. He is a guy more happily consumed by planning bicycle repair workshops, bike lanes and running a museum in Alphabet City.         \n\nHe saw fear mushrooming where he hoped to plant a community.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried so hard to stay positive, to stress that we\u2019re running an environmental organization,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the honest answer is that we know the police have spied on us for years.\u201d         \n\nThat is no parrot of paranoia yapping in his ear. In 2005, my colleague, the columnist Jim Dwyer,  \n police surveillance of peaceful bike rides and memorials, and the presence of police provocateurs.         \n\nI reached out to Mr. Burke, who declined to talk. Then I reached another \u201cassociate\u201d of Time\u2019s Up, Brandon Neubauer. An artist and an activist, he left Time\u2019s Up years ago and does not even recall Mr. Burke. \u201cWe all operated always with the sense that we were being surveilled,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter 9/11, there were undercovers everywhere; it was intense.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIt definitely hurt my experience with activism,\u201d he added, \u201cand that was absolutely part of the police strategy.\u201d         \n\nThe sound of silence is democracy\u2019s root getting trampled.
