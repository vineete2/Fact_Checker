{"headline": "Columbia Football\u2019s Dogged Futility", "body": "\nWay uptown, at its gleaming new field house on the northern tip of Manhattan, Columbia is trying to win at football \u2014 really, it is \u2014 even though it may appear otherwise.         \n\nThe Lions are 0-9 going into Saturday\u2019s season finale against Brown. They have been outscored by 354-66. Four times, they have allowed more than 50 points. Twice, they have failed to score any.         \n\nBut that is nothing new. Over the years, Columbia \u2014 at least during football season \u2014 has been known for its crummy teams, including the ones that compiled a 44-game losing streak in the 1980s, once an N.C.A.A. record. In the past 50 years, the Lions have had only three winning seasons. In the past 100 years, only 23.         \n\nColumbia wins at many things \u2014 like baseball, fencing, tennis and cross country \u2014 but for generations it has been unable to solve the football riddle. The program is like a prizefighter who has been on the ropes round after round, head ringing, nose bleeding, eyes swollen shut. Yet it continues to come back for more.         \n\nThe question is, why? It\u2019s not as if it\u2019s easy to be a Lion.         \n\nOptimists or masochists, but probably a little of both, the players rise at about 5 a.m. several days a week, while most of the university is still sleeping. They pull on their clothes. They trudge across campus, past darkened libraries, classrooms and dormitories, to a bus that will take them on a 15-minute ride up the island\u2019s west side for practices that last hours, preparations for games that they generally lose.         \n\nAfterward, they rush back to campus for classes \u2014 bio-microelectromechanical systems, principles of quantitative political research \u2014 at one of the country\u2019s most challenging universities. It is all part of a day\u2019s work for players who consciously joined a long, strong losing tradition and so far have not been able to do anything to change it. The immediate rewards are few.         \n\nThe campus newspaper, The Columbia Spectator, was so sick of the football team\u2019s losses that this week it called for Lee Bollinger, the university\u2019s president, to fire the athletic director, M. Dianne Murphy. But getting rid of Murphy would not be a quick fix, if any fix at all. The players Columbia wants to recruit come from the same pool of athletes who consider places like Harvard, Princeton and Yale, where you don\u2019t need a long bus ride to get to practice.         \n\nBut Columbia is, as they say, giving it the old college try. It built a $50 million athletic facility near the stadium. It hired Bollinger, who came from the University of Michigan, where he certainly learned the karmic and fund-raising value of winning sports programs. It brought in Murphy, who built a foundation for national championship contenders at the University of Denver. And every year, new players arrive, thinking that they \u2014 like thousands of players before them \u2014 will be the ones to turn things around.         \n\nBut really, though, should turning the program around be the priority? There\u2019s a good reason students bother playing for an athletic program that has such a history of losing, and why the university continues to generously fund a team mostly known for its failures.         \n\nI should know. I was a member of the rowing team at Columbia for three years, certainly not for the joy of working out on the dirty Harlem River before sunrise, and certainly not to be a part of a winning program, which women\u2019s crew was not at the time.         \n\nNick Melka, a political science major and a defensive lineman on this year\u2019s football team, can explain it. Melka\u2019s teams have lost 31 of their 39 games, but he said they continue to be obsessed with winning. Turning in his powder blue uniform has not once crossed his mind.         \n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t quit on any of my teammates because we\u2019re all struggling together; none of us are quitters,\u201d he said, adding that there was value in losing. \u201cIf we give our word to a company or a job, we\u2019re going to follow through.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/23/sports/ncaafootball/columbia-footballs-dogged-futility.html", "date": "2013-11-22", "description": "Columbia, 0-9 going into Saturday\u2019s season finale against Brown, wins at many things, but for generations it has been unable to solve the football riddle."}
