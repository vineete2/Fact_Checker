{"headline": "The Stories That Bind Us", "body": "\nI hit the breaking point as a parent a few years ago. It was the week of my extended family\u2019s annual gathering in August, and we were struggling with assorted crises. My parents were aging; my wife and I were straining under the chaos of young children; my sister was bracing to prepare her preteens for bullying, sex and cyberstalking.         \n\nSure enough, one night all the tensions boiled over. At dinner, I noticed my nephew texting under the table. I knew I shouldn\u2019t say anything, but I couldn\u2019t help myself and asked him to stop.         \n\nKa-boom! My sister snapped at me to not discipline her child. My dad pointed out that my girls were the ones balancing spoons on their noses. My mom said none of the grandchildren had manners. Within minutes, everyone had fled to separate corners.         \n\nLater, my dad called me to his bedside. There was a palpable sense of fear I couldn\u2019t remember hearing before.         \n\n\u201cOur family\u2019s falling apart,\u201d he said.         \n\n\u201cNo it\u2019s not,\u201d I said instinctively. \u201cIt\u2019s stronger than ever.\u201d         \n\nBut lying in bed afterward, I began to wonder: Was he right? What is the secret sauce that holds a family together? What are the ingredients that make some families effective, resilient, happy?         \n\nIt turns out to be an astonishingly good time to ask that question. The last few years have seen stunning breakthroughs in knowledge about how to make families, along with other groups, work more effectively.         \n\nMyth-shattering research has reshaped our understanding of dinnertime, discipline and difficult conversations. Trendsetting programs from Silicon Valley and the military have introduced techniques for making teams function better.         \n\nThe only problem: most of that knowledge remains ghettoized in these subcultures, hidden from the parents who need it most. I spent the last few years trying to uncover that information, meeting families, scholars and experts ranging from peace negotiators to online game designers to Warren Buffett\u2019s bankers.         \n\nAfter a while, a surprising theme emerged. The single most important thing you can do for your family may be the simplest of all: develop a strong family narrative.         \n\nI first heard this idea from Marshall Duke, a colorful psychologist at  \n. In the mid-1990s, Dr. Duke was asked to help explore myth and ritual in American families.         \n\n\u201cThere was a lot of research at the time into the dissipation of the family,\u201d he told me at his home in suburban Atlanta. \u201cBut we were more interested in what families could do to counteract those forces.\u201d         \n\nAround that time, Dr. Duke\u2019s wife, Sara, a psychologist who works with children with learning disabilities, noticed something about her students.         \n\n\u201cThe ones who know a lot about their families tend to do better when they face challenges,\u201d she said.         \n\nHer husband was intrigued, and along with a colleague, Robyn Fivush, set out to test her hypothesis. They developed a measure called the \u201cDo You Know?\u201d scale that asked children to answer 20 questions.         \n\nExamples included: Do you know where your grandparents grew up? Do you know where your mom and dad went to high school? Do you know where your parents met? Do you know an illness or something really terrible that happened in your family? Do you know the story of your birth?         \n\nDr. Duke and Dr. Fivush asked those questions of four dozen families in the summer of 2001, and taped several of their dinner table conversations. They then compared the children\u2019s results to a battery of psychological tests the children had taken, and reached an overwhelming conclusion. The more children knew about their family\u2019s history, the stronger their sense of control over their lives, the higher their self-esteem and the more successfully they believed their families functioned. The \u201cDo You Know?\u201d scale turned out to be the best single predictor of children\u2019s emotional health and happiness.         \n\n\u201cWe were blown away,\u201d Dr. Duke said.         \n\nAnd then something unexpected happened. Two months later was Sept. 11. As citizens, Dr. Duke and Dr. Fivush were horrified like everyone else, but as psychologists, they knew they had been given a rare opportunity: though the families they studied had not been directly affected by the events, all the children had experienced the same national trauma at the same time. The researchers went back and reassessed the children.         \n\n\u201cOnce again,\u201d Dr. Duke said, \u201cthe ones who knew more about their families proved to be more resilient, meaning they could moderate the effects of stress.\u201d         \n\nWhy does knowing where your grandmother went to school help a child overcome something as minor as a skinned knee or as major as a terrorist attack?         \n\n\u201cThe answers have to do with a child\u2019s sense of being part of a larger family,\u201d Dr. Duke said.         \n\nPsychologists have found that every family has a unifying narrative, he explained, and those narratives take one of three shapes.
