{"headline": "Newtown Killer\u2019s Obsessions, in Chilling Detail", "body": "\nInside the rambling, pale-yellow Colonial-style home in a Connecticut suburb,  \n lived amid a stockpile of disparate weaponry and macabre keepsakes: several firearms, more than 1,600 rounds of ammunition, 11 knives, a starter pistol, a bayonet, 3 samurai swords. He saved photographs of what appeared to be a corpse smeared in blood and covered in plastic, as well as a newspaper clipping that chronicled a vicious shooting at Northern Illinois University.         \n\nA gun safe was in what investigators believed was his bedroom. Among his clothing was a military-style uniform. There was also a holiday card that contained a check made out to Mr. Lanza, 20, and signed by his mother. Investigators suggested that the money had been intended to buy a gun.         \n\nThe disturbing details of Mr. Lanza\u2019s possessions were disclosed on Thursday for the first time since he carried out the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in  \n, one of the deadliest school shootings in the nation\u2019s history. The information was included in  \n connected to the investigation into the  \n, when he killed 20 first graders, 6 educators, his mother and himself.         \n\nThe inventory of the house, combined with interviews conducted over several weeks with law-enforcement officials and people who crossed paths with the Lanza family, afford a somewhat fuller picture of the dark corners of Mr. Lanza\u2019s mind.         \n\nThe interviews revealed that his mother, Nancy Lanza, confided to friends several years ago that her son, who classmates said had been found to have a type of autism, was faring poorly and being bullied in high school. More recently, he had cocooned himself in front of electronic game consoles in the basement of their home, playing warfare games.         \n\nThe contents of the Lanza house are of intense interest because the lives of the family have been picked apart since the shootings, often yielding little insight. A clear understanding of Adam Lanza\u2019s thinking and the texture of his relationship with his mother and others has yet to emerge. What pushed him to his brutality may never be discovered.         \n\nAfter killing his mother at their home on the morning of Dec. 14, Mr. Lanza drove to the grade school that he once attended and carried out the massacre in less than five minutes, according to the search warrant.         \n\nThe rampage brought the nation and the world to tears and touched off a continuing national debate over gun control.         \n\nStephen J. Sedensky III, the state\u2019s attorney who is in charge of the investigation, said in a statement on Thursday that Mr. Lanza shot his mother in the forehead with a .22-caliber rifle while she was in bed in her second-story bedroom.         \n\nAt the school, he used a  \n semiautomatic rifle to fire 154 shots, the statement said. The police also found 10 30-round magazines for the gun, many of them partly or fully emptied.         \n\nMr. Lanza also carried two semiautomatic handguns, one of which he used to kill himself. The police found a 12-gauge shotgun in the car he drove to the school.         \n\nThe inventories attached to the warrants delineated pertinent items found by police in the home that Mr. Lanza shared with his mother, a two-story house with dark green shutters at 36 Yogananda Street in Newtown. Ms. Lanza  \n who often took her son to shooting ranges. She was divorced from his father, Peter Lanza, a General Electric executive.         \n\nThe items included more than 1,600 rounds of ammunition bullets, some of them housed in a Planters peanut can and a Nike shoe box, and an array of weapons found in a brown safe and in bedroom closets. The lists mention four guns, including the shotgun found in the black Honda Civic that Mr. Lanza drove to Sandy Hook, and 70 shotgun shells found in the car. There were two rifles, including the one used to kill Nancy Lanza, as well as a BB gun and a starter pistol.         \n\nThe police also found a certificate from the  \n bearing the name Adam Lanza. The type of certificate was not clear. The organization said on Thursday that Adam Lanza and Nancy Lanza were not members.         \n\nThere was also a receipt from a shooting range in Oklahoma, an N.R.A. guide to the basics of pistol shooting and training manuals on the use of a variety of firearms, including a Bushmaster.         \n\nThere were paper and cardboard gun targets, as well as a considerable amount of computer equipment and game consoles and equipment. There was a hard drive that appeared to have been deliberately smashed.         \n\nThere were numerous books connected to autism. One was titled, \u201cBorn on a Blue Day \u2014 Inside the Mind of an Autistic Savant.\u201d         \n\nClassmates of Mr. Lanza and others who knew the family have said he had an autism variant known as  \n, though investigators have never confirmed that diagnosis. Even so, his association with the disorder has raised alarms among parents of children with the diagnosis, who have expressed concerns that the public might believe that those with autism are prone to violence.
