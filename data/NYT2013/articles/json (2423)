{"headline": "Beckham, at 38, Says He\u2019ll Bend It No Longer", "body": "\nWhen David Beckham broke a bone in his left foot before the 2002 World Cup, Tony Blair, then the British prime minister, interrupted a cabinet meeting to express his concern about England\u2019s suddenly uncertain chances. Tabloid newspapers ran photos of Beckham\u2019s injured foot on Page 1 and asked readers to lay their hands on the picture in an attempt at mass civic healing.         \n\nOn Thursday, Beckham, never the best player in the world but unsurpassed in his era as a cultural phenomenon, announced his impending retirement from soccer at 38.         \n\nThe sport has long had global stars, but none whose careers emerged so fortuitously at the nexus of technology, reality television and celebrity culture. Beckham was the athlete with the most crossover appeal at the moment when everyone could watch together, online or via satellite.         \n\nBeckham was not merely an athlete; he was an international brand that smartly fused a handsomeness that bordered on beauty with athleticism, marketing savvy and an eager embrace of the role of pop idol.         \n\nHe was as likely to appear in Vogue as in Sports Illustrated. He was as popular appearing in underwear advertisements as in a soccer uniform. He was appreciated by working-class fans and was also an icon to gay fans. His wife was a member of the  \n, and his precise passes and curling free kicks inspired a film, \u201c \n,\u201d serving as a metaphor for triumph over social restriction.         \n\n\u201cDavid Beckham is soccer plus sex; those are the only two things that sell in the world, aren\u2019t they?\u201d said Stefan Szymanski, a British co-author of the book \u201c \n\u201d and a professor of sports management at the University of Michigan.         \n\n\u201cWhat Beckham sold was athleticism or soccer to straight men and sex to women and gay men,\u201d Szymanski said. \u201cHe did that rather spectacularly well. I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s the prettiest player the game has ever had. He\u2019s the Marilyn Monroe of soccer. Everybody would want to be next to David Beckham.\u201d         \n\nDespite his looks and talent and adulation, Beckham was not a prima donna on the field. He was considered to have given everything for his club teams and the England national team, winning titles with some of the world\u2019s most popular clubs, Manchester United of England\u2019s Premier League, Real Madrid of Spain\u2019s La Liga and Paris St.-Germain of France\u2019s Ligue 1 (he has two more matches with Paris St.-Germain).         \n\nHis name and reputation alone brought newfound international respect for professional soccer in the United States during his six seasons and two championships with the Los Angeles Galaxy of Major League Soccer.         \n\nAnd, in the era of the Internet and satellite television, Beckham\u2019s career proved hugely influential in the swelling interest of European soccer in Asia and elsewhere around the globe.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s unfair to say he put M.L.S. on the map,\u201d said Bruce Arena, who coached Beckham to two league titles with the Galaxy. \u201cAnd he\u2019s certainly one of the chief people responsible for worldwide attention of the game. He\u2019s one of the most competitive people I ever coached. As he got to the end of his career, he didn\u2019t have the legs he wanted to have, but he had a bigger heart than anyone on the field.\u201d         \n\nBeckham, who made 115 appearances with the English national team, did have his less felicitous moments. Infamously, he committed an impetuous foul that got him ejected from a 1998 World Cup match against Argentina. And Landon Donovan, the American star and former teammate with the Galaxy, criticized Beckham\u2019s early commitment to M.L.S. in a book entitled \u201c \n\u201d by Grant Wahl, a senior writer at Sports Illustrated.         \n\nStill, Beckham\u2019s global appeal went undiminished.         \n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s the most famous athlete in the world,\u201d Wahl said. While a similar claim could be made about the soccer star Lionel Messi, the Olympic sprinting champion Usain Bolt and the golfer Tiger Woods, Wahl said: \u201cBeckham has a celebrity component the other guys don\u2019t. There\u2019s a multiplier effect. If you play the old game, \u2018How many people on earth recognize this sports star?\u2019 I think Beckham is recognized by more people than anyone else.\u201d         \n\nIn addition to the typical mob scenes in his home country or the cities where he played \u2014 which are standard for soccer stars like Messi of Argentina, Cristiano Ronaldo of Portugal or Neymar of Brazil \u2014 Beckham\u2019s worldwide reach often seemed limitless.         \n\nIn Tokyo, a \n that stood nearly 10 feet tall was featured in a downtown department store after the 2002 World Cup. In Australia, mere speculation that Beckham might be interested in playing in the country\u2019s league prompted wealthy businessmen to consider helping finance what would have surely been an outrageously expensive transfer.
