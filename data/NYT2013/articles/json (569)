{"headline": "Army Kills 51, Deepening Crisis in Egypt", "body": "\nCAIRO \u2014 The mass shooting of Islamist protesters by security forces on Monday at a sit-in for Mohamed Morsi, the ousted president, injected new outrage into the standoff over his removal by Egypt\u2019s top generals, darkening hopes that they might reconcile the polarizing forces that have torn at the fabric of the country.         \n\nIt was by far the deadliest day of violence since the revolt that overthrew former President Hosni Mubarak in early 2011. Within a few hours around dawn, advancing soldiers and police officers  \n at least 51 civilians and wounded more than 400, almost all hit by gunfire, health officials said.         \n\nArmy and police spokesmen said that one soldier and two policemen had also been killed. But according to witnesses and video footage, one of the policemen appeared to have been shot by soldiers, and the military provided little evidence to back its claim that the fighting had been instigated by the Islamists.         \n\nThe scale and nature of the killings drove a deeper wedge between Mr. Morsi\u2019s Islamist backers and their opponents, and diminished the chances that his allies in the Muslim Brotherhood might soon be coaxed back into a political process that they deem illegitimate after the military overthrew the elected president.         \n\nAt the same time, the bloodshed sharpened a fierce debate about whether the new military-led interim government that replaced Mr. Morsi last week was moving toward a democracy or away from it. Two and a half years after the overthrow of Mr. Mubarak, the institutions, tactics and dynamics of the decades-old secular-authoritarian government seemed, at least for the moment, to snap back into place.         \n\nSome who vehemently denounced Mr. Mubarak\u2019s use of brute force to silence critics were far more tepid about criticizing the killings of Mr. Morsi\u2019s supporters, calling only for an inquiry to determine the root cause. The United States, which has conspicuously not condemned Mr. Morsi\u2019s ouster, was also mild, calling on security forces to exercise restraint.         \n\n\u201cViolence begets violence and should be strongly condemned,\u201d Mohamed ElBaradei, the former diplomat and liberal leader, said in a statement on  \n. \u201cIndependent investigation is a must.\u201d         \n\nBy contrast, Essam el-Erian, a senior Brotherhood leader, called the killings \u201can outright massacre\u201d by \u201ca fascist coup government.\u201d         \n\nLeaders of the Brotherhood, Egypt\u2019s largest Islamist group and best-organized political force, said the generals had now shown their authoritarian colors, using lethal weapons to crush dissent while holding the freely elected president captive. They called for a national \u201cuprising\u201d against the return of a military dictatorship.         \n\nAl Nour, the only Islamist party that had backed the military\u2019s takeover, suspended its participation in the interim government, accelerating the disintegration of Egyptian politics toward a culture war between Islamists and their foes.         \n\nThe armed forces, on the other hand, claimed that Mr. Morsi\u2019s supporters had attacked them first with rocks, gunfire and army-issued tear gas bombs, though dozens of witnesses \u2014 including some of Mr. Morsi\u2019s opponents \u2014 disputed that account.         \n\nAt a news conference, Ahmed Ali, a military spokesman, said the security forces had responded with rubber bullets and gas bombs after coming under attack by heavy gunfire. He addressed a pointed question about human rights to Western critics: \u201cWhat human rights are there for an armed person who terrorizes citizens and attacks military establishments?\u201d         \n\nThe police, who had never fully accepted Mr. Morsi\u2019s authority, reveled in the day and sought to revise history: a spokesman contended that the Muslim Brotherhood \u2014 and not the police \u2014 had been responsible for killing protesters during the revolt against Mr. Mubarak. \u201cPolicemen never thought that history would speak so quickly to prove the complete innocence of the policemen in the events of the January 2011 revolution,\u201d said the spokesman, Hany Abdel Lateef.         \n\nSome also suggested that Mr. Morsi\u2019s supporters might be to blame for the fighting.         \n\n\u201cWe expect violent actions from the side of the Muslim Brotherhood, and we cannot accept that armed gatherings be labeled as peaceful protests or sit-ins,\u201d Khalid Talima, a representative of the coalition formed around the anti-Morsi protests that preceded his ouster, said at a news conference under the banner \u201cMuslim Brotherhood-American conspiracy against the revolution.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/09/world/middleeast/egypt.html", "date": "2013-07-08", "description": "In a sharp escalation of tensions Monday, Egyptian soldiers opened fire on hundreds of supporters of Mohamed Morsi, the ousted president, witnesses said.
