{"headline": "Three Justices Bound by Beliefs, Not Just Gender", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 You can tell a lot about the Supreme Court by looking at who voted with whom. There are 36 possible pairs of justices, and in the term just concluded something interesting happened.         \n\nThe top three spots were all taken by pairs of women. However you matched them up, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan voted together at least 93 percent of the time.         \n\nThe alignments are a product of ideology, not biology. \u201cThey are the three most liberal justices on the court, and it makes sense that they would often be in agreement,\u201d said  \n, an adviser to the Supreme Court Institute at Georgetown\u2019s law school.         \n\nThe voting pattern highlighted the rightward drift of the fourth member of the court\u2019s liberal wing, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who broke from his usual allies in a series of important privacy cases.         \n\nIn past years, it was often the conservative justices who voted together the most: Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., say, or Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. This year, the right was more fractured. (The statistics come from  \n, and the trends hold whether you look at all cases or just divided ones.)         \n\nThe three female justices also dominated Supreme Court arguments in the last term. Justice Ginsburg asked the first question 37 percent of the time. Justice Sotomayor asked the most questions, averaging more than 21 in each hourlong argument.         \n\nJustice Kagan, a former dean of Harvard Law School and a former United States solicitor general, by many accounts asked the best questions of any of the justices. They were crisp and conversational and probed the heart of the case.         \n\nThe spotlight often captured Justice Sotomayor this term, as her best-selling memoir gave rise to a book tour that drew adoring crowds. She was profiled on \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d talked with Oprah Winfrey and Jon Stewart, and visited \u201cSesame Street\u201d and \u201cThe View.\u201d         \n\nLawyers who appear before her say she is a source of inspiration.         \n\n\u201cI think she has come into her own and is establishing herself as a formidable and independent presence,\u201d said  \n, a lawyer with Arnold & Porter in Washington who has argued 33 cases before the court and served as a law clerk to Justice Ginsburg. \u201cLike the other two women, she\u2019s very comfortable up there, and that\u2019s a great thing for a woman like me to see.\u201d         \n\nAsked by e-mail for an assessment of Justice Sotomayor, a normally sober political scientist did not stint on her exclamation points.         \n\n\u201cPeople love her!\u201d wrote  \n, who teaches at the University of Southern California. \u201cShe made a lot of money!\u201d         \n\nJustice Sotomayor\u2019s financial disclosure forms show that she has received more than $3 million for the book.         \n\nJustice Ginsburg\u2019s form for last year also contained an interesting disclosure. In November, she accepted an \u201caward recipient gift bag\u201d worth $2,500 \u2014 a swag bag, in the lingo \u2014 when she received Glamour magazine\u2019s Woman of the Year Lifetime Achievement Award.         \n\nIn their day jobs, the votes of the three justices are neither wholly predictable nor wholly united, said  \n, a law professor at Drexel University.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to note that the agreement was not on \u2018women\u2019s\u2019 or \u2018social justice\u2019 issues,\u201d she said.         \n\nThe female justices were divided in two of the term\u2019s biggest cases, Professor McElroy added. Justice Sotomayor wanted to provide an answer to whether there is a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, while the other two women said the court was powerless to decide the question in the context of  \n on the practice.         \n\nJustices Ginsburg and Sotomayor also split on affirmative action, with Justice Ginsburg filing the lone dissent in a case that sent  \n plan back to the lower courts for a second look under a more demanding standard. (Justice Kagan, who worked on the case as solicitor general, recused herself.)         \n\nStill, said  \n, the dean of the law school at University of California, Irvine, \u201cthey are the three most liberal justices on the court, and so it is not surprising given their ideological similarity that they vote together the most.\u201d         \n\nJustice Breyer, the next most liberal justice, voted with conservative justices in a decision  \n and in dissents from rulings limiting  \n and  \n.         \n\nIn all three cases, he and Justice Scalia traded places, with Justice Scalia joining the three women in pressing for broad Fourth Amendment protections.         \n\n\u201cI ought to be the pinup of the criminal defense bar,\u201d Justice Scalia  \n at the University of Wyoming in October. He had been hunting in Wyoming, with Justice Kagan.         \n\nJustice Scalia described their trip in  \n in February with Nina Totenberg at George Washington University.         \n\n\u201cIt was, unfortunately, not successful,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got antelope tags, which are expensive for out of state, and mule deer tags. Didn\u2019t get a single shot at an antelope or a mule deer. So she ended up killing a white-tailed doe, which she could have done in my driveway.\u201d         \n\n\u201cShe dropped that doe with one shot,\u201d he said of Justice Kagan\u2019s exercise of her Second Amendment rights. \u201cBoom. Just like that.\u201d         \n\nJustice Scalia is also close to Justice Ginsburg, but there are limits to their friendship. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine Ruth hunting,\u201d he said.
