{"headline": "Application Upload: Your Voice via Video", "body": "\nIN 2009, Tufts and George Mason University opened the multimedia floodgates by inviting applicants to submit videos. While few admissions offices have followed suit and added a video solicitation, a sweep through YouTube shows videos, from existential mulling to absurdist displays of multitasking, being made for a wide swath of institutions. The incentive is clear for students who express themselves best via multimedia, and who isn\u2019t looking for an edge?         \n\nAccording to the new  \n \u201cHow to Make a Winning College Application Video Essay,\u201d a video is an \u201copportunity to step out of the codified, qualified background of your transcript into the foreground.\u201d Percy Angress and Livia Linden, filmmakers who wrote the guide (under the pseudonyms Max Kiefer and Rosa Wolfe), scoured YouTube to help their son and daughter make videos for their own applications, and included the best of what they saw in their book, along with technical and creative advice. To Mr. Angress, who produced special visual effects for \u201cSpaceballs,\u201d submitting a video is a win-win. The worst that could happen? \u201cAdmissions doesn\u2019t view your video,\u201d he said.         \n\nBut what happens when they do? How do admissions deans assess videos? (And, sorry, you still have to write an essay.)         \n\n\u201cThey are evaluated like any submission: creativity, thoughtfulness, voice,\u201d said Lee Coffin, dean of undergraduate admissions at Tufts. \u201cLike an excellent written essay, the best videos showcase a student\u2019s voice.\u201d Tufts has widened its scope. This year, students can respond to a Virginia Woolf quotation via the platform of their choice: video, prose, blog, digital portfolio, slam poetry.         \nAtreyo Sinha, applying to Tufts University fall 2013 \n\nGeorge Mason applicants can explain \u201cwhy Mason is the perfect match for you\u201d via video. \u201cFor us, a video is another way to know if it\u2019s a right fit,\u201d said Amy Takayama-P\u00e9rez, its admissions dean. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to replace your transcript.\u201d Similarly: \u201cIf I had a bad video, is that going to be somebody I don\u2019t take? No.\" Under 5 percent of the George Mason pool submits videos, the same as at Tufts.         \n\nThe College of William & Mary gets videos on occasion, too. \u201cWe get a lot of things we don\u2019t ask for, like shoes \u2014 to get their foot in the door,\u201d said Henry R. Broaddus, associate provost for enrollment and dean of admission. He acknowledges that \u201ca supplemental video might influence applications on the borderline\u201d but firmly refuses to solicit videos because, he says, writing is the essential college-going skill, because a video posted on YouTube invites public comment, and because bright introverts might be put off.         \n\nJoseph Whitesman is clearly not shy in the  \nhe made for New College of Florida. He wanted to underscore his \u201csomewhat goofy interest\u201d in collecting and analyzing data at the county level. He composed a ditty listing Florida\u2019s 67 counties, and ended by doing loopy gymnastics around his yard.         \nJoseph Whitesman, applying to New College of Florida fall 2013 \n\nSonia Wu, the chairwoman of the admissions committee, shares her reaction:  \nNew College has a reputation as a home for creative, independent thinkers. So of course we loved that he wanted to serenade us with the 67 counties of Florida. The truth? Nerdiness is pretty easy to discern just from the essay and the academic record. We would have admitted Joey without the video.\u201d         \n\n\u2022         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n Live action or animation, talent displays or a-day-in-the-life, whimsical raps or messages from the heart? Or, invent a new genre.         \n\n \n Admissions officers are drowning in a deluge of applications. Don\u2019t give them an excuse to click \u201cstop.\u201d Keep it under two minutes (Tufts asks for one minute).         \n\n \nFind an idiosyncratic way to say something authentic about how you see the world. That\u2019s what colleges seek in the mountains of admissions data: the beating heart of a real person.         \n\n \n Write a one-sentence description of your video and why it matters, especially if the college does not specifically invite video essays.         \nKyle Sanford, applying to Massachusetts Institute of Technology fall 2013 \n\n \n         \n\n \n The best videos have a unifying idea and point of view. They\u2019re not a parade of extracurricular activities.         \n\n \n Scoring baby pictures prom snapshots and soccer highlights will delight only Aunt Lucille. Enhance feel-good photos with voice-over or text that augments your application story. Lots of students write songs about the school. Be sure they catch your clever lines. Subtitle lyrics.         \n\n \n Keep pleasantries \u2014 \u201cI made this for you, dear admissions officer,\u201d \u201cSee you in the fall!\u201d \u2014 to a minimum.         \n\n \n Lees-McRae College in North Carolina, which awards a scholarship to the admitted student with the best video, advises: \u201cConsider working within a creative limit, such as not showing your face or using only written text. Try to avoid simply recording yourself talking.\u201d         \nMelissa Hooper, applying to Lees-McRae College (N.C.) fall 2013", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/education/edlife/application-upload-your-voice-via-video.html", "date": "2013-11-01", "description": "Some students express themselves best via multimedia, so they are making videos to go with their applications.
