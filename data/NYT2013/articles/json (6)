{"headline": "George Saunders Has Written the Best Book You\u2019ll Read This Year", "body": "\nIn a little sushi restaurant in Syracuse, George Saunders conceded that, sure, one reality was that he and I were a couple guys talking fiction and eating avocado salad and listening to Alanis Morissette coming from the speaker above our heads. Another was that we were walking corpses. We\u2019d been on the subject of death for a while. A friend I loved very much died recently, and I was trying to describe the state I sometimes still found myself in \u2014 not quite of this world, but each day a little less removed \u2014 and how I knew it was a good thing, the re-entry, but I regretted it too, because it meant the dimming of a kind of awareness that doesn\u2019t get lit up very much. I was having some trouble articulating it, but Saunders was right there, leaning in and encouraging. He has a bushy blond mustache and goatee going gray, and sometimes, when he\u2019s listening intently, he can look a little stern, as if he just stepped out of a tent at Antietam. But then he starts talking and the eyebrows go up and it\u2019s all Chicago vowels and twinkly Doug Henning eyes, and if you didn\u2019t know that he was more or less universally regarded as a genius, you might peg him as the superfriendly host of a woodworking show on daytime public access.         \n\n\u201cIt would be so interesting if we could stay like that,\u201d Saunders said, meaning: if we could conduct our lives with the kind of openness that sometimes comes with proximity to death. He described a flight from Chicago to Syracuse that he was on a little over 10 years ago. \u201cWe were flying along, and I\u2019ve got a guilty pleasure \u2014 I\u2019m reading Vanity Fair \u2014 and I\u2019m on my way home. And suddenly there\u2019s this crazy sound, like a minivan hit the side of the plane. And I thought, Uh, oh, I\u2019m not even gonna look up. If I don\u2019t look up from the magazine, it\u2019s not happening. And then it happened again.\u201d         \n\nEveryone starts screaming, the plane is making terrible metal-in-distress sounds. Black smoke \u2014 \u201cblack like in a Batman movie\u201d \u2014 starts streaming out of the fresh-air nozzles overhead. They turn back toward O\u2019Hare, \u201cand there\u2019s that grid of Chicago, and I\u2019m seeing it coming up really fast.\u201d The lights flicker, and the pilot comes on and tells everyone, with panic in his voice, to stay buckled. \u201cAnd there\u2019s this little 14-year-old boy next to me. He turns to me and says, \u2018Sir, is this supposed to be happening?\u2019         \n\n\u201cAnd I remember thinking, No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Just that one syllable, over and over. And also thinking, You could actually piss yourself. And the strongest thing was the sense of that seat right there.\u201d He pointed toward the imaginary seat back in front of him. \u201cI thought, Oh, yeah, this body. I\u2019ve had it all this time, and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to do it. That right there.\u201d He had assumed that if he was ever faced with death, he would \u201chandle it with aplomb,\u201d he would be present in the moment, he would make peace in the time he had left. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t even remember my own name,\u201d he said. \u201cI was so completely not present. I was just the word no.\u201d         \n\nEventually he managed to turn to the kid next to him and say that it was going to be O.K., \u201cthough I didn\u2019t think so. And there was a woman across the aisle. And finally \u2014 it was like coming out of a deep freeze \u2014 I could just reach over, and I took her hand.\u201d That\u2019s how they remained for the next several minutes, waiting to die.         \n\nIn the end, they didn\u2019t crash into the Chicago streets or plunge into the freezing lake but made it safely to the runway, where all the emergency-response equipment was in place but not needed. It turned out, in a detail that could have been lifted from a George Saunders story, they all nearly died because the plane had flown into a flock of geese.         \n\n\u201cFor three or four days after that,\u201d he said, \u201cit was the most beautiful world. To have gotten back in it, you know? And I thought, If you could walk around like that all the time, to really have that awareness that it\u2019s actually going to end. That\u2019s the trick.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/magazine/george-saunders-just-wrote-the-best-book-youll-read-this-year.html", "date": "2013-01-03", "description": "The brutal, beautiful vision of a great American storyteller."}
