{"headline": "What Pet Owners Must Do to Get New York Apartments", "body": "\nIn a seemingly endless game of cat-and-mouse, pet owners do many things to ease their way into the apartment of their dreams \u2014 legitimate and not so.         \n\nThey offer to pay large sums in advance to cover the potential cost of refinishing scratched floors or replacing damaged lobby carpet. Owners of large dogs fudge a pet\u2019s weight (always downward) and the breed. Owners of several black cats will admit to having just one, on the theory that all black cats look the same.         \n\nIn a building that has abruptly adopted a no-pet policy, a dog that has died may be replaced by another of the identical breed that mysteriously answers to the dead dog\u2019s name. Increasingly, pet owners seeking apartments are being asked to submit fat dossiers containing reports from veterinarians, dog walkers, neighbors and rescue services detailing their pet\u2019s sweet nature and nondestructive tendencies. Some owners have been known to sedate their dogs in preparation for the increasingly required interview before a co-op board.         \n\nThese strategies may seem surprising, because in many respects, New York pet owners have much to be thankful for.         \n\nIn 1983 the city passed a law allowing residents in most New York apartments that don\u2019t allow pets to keep a pet if it hasn\u2019t been concealed over a three-month period and no lawsuit has been filed during that time.         \n\nExpanding legal protection for people with physical and emotional disabilities, along with growing awareness of the therapeutic value of pets generally, has also done much to benefit pet owners. As such, the situation is far from the 1960s and \u201970s, when leases for rent-regulated apartments routinely included the clause \u201cno pets allowed.\u201d         \n\nNonetheless, pet owners, especially those with large and less-than-beloved breeds of dog, say it has become ever harder to find a welcoming apartment.         \n\nEven when a building advertises itself as \u201cpet-friendly,\u201d there is no guarantee that a particular pet will be a shoo-in. Condominiums that permit animals may prohibit subrenters with pets. Many pet-friendly co-ops and rental buildings impose restrictions regarding number, size and breed. And since many people are devoted to certain breeds, choosing one half the size is rarely an acceptable compromise.         \n\nEconomic pressures aggravate the situation. As Paul Buttenhoff, a director of sales and leasing at Platinum Properties, a residential brokerage, put it, tongue only slightly in cheek: \u201cIn the winter of 2008-2009, when the market was in free-fall, you could basically move a dinosaur into your apartment because many landlords were desperate to fill vacancies. But when the market heats up, landlords can afford to be more choosy.\u201d And right now, the rental and sales markets are very tight.         \n\nOn occasion, would-be pet owners try to game the laws protecting people with disabilities. Many Americans, of course, suffer from legitimate physical and emotional ailments that are eased by the presence of an animal. But observers of the city\u2019s real estate world agree that growing litigation on this front includes healthy people seeking to use this route to keep an animal under their roof.         \n\n\u201cFor example,\u201d said Sherwin Belkin, a partner of Belkin Burden Wenig & Goldman, whose specialty is rental buildings, \u201cthey\u2019ll submit a letter on plain paper, not letterhead, that says little more than, \u2018This person feels depressed, and a dog will make her feel good.\u2019 A letter like that generally won\u2019t cut it.\u201d His colleague Aaron Shmulewitz, who represents co-ops and condos, added: \u201cThe norm is restriction, especially with large dogs and with breeds like Dobermans and Rottweilers. New buildings tout their pet-friendliness, but board approval is generally required for more than two animals.\u201d         \n\nDarryl Vernon, a former member of the committee on animal law of the New York City Bar Association, wrote \u201cCompanion Animals in  \n Apartments,\u201d the committee\u2019s brochure on pets in housing. \u201cWith co-ops and condos, the situation is getting better, but boards enforce what they want to enforce,\u201d he said. \u201cEven many buildings that describe themselves as pet-friendly impose myriad restrictions.\u201d The issues generally involve dogs because, as Mr. Vernon said, \u201clandlords tend not to know about cats, so there\u2019s less litigation.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/31/realestate/what-pet-owners-must-do-to-get-new-york-apartments.html", "date": "2013-03-29", "description": "New Yorkers will jump through all kinds of hoops, and even play a few tricks, in order to share a home with a beloved pet."}
