{"headline": "New York City Marathon to Have Tighter Security", "body": "\nAll bags brought anywhere near the New York City Marathon will be searched. Family members heading to the finish line will go through a special screening. People marching in the kickoff parade will not be allowed to carry bags of any kind.         \n\nThose are just some of the security restrictions New York\u2019s marathon organizers are taking in the wake of the  \n as they work to ensure the safety of next month\u2019s race, the biggest in the country.         \n\n\u201cSafety is always the first priority with the marathon,\u201d said Mary Wittenberg, the chief executive of New York Road Runners. \u201cI think we\u2019ve found a new normal coming after Boston.\u201d         \n\nMuch as the airline industry revamped its procedures after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, race organizers are overhauling their approach to road racing security.         \n\nAlmost immediately after the Boston bombings in April, Wittenberg consulted with Raymond W. Kelly, the commissioner of the New York City Police Department. Her organization hired an international private security firm, MSA Security, to conduct \u201ca top-to-bottom analysis\u201d of the organization\u2019s existing security plan, she said.         \n\nThe security firm gave marathon organizers \u201ca pretty good report card,\u201d said Peter Ciaccia, an executive vice president of Road Runners. But as a result of the analysis, marathon organizers are trying to seal off more areas, perhaps most notably at the family reunion area, where new bag checks will be installed along Central Park West, Ciaccia said.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to create a police state,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a great day, a celebration.\u201d         \n\nOther security elements will include clear plastic bags used to store goods; an expansion of baggage inspection areas at the race\u2019s start on Staten Island; special screenings for visitors to the family reunion area; and an increase of assigned police officers, uniformed and undercover.         \n\nA police spokeswoman declined to comment on the department\u2019s security plans for the race other than to say, \u201cWe review our security measures on a day-to-day basis.\u201d         \n\nAnthony C. Roman, a fraud and security expert with Roman & Associates, said he expected the Police Department to use some combination of its extensive counterterrorism tools: scuba divers, helicopters, video surveillance programs, intelligence relationships with federal agencies and bomb-sniffing dogs, to name a few.         \n\n\u201cThe resources being brought to bear on this are remarkable,\u201d Roman said.         \n\nMarathons have long posed security challenges. While the N.F.L. can seal off stadiums, the paradelike, sprawling layout of a marathon that winds through the city\u2019s five boroughs creates a security headache.         \n\nLast year\u2019s race was canceled because of Hurricane Sandy. \u201cI think the overwhelming thing we\u2019ve heard from runners is that they want this event to go on,\u201d Wittenberg said.         \n\nRunners at the starting line at Fort Wadsworth on Staten Island will be screened in the organization\u2019s database, as will any volunteers or contractors involved with the operation of the marathon.         \n\nThe security situation will be on the minds of many runners.         \n\nIbra Morales, a runner who lives on the Upper West Side, ran in the Boston Marathon this year, only to be stopped at Mile 26 when the bombs went off. This fall, he will attempt to run the New York City Marathon, a race he has completed more than 30 times.         \n\nBut with the Boston blasts taken into consideration, he plans to run in the middle of the road this year.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anything will happen,\u201d Morales said. \u201cBut you have to be alert. I will not run with fear.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/04/sports/organizers-overhaul-security-plan-for-marathon.html", "date": "2013-10-03", "description": "Runners and their family members can expect more searches, screenings and sealed-off areas at the New York City Marathon this year."}
