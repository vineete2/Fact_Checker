{"headline": "Athletes in Sochi to Be Barred From Advocating Gay Causes ", "body": "\nMOSCOW \u2014 Russia\u2019s minister of sports, Vitaly L. Mutko, said on Thursday that foreign athletes traveling to Russia for the 2014 Olympics in Sochi would be expected to obey a new Russian law banning \u201chomosexual propaganda\u201d or face criminal prosecution.         \n\nIn comments made to the state news agency R-Sport, Mutko said that gay athletes were welcome to attend the Games, but insisted that under the new law no athlete or visitor could advocate a \u201cnontraditional\u201d sexual orientation.         \n\nThe statement seemed sure to stoke criticism of the law, which has already become a point of contention for the Games, with some calls for a boycott. Legislation and statements by the Russian Orthodox Church and political officials about the law have been denounced as homophobic.         \n\n\u201cNo one is forbidding a sportsman with a nontraditional sexual orientation to come to Sochi,\u201d Mutko said. \u201cBut if he goes out on the street and starts to propagandize it, then of course he will be held accountable. Even if he\u2019s a sportsman, when he comes to a country, he should respect its laws.\u201d         \n\nThe law, which Russian President Vladimir V. Putin signed last month, imposes a fine of up to $155 for individuals who advocate \u201cnontraditional\u201d sexual relationships among minors. But the law is so vague that it is widely interpreted here as a broader effort to restrict open advocacy of homosexuality.         \n\nThose who violate the law may be arrested, and foreigners could face deportation.         \n\nThe legislation has provoked anger and a spirited response from gay rights advocates outside Russia.         \n\nOn Wednesday, protesters dumped several cases of vodka outside the Russian consulate in New York while calling for a boycott of the Olympics and sponsors of the Games.         \n\nIn an attempt to head off the controversy last week, the International Olympic Committee said it had \u201creceived assurances from the highest level of government in Russia that the legislation will not affect those attending or taking part in the Games.\u201d         \n\nMutko\u2019s statements, however, seemed to undermine that claim, and might reflect conflicts among senior authorities over how to handle what has become a sensitive issue ahead of an event meant to highlight Russia\u2019s global stature.         \n\nThe Kremlin has pursued an increasingly conservative agenda since Putin\u2019s return to the presidency last year, aligning its politics with the Russian Orthodox Church to pass legislation banning adoptions of children to same-sex couples and criminalizing blasphemy.         \n\nLast month, the leader of the church, Patriarch Kirill I, called the legalization of same-sex marriage a \u201cvery dangerous symptom of the apocalypse.\u201d         \n\nCritics have said the laws promote an antigay bias among Russians, and have pointed to recent killings and brutal attacks against gays as evidence.
