{"headline": "Elections Board Rings In the Old, as Lever Machines Replace Scanners", "body": "\nDented, dinged and dated, New York\u2019s battleship-gray lever voting machines have been hauled out of retirement because the city can\u2019t seem to get the hang of electronic voting.         \n\nAbout 5,100 old machines, each weighing more than 800 pounds and made of 20,000 parts, have been lubricated, and the names of candidates from 2009 (Michael R. Bloomberg, anyone?) have been removed and replaced with those of this year\u2019s contenders.         \n\nBut there is a question no one can answer for sure: Will they work?         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m very nervous about it,\u201d said Councilwoman Gale A. Brewer, who leads a City Council panel that monitors the Board of Elections. Ms. Brewer\u2019s interest is personal as well \u2014 she is one of four candidates in a hotly contested Democratic primary for Manhattan borough president.         \n\nThe lever machines to be used on Tuesday were acquired in the 1960s. In 2010, they were replaced with a $95 million electronic system that uses optical scanners to read paper ballots.         \n\nBut after long lines and chaotic polling scenes in 2012, as well as problems producing complete election results, the State Legislature this year authorized the return of the lever machines for the primary and any ensuing runoff, though it insisted that the city make the electronic machines work for the November general election.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the only solution,\u201d said Michael J. Ryan, who was appointed  \n a month ago, after nearly three years in which the position sat empty.         \n\nMr. Ryan, saying \u201cthe machines have all been tested, and they\u2019re functional,\u201d brushed off criticism of the board\u2019s preparations. \u201cI think that there are naysayers in every walk of life, and some people just like to harp on the darker side of life,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re a lot more optimistic here about this election coming off, and the election coming off successfully.\u201d         \n\nBut on Sunday, Mayor Bloomberg made it clear that he was not optimistic. The city\u2019s elections board is controlled by the local Republican and Democratic Parties, and Mr. Bloomberg has been unable to influence its conduct.         \n\nIn his weekly radio address, the mayor derided \u201can elections bureaucracy rife with patronage, mismanagement, incompetence, and waste,\u201d called the Board of Elections \u201cnotoriously dysfunctional\u201d and said it had a \u201cdismal track record.\u201d He urged residents who have trouble at the polls to call 311 for help.         \n\n\u201cInexplicable delays in reporting election results; misplaced and sometimes dramatically misreported returns; failures to open polling places on time or keep them operating efficiently: The sad litany of past Board of Elections bungles is a long one,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe problems last year \u2014 which occurred during an era when New York has claimed to be a capital of technology by welcoming outposts of Google and Facebook and planning  \n \u2014 were disheartening to advocates of easier voting.         \n\nLast year, it took  \n to determine the winner of a special election for State Senate in Brooklyn, a process delayed by a recount and litigation. Weeks later, a hard-fought Congressional primary in Upper Manhattan and the Bronx was  \n when the board released election night totals that did not include votes from some precincts. As recently as July, the board said it had discovered uncounted ballots cast in last year\u2019s presidential election.         \n\nGovernment watchdog groups and civil rights organizations have a variety of concerns this year. They worry that the lever voting machines, stored under plastic covers in a pair of Brooklyn warehouses and largely forgotten for the past several years, might break down. They fret about the sizable number of poll workers who are familiar only with the optical scanners. And they fear rampant confusion among voters \u2014 on Sunday, the  \n for the Board of Elections still featured the instructions, \u201cVote the New Way,\u201d along with a large photograph of an electronic voting machine, and there was no sample ballot displayed.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really going to be very hard to predict what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d said Kate Doran, the election specialist for the League of Women Voters of the City of New York. \u201cMy own feeling is you\u2019re going to have voters who have never voted on these levers before, you\u2019re going to have poll workers who are poorly trained, and we\u2019ll get machine breakdowns which will send us into a paper-ballot system. That\u2019s the worst case.\u201d         \n\nElections in New York are always complicated, because of the city\u2019s scale and diversity. An advocacy group, LatinoJustice PRLDEF, is concerned about whether there will be enough poll workers who speak Spanish, and whether they will be assigned to the polling places where they are most needed. Another organization, the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund,  \n in July over its failure to make available ballots  \n and has expressed concern about the availability of Chinese and Korean interpreters.         \n\nThe Legislature agreed to let the city use the old lever machines for the primary and runoffs \u2014 which would be held in citywide primaries in which no candidate received 40 percent of the vote \u2014 after legislative leaders were unable to come to an agreement on how to respond to the city\u2019s request to move the primary to June from September, to allow more time for a hand recount of results if needed. But lawmakers decided that the electronic voting machines, bought after Congress required states to upgrade their voting systems to avoid a repeat of the Florida recount in the 2000 presidential election, had to be used in November.
