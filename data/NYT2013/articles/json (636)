Protesters ran through the streets, blocking traffic, hitting cars, assaulting pedestrians and ransacking businesses, the police reported.         \n\nHundreds of police officers in riot gear descended on the area to quell the unrest. Fourteen people were arrested, the police said, half of them juveniles.         \n\nTwo decades after the  \n of white Los Angeles police officers in the beating of Rodney King sparked deadly riots in the same part of the city, residents and public officials agreed that the more muted anger over the Zimmerman verdict \u2014 and the much smaller outbreak of violence \u2014 showed how much, and how little, has changed.         \n\n\u201cTwenty-one years ago we witnessed what could happen when there\u2019s a reaction to a verdict,\u201d Mark Ridley-Thomas, a Los Angeles County supervisor who represents South Los Angeles, said at a news conference on Monday night. \u201cSimilar sentiments are being expressed here in this space, but the response of the L.A.P.D. is qualitatively different.\u201d         \n\nMany in the neighborhood, while remaining wary of law enforcement officials, agreed that relations between black residents and the Police Department had vastly improved. The police allowed the demonstration to continue until the violence began.         \n\n\u201cThe police did a top-notch job,\u201d said Trebien Bellows, 46, a lifelong neighborhood resident. \u201cBefore things got crazy, they jumped right on it.\u201d         \n\nDespite his praise for the police, Mr. Bellows said he understood the frustration expressed by the group that broke away from the protest in outrage. Young black people continue to be perceived as threats and targeted by the police, he said, and the Zimmerman case showed how they often paid with their lives.         \n\n\u201cWhat happened after the peaceful protest was basically just kids lashing out,\u201d he said. \u201cYoung African-American and Latino kids, they\u2019re the ones being targeted.\u201d         \n\nDarnell M. Hunt, a sociology professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studied the 1992 riots, said that five years after the election of the country\u2019s first black president, race relations are at a critical point.         \n\nWhen Barack Obama was elected, he said, crowds gathered in Leimert Park to celebrate. \u201cThey really did see it as a new day in terms of race, and most importantly for black youth, who for generations never seriously thought they could become president,\u201d Dr. Hunt said.         \n\nNow, the same community is protesting instead of celebrating. \u201cPeople were hoping their view of justice would be served, and it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Dr. Hunt said. \u201cThey\u2019re having a hard time believing in the American dream and the idea that African-Americans had finally become full-fledged citizens.\u201d         \n\nAttorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., in a speech Tuesday at the N.A.A.C.P. convention in Orlando, Fla., condemned Florida\u2019s Stand Your Ground law. \u201cIt\u2019s time to question laws that senselessly expand the concept of self-defense and sow dangerous conflict in our neighborhoods,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe unrest in Los Angeles followed consecutive  \n in cities like Atlanta, Chicago, New York and Washington. In Oakland, Calif., demonstrators blocked traffic along Interstate 880 for a brief period during the afternoon rush Monday before authorities cleared the road.         \n\nThe protesters made varied demands. Some wanted the federal government to prosecute Mr. Zimmerman. Others hoped for an overhaul of the entire American justice system.         \n\n\u201cThis is much bigger than just this one trial,\u201d said Oriana Sly, 20, of Los Angeles. She carried a sign that read \u201cJustice for Trayvon\u201d as she marched up Crenshaw Boulevard here on Sunday night. \u201cPeople of color have not received our fair share with the American justice system.\u201d         \n\nOn Monday night, however, some protesters\u2019 frustration boiled over. They stormed a Walmart and other stores. They ran through the streets, blocking traffic and jumping on stopped cars, kicking them and dancing on the hoods. A television news crew was attacked.         \n\nAs the city\u2019s new mayor, Eric Garcetti, called for calm on the streets on Tuesday, he acknowledged the echoes from the Rodney King riots, but insisted the city had come a long way.         \n\n\u201cThis is a different moment in time; we can see how much change for the better the city has enjoyed since 1992,\u201d Mr. Garcetti said. \u201cFor somebody born after 1992, they just see the world the way it is before them. I think the importance of seeing this through the youth\u2019s eyes is to see what\u2019s left undone.\u201d         \n\n\u201cOur work isn\u2019t finished here,\u201d he added. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t finished in 1965. It wasn\u2019t finished in 1992. It is not finished in 2013.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/17/us/los-angeles-protests-zimmerman.html", "date": "2013-07-16", "description": "The Los Angeles police prepared for another night of protests in reaction to George Zimmerman\u2019s acquittal, as leaders called for calm after a demonstration that turned violent."}
