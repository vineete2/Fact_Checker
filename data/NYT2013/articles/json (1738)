{"headline": "Germany\u2019s Effort at Clean Energy Proves Complex", "body": "\nBERLIN \u2014 It is an audacious undertaking with wide and deep support in Germany: shut down the nation\u2019s nuclear power plants, wean the country from coal and promote a wholesale shift to renewable energy sources.         \n\nBut the plan, backed by Chancellor Angela Merkel and opposition parties alike, is running into problems in execution that are forcing Germans to come face to face with the costs and complexities of sticking to their principles.         \n\nGerman families are being hit by rapidly increasing electricity rates, to the point where growing numbers of them can no longer afford to pay the bill. Businesses are more and more worried that their energy costs will put them at a disadvantage to competitors in nations with lower energy costs, and some energy-intensive industries have begun to shun the country because they fear steeper costs ahead.         \n\nNewly constructed offshore wind farms churn unconnected to an energy grid still in need of expansion. And despite all the costs, carbon emissions actually rose last year as reserve coal-burning plants were fired up to close gaps in energy supplies.         \n\nA new phrase, \u201cenergy poverty,\u201d has entered the lexicon.         \n\n\u201cOften, I don\u2019t go into my living room in order to save electricity,\u201d said Olaf Taeuber, 55, who manages a fleet of vehicles for a social services provider in Berlin. \u201cYou feel the pain in your pocketbook.\u201d         \n\nMr. Taeuber relies on just a single five-watt bulb that gives off what he calls a \u201ccozy\u201d glow to light his kitchen when he comes home at night. If in real need, he switches on a neon tube, which uses all of 25 watts.         \n\nEven so, with his bill growing rapidly, he found himself seeking help last week to fend off a threat from Berlin\u2019s main power company to cut off his electricity. He is one of a growing number of Germans confronting the realities of trying to carry out Ms. Merkel\u2019s most ambitious domestic project and one of the most sweeping energy transformation efforts undertaken by an industrialized country.         \n\nBecause the program has the support of German political parties across the spectrum, there has been no highly visible backlash during the current election campaign. But continuing to put the program in place and maintaining public support for it will be among Ms. Merkel\u2019s biggest challenges should she win a third term as chancellor in Sunday\u2019s election.         \n\nMs. Merkel, of the traditionally conservative and pro-business Christian Democrats, came up with her plan in 2011, in the emotional aftermath of the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan. It envisions shutting down all of Germany\u2019s nuclear plants by 2022 and shifting almost entirely to wind and solar power by 2050.         \n\nThe chancellor\u2019s about-face not only seized the energy initiative from her center-left opponents, it also amounted to a gamble that could prove to be her most lasting domestic legacy \u2014 or a debacle whose consequences will be felt for generations.         \n\nThe cost of the plan is expected to be about $735 billion, according to government estimates, and may eventually surpass even that of the euro zone bailouts that have received far more attention during Ms. Merkel\u2019s tenure. Yet as the transition\u2019s unknowns have grown, so have costs for the state, major companies and consumers.         \n\nMr. Taeuber showed up last Friday, one of three \u201cwalk-ins\u201d that day at one of two agencies in Berlin offering aid to people struggling to pay their energy bills. He arrived just as employees from the power company Vattenfall were on the way to his apartment.         \n\nSven G\u00e4rtner, an agency employee, called Vattenfall with the promise of a payment plan, sparing Mr. Taeuber from being disconnected. \u201cThe boys were already in the basement, but they agreed to pull them back,\u201d Mr. G\u00e4rtner said triumphantly.         \n\nSince January, Mr. G\u00e4rtner said, his group has intervened in more than 350 cases to prevent Vattenfall from leaving one family or another in the dark. In the first six months of this year, about 1,800 sought help, 200 more than in all of 2012.
