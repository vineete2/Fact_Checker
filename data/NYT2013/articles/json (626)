{"headline": "Doping Inquiry Has Baseball Playing Tough", "body": "\nMark J. Sullivan worked for the Secret Service for the past 30 years. He was in charge of Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s security detail when she was first lady, and he became the director of the agency for nearly seven years.         \n\nNow Major League Baseball has deployed him in its pursuit of players suspected of doping. His hiring is one of the most notable examples of the tough means the league is using to try to expose some of its biggest stars.         \n\nIn striking contrast to how the league once dealt with performance-enhancing drugs \u2014 it was long derided for turning a blind eye as players bulked up and rewrote the record books \u2014 baseball officials are using unusually tough measures to expose some of the sport\u2019s biggest stars.         \n\nThe Yankees\u2019  \n and Ryan Braun of the Milwaukee Brewers appear to be squarely in the league\u2019s cross hairs. Rodriguez met with league investigators on Friday for their examination into a South Florida anti-aging clinic believed to be a distributor of banned substances.         \n\n\u201cThis is at the top level of aggressive investigations,\u201d said John Hoberman, a University of Texas professor who is an expert on performance-enhancing drugs. \u201cThe leagues and federations historically have been very reluctant to pull out the stops in investigations.\u201d         \n\nIn late January, news reports connected Rodriguez, Braun and several other major leaguers to the clinic, called Biogenesis. The players and the clinic\u2019s director said they had done nothing wrong.         \n\nAt the time, Major League Baseball officials seemed to have little hope in building a doping case against the players. Its drug-testing program had not turned up positive tests on many of the players. The league did not possess any of the clinic\u2019s documents that might incriminate the players. And the league, lacking the power to subpoena witnesses, could not compel anyone involved with the clinic or the players themselves to be forthcoming.         \n\nBut over the past six months, Major League Baseball has engaged in a dogged pursuit of its own stars, a costly doping investigation highly unusual for a professional sports league in the United States. Independent antidoping experts have long criticized the leagues for refusing to enact more rigorous testing protocols.         \n\n\u201cThis investigation is broader, longer, and more expensive than all of the other investigations we\u2019ve done, put together,\u201d said Robert Manfred, an executive vice president with Major League Baseball.         \n\nThe hiring of Sullivan\u2019s services, which began in April, is among the most notable examples of the league\u2019s new tactics. He will advise baseball on how best to conduct the investigation, use his own connections to advance it and help identify potential frailties in their case.         \n\nSullivan, who retired from the Secret Service in February, has extensive experience leading complex inquiries, having overseen criminal investigations during his time at the agency. An executive at GSIS, the firm Sullivan joined after leaving the Secret Service, declined to comment, citing the firm\u2019s policy of not publicly discussing its clients.         \n\nA baseball spokesman confirmed Sullivan\u2019s role as a consultant and added that \u201cbecause of the scope of this investigation, many outside resources and sources of expertise have been utilized.\u201d         \n\nBaseball\u2019s efforts in South Florida, spearheaded by its investigations unit at the direction of Commissioner Bud Selig, have included unusual twists and turns. The unit consists of a group of lawyers and investigators, some of whom have worked for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Agency and the New York Police Department.         \n\nInitially, baseball asked a weekly newspaper, The Miami New Times, to share documents it obtained from a source, linking players to the clinic. When the newspaper declined, baseball began to look elsewhere.         \n\nTo build the case, baseball took the unprecedented step of filing a lawsuit against the clinic and people associated with it, hoping to gain leverage over them and obtain incriminating documents through discovery. It has also paid for documents from the clinic, which was operated by Anthony Bosch, and offered cash to potential informants.         \n\nBaseball has mobilized its investigations unit from New York to Miami, where its agents are going door to door hunting for information that connects players to Bosch\u2019s clinic.         \n\nWitnesses have complained of unconventional, if not overly aggressive, tactics.
