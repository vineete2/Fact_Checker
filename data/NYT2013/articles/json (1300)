{"headline": "Trusts Offer a Legal Loophole for Buying Restricted Guns", "body": "\nA growing number of shooting enthusiasts are creating legal trusts to acquire machine guns, silencers or other items whose sale is restricted by federal law \u2014 a mechanism that bypasses the need to obtain law enforcement approval or even undergo criminal background checks.         \n\nThe trusts, called gun trusts, are intended to allow the owners of the firearms to share them legally with family members and to pass them down responsibly. They have gained in popularity, gun owners say, in part because they may offer protection from future legislation intended to prohibit the possession or sale of the firearms.         \n\nBut because of a loophole in federal regulations, buying restricted firearms through a trust also exempts the trust\u2019s members from requirements that apply to individual buyers, including being fingerprinted, obtaining the approval of a chief local law enforcement officer and undergoing a background check.         \n\nLawyers who handle the trusts and gun owners who have used them say that a majority of customers who buy restricted firearms through trusts do not do so to avoid such requirements. And most gun dealers continue to require background checks for the representative of the trust who picks up the firearm. But not all do.         \n\nChristopher J. Dorner, the former Los Angeles police officer who embarked on a weeklong assault on law enforcement officers this month that  \n on Feb. 12, said in a rambling 11,000-word manifesto that he had used a gun trust to buy silencers and a short-barreled rifle from a gun store in Nevada without a background check.         \n\nReferring to a computer program available from the personal finance software company Quicken, Mr. Dorner wrote, \u201cI was able to use a trust account that I created on quicken will maker and a $10 notary charge at a mailbox etc. to obtain them legally.\u201d Mr. Dorner was not a felon and probably would have passed a background check had he received one.         \n\nMike Campbell, a spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which enforces firearms regulations, said that applications filed with the A.T.F. for transfers of restricted firearms to trusts or corporations have more than doubled in the last four years, to more than 39,000 in 2012 from about 15,000 in 2008. He said the increase was largely attributable to the growth in the number of trusts.         \n\nMr. Campbell confirmed that under current regulations, background checks were not required for the buying of restricted firearms through trusts. The agency, he added, was aware of the loophole and was reviewing changes to close it.         \n\nLawyers who prepare gun trusts said requests for the documents had been increasing in recent months as proposals for gun legislation proliferated in state legislatures and on Capitol Hill. They said some gun owners were even creating trusts for nonrestricted firearms like semiautomatic rifles and pistols, hoping to protect them against the specter of future legislation.         \n\nThe cost of setting up a trust can vary from a small amount for an online form to $100 to $2,500 in lawyers\u2019 fees, depending on location and the type of trust.         \n\nThe sale and possession of silencers, fully automatic guns manufactured before 1986 and other firearms and accessories that fall under the 1934 National Firearms Act are legal in many states. But the A.T.F. keeps a registry of the firearms and must approve their sale, a process that can take several months, and the buyer must pay a $200 tax.         \n\nJ. W. Hagan, a computer administrator in Jacksonville, Fla., said he created a trust to buy silencers, which have become popular for target shooting and hunting and can be owned legally in a growing number of states. He said the trust would ensure that if he died, his firearms would remain legal. The trust would also allow his fianc\u00e9e to use the silencers once the couple married.         \n\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t have a trust, she wouldn\u2019t even be able to have the password for my safe,\u201d he said.         \n\nDavid Goldman, an estate lawyer in Jacksonville who, along with another lawyer in Florida, Bob J. Howell, has helped popularize the use of gun trusts six years ago, said most dealers carried out background checks for restricted firearms. He called the notion that criminals might use the trusts to buy the firearms through a dealer \u201cridiculous.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/26/us/in-gun-trusts-a-legal-loophole-for-restricted-firearms.html", "date": "2013-02-25", "description": "Shooting enthusiasts are creating legal trusts to acquire firearms whose sale is limited by federal law, a mechanism that can bypass the requirement for a criminal background check."}
