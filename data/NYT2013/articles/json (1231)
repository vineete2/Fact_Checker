{"headline": "New Way to Deliver a Drama: All 13 Episodes in One Sitting", "body": "\nTelevision producers have turned bingeing, hoarding and overeating into successful prime-time shows for years, but now they are having to turn their attention to another example of overindulgence \u2014 TV watching.         \n\nBinge-viewing, empowered by DVD box sets and  \n subscriptions, has become such a popular way for Americans to watch TV that it is beginning to influence the ways the stories are told \u2014 particularly one-hour dramas \u2014 and how they are distributed.         \n\nSome people, pressured by their peers to watch \u201cMad Men\u201d or \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d catch up on previous seasons to see what all the fuss is about before a new season begins. Others plan weekend marathons of classics like \u201cThe West Wing\u201d and \u201cThe Wire.\u201d Like other American pastimes, it can get competitive: people have been known to brag about finishing a whole 12-episode season of \u201cHomeland\u201d in one sitting.         \n\nOn Friday, Netflix will release a drama expressly designed to be consumed in one sitting:  \n a political thriller starring Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright. Rather than introducing one episode a week, as distributors have done since the days of black-and-white TVs, all 13 episodes will be streamed at the same time. \u201cOur goal is to shut down a portion of America for a whole day,\u201d the producer Beau Willimon said with a laugh.         \n\n\u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d which is the first show made specifically for Netflix, dispenses with some of the traditions that are so common on network TV, like flashbacks. There is less reason to remind viewers what happened in previous episodes, the producers say, because so many viewers will have just seen it. And if they don\u2019t remember, Google is just a click away. The show \u201cassumes you know what\u2019s happening all the time, whereas television has to assume that a big chunk of the audience is always just tuning in,\u201d said Ted Sarandos, Netflix\u2019s chief content officer.         \n\nThe producer Glen Mazzara took a similar approach to AMC\u2019s \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d this year. In the second half of the season, which will start in mid-February after a two-month break, \u201cwe decided to pick up the action right away \u2014 to just jump right in,\u201d Mr. Mazzara said. Fans of the show, he said, have little tolerance for recaps, since many of them will have just watched a marathon of the first half to prepare for the second.         \n\nThat the fans even have a choice in the matter is a testament to the fundamental changes under way in the television business. Digital video recorders, video-on-demand capabilities and streaming Web sites have given viewers command of what they watch and when, not unlike the way the invention of supermarkets gave food shoppers a panoply of new choices. In both cases, some consumers love to binge.         \n\nWhile a large majority of TV is still watched live, not recorded, the ratings for some series \u2014 like FX\u2019s \u201cSons of Anarchy\u201d \u2014 double after a week of recorded viewing is counted. A  \n last fall found that a handful of shows gain an extra 5 percent after another three weeks.         \n\nNielsen does not routinely count viewers who wait more than a week to watch an episode, nor does it count most of the viewers who watch online, so it\u2019s hard to estimate the true amount of bingeing. Some hoarders wait years: Mr. Mazzara, for instance, said he\u2019s waiting to watch HBO\u2019s \u201cGirls\u201d until the whole series is over, several years from now. This stockpiling phenomenon has become so common that  \n worry that it is hurting new shows because they cancel the shows before would-be viewers get around to watching them.         \n\nKevin Reilly, the Fox Entertainment chairman, whose network has already canceled two of the three shows it introduced last fall, alluded to this problem at a news conference earlier this month. \u201cIf I bumped into one more person that was doing a \u2018Breaking Bad\u2019 marathon in the middle of our fall launch...,\u201d he said, trailing off as reporters laughed.         \n\nBut the networks are adapting to the generational shift from on-a-schedule to on-demand viewing. When Fox introduced its biggest bet of the season, \u201cThe Following,\u201d last week, it bought ads saying  \n And sure enough, episode No. 2 this week out-rated the premiere, suggesting that the ad campaign had worked.         \n\nIn recognition of the change, some networks are pushing to expand the metrics that determine advertising rates \u2014 from the current three-day ratings to a seven-day rating that would better account for on-demand habits.         \n\nBinge-viewing has been around at least since the advent of videotapes, when companies started to sell box sets of shows. But it has come of age because of the catalogs on Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and other Web sites.         \n\nSome media executives like to call the behavior \u201cmarathoning,\u201d since bingeing can have negative connotations. Either way, the behavior \u201cextends the life of a show,\u201d said Anthony Bay, the vice president for digital video at Amazon.         \n\nThat\u2019s been true for \u201cLost,\u201d which ended its run on ABC three years ago, but is still a hit on Netflix and Hulu. Damon Lindelof, a co-creator of the mystery, said he has found that some people enjoyed it more by watching from start to finish, without the weeklong and monthlong waits for answers. Bingers, he said, \u201cwere spared the anxiety and the stress of the weekly episodes.\u201d         \n\nFor a creator, he added, speaking to a roomful of producers and distributors in Miami this week, it\u2019s comforting to know that \u201cultimately the way your work is going to be viewed is more like reading a novel.\u201d         \n\nThat said, the traditional TV cliffhanger is far from dead. The producers of shows \u2014 even the five beginning on Netflix this year \u2014 know they have to satisfy multiple types of audiences. Said David Fincher, the acclaimed film director who is working with Mr. Willimon on \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d for Netflix, \u201cI want to make sure that people who set the book down on the night stand are able to connect the dots, but I also want the people who are rabidly turning pages to go, \u2018Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got all that.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nIn some corners of Hollywood there is deep skepticism about Netflix\u2019s all-at-once release of \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d Mr. Willimon acknowledged the advantages to stretching out a season \u2014 it\u2019s a format viewers are used to, there\u2019s more time for marketing \u2014 but said that as a storyteller (he\u2019s best known for the play \u201cFarragut North,\u201d which inspired the film \u201cThe Ides of March\u201d) he prefers the \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d approach.         \n\nAs television becomes less beholden to the schedule and more acclimated to the Web, he said, \u201cit might even dispense with episodes altogether. You might just get eight straight hours or 10 straight hours, and you decide where to pause.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/business/media/netflix-to-deliver-all-13-episodes-of-house-of-cards-on-one-day.html", "date": "2013-01-31", "description": "Binge-viewing has become such a popular way for Americans to watch TV that it is changing the ways that networks create and distribute episodes."}
