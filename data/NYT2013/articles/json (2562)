{"headline": "For Voice of Straphangers, a Journey Without Stops", "body": "\nGene Russianoff, who has spent most of his adult life reflecting upon and fretting about New York City\u2019s subways, remembers the first time he rode a train alone. He was 4 or 5. He was running away from home.         \n\nAt least, that is what he thinks he remembers. \u201cIt may be a real memory or a memory implanted in me by my parents,\u201d said Mr. Russianoff, who has long been the public face of the  \n, a nonprofit group that advocates for transit policies it believes serve the interests of subway and bus riders.         \n\n\u201cWe lived in Brighton Beach, exactly where the el is \u2014 now the B, then the D,\u201d he said over breakfast at a diner near his office in Lower Manhattan. \u201cI walked up the stairs, went underneath the turnstile, and took the train one stop.\u201d That would be to Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, where the Russianoffs would later relocate.         \n\n\u201cSomebody noticed there was this little kid on the platform,\u201d he continued. \u201cMy parents picked me up at the local precinct, and my mom said that the cops said, \u2018We\u2019ll give the kid back to you if you promise not to punish him.\u2019 Because I was so adorable.\u201d         \n\nMr. Russianoff laughed. He understood that not everyone in Albany or City Hall or at the  \n considers him, at 60, all that adorable. For certain, they respect him; he knows more subway arcana than some of them ever will. But he can also be a pull-no-punches critic of their actions, and frequent inaction. A thorn \u2014 even a personable one \u2014 is still a thorn if you are the one being jabbed.         \n\nWith the transportation authority having recently warned of yet more fare increases heading our way, it seemed a good time to invite Mr. Russianoff to a meal. He suggested a place called Naturally Delicious, on Broadway just south of City Hall Park. It was not naturally elegant.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m mainly a Cheerios guy, at home,\u201d Mr. Russianoff said. On this morning, he asked for orange juice, a fruit plate (which he only picked at) and a chocolate muffin (which he nibbled on, and eventually polished off). His interviewer ordered modestly himself: one scrambled egg with white toast, hold the potatoes. Yes, coffee please.         \n\nThere was never a doubt just what Mr. Russianoff would think of fare increases. As expected, he lamented the relatively heavy burden placed on New York City riders to keep their transit system running. On a percentage basis, they do not benefit from government subsidies nearly as much as riders do in, say, Chicago or Boston or Philadelphia.         \n\nBut wouldn\u2019t higher subsidies here lead inevitably to tax increases?         \n\n\u201cA fare hike is a tax hike,\u201d Mr. Russianoff said. \u201cSo pick your poison.\u201d         \n\nThe discussion focused more on his years at the Straphangers Campaign, which came into being in 1979, an offshoot of the New York Public Interest Research Group, where Mr. Russianoff remains a senior attorney. He started there in 1980, a newly minted lawyer by way of Brooklyn College and Harvard Law School.         \n\nAbout the organization\u2019s name \u2014 might it not be a tad dated? When was the last time a New York rider clung to a strap? The writer Daniel Okrent, who was this newspaper\u2019s first public editor, once mentioned in conversation that, as a transplant from the Midwest, he had thought on first seeing the name in print that it was pronounced Straffanjers.         \n\n\u201cPeople often are clueless about what a straphanger is,\u201d Mr. Russianoff acknowledged. \u201cBut we invested a lot in branding ourselves. And what\u2019s the alternative: the Barhangers?\u201d         \n\nWith the title of staff attorney and with financial support from an assortment of foundations, he has been a notable presence through the tenures of nine M.T.A. chairmen, ever banging the drum for better subway and bus service. He works on a simple premise: You have to speak up. And when you do, the people in charge might listen.         \n\nNo question, he has resorted to blatant gimmickry, like the Straphangers\u2019 annual presentation of its Pokey Award to the city\u2019s slowest bus, its Schleppie Award to the least reliable bus route, its schmutz ratings on subway car cleanliness.         \n\n\u201cThis is New York,\u201d Mr. Russianoff said. \u201cIf you have an issue and it\u2019s not on TV or on radio and in the newspapers, nobody hears you. So you have to figure out what\u2019s going to attract an audience.\u201d Basically, he added, it simply \u201ccrystallizes for the public what they know from their daily experience.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/26/nyregion/for-voice-of-straphangers-a-journey-without-stops.html", "date": "2013-08-25", "description": "Gene Russianoff, the public face of the Straphangers Campaign, understands that not everyone in Albany or City Hall or at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority considers him all that adorable."}
