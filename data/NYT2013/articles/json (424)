{"headline": "Series Was an Exclamation Point for James and for Stern", "body": "\nMIAMI \u2014 If there was one thing we knew about a thrilling N.B.A. finals that carried David Stern on its shoulders to the finish line of his three-decade playoff run as commissioner and chief baby sitter, it was that the series and the season would not conclude with Jeff Van Gundy signing off the network telecast by suggesting the Miami Heat consider trading LeBron James for Dwight Howard.         \n\nTwo years ago, in what was celebrated in 49 states and especially in northern Ohio as James\u2019s deserved comeuppance for the way he literally staged his departure from Cleveland, Van Gundy closed with that provocative commentary after James\u2019s well-documented failure in the six-game finals won by Dallas.         \n\n\u201cI did say they should consider that to better balance the team, not because I didn\u2019t think LeBron was good enough,\u201d Van Gundy said a little sheepishly before James took to the floor Thursday night for Game 7 against San Antonio.         \n\nWe all have our hot airtime to fill. We all jumped to conclusions ranging from impulsive to irrational back then and again along the precarious road to James\u2019s masterpiece in closing out the Spurs, 95-88, at American Airlines Arena.         \n\nIt is human nature to pontificate and prejudge, but the moral of the 2013 finals should be that on the complicated subject of legacy, never hazard a guess at halftime of a series or, worse, a career.         \n\nMichael Jordan was 28, or exactly James\u2019s age now, when he won his first championship with Chicago. Kobe Bryant \u2014 who, like James, entered the league out of high school \u2014 had three rings with the Los Angeles Lakers by his 28th birthday.         \n\nBut what if we had microanalyzed Bryant the way we chronically do James and ended up mischaracterizing Bryant as a born Tonto, or second banana, to Shaquille O\u2019Neal?         \n\nEveryone should understand by now that James is only clearing his throat, settling into the prime of his emotional maturity. In all basketball-related ways, he is no man-child anymore. The numbers alone \u2014 37 points, 12 rebounds, 4 assists, 2 steals, 2 turnovers in 45 minutes of owning the ball and the burden \u2014 fail to explain his dominance of Game 7.         \n\nAnd like a good and generous teammate, James made it about the collective when he sat in the interview room afterward. \u201cThis team is amazing,\u201d he said.         \n\nAfter hugging James at midcourt, Spurs Coach Gregg Popovich kissed Dwyane Wade\u2019s cheek and told him, \u201cYou were Dwyane Wade tonight,\u201d and that was certainly true. The Heat also needed all of Shane Battier\u2019s stunning 3-point marksmanship (6 for 8). But let\u2019s not kid ourselves. Miami was no superteam in the finals, those 27 straight regular-season victories notwithstanding.         \n\nWith Wade hurting, or declining, and Chris Bosh demonstrating again that he is no max-salary player, James\u2019s supporting cast was not as good as Jordan\u2019s on any of his six Bulls title teams.         \n\nWhen Jordan took his sabbatical in 1993-94, the so-called Jordanaires won 55 games and were probably one lousy call (the infamous Hue Hollins judgment  \n) from reaching the Eastern Conference finals. Without James, would this Miami team be guaranteed 45 victories and even the second round in the postseason?         \n\nIt was the sheer force of James\u2019s all-court versatility and his Jordanesque obsession with exerting himself on every play that finally gave Miami separation from the Spurs. Dared to shoot the jumper, he made five 3-pointers. And after a leg-weary Tim Duncan missed a short jump hook over the undersized Battier that would have tied the score, James drained the Spurs of a pulse with a 19-footer from the right side that gave the Heat a 92-88 lead with 27.9 seconds left.         \n\n\u201cI mean, I watched film, and my mind started to work and I said, O.K., this is how they\u2019re going to play me for the whole series,\u201d James said. \u201cI looked at all my regular-season stats, all my playoff stats, and I was one of the best midrange shooters in the game. I shot a career high from the 3-point line. I just told myself: Don\u2019t abandon what you\u2019ve done all year. Don\u2019t abandon now because they\u2019re going under.\u201d         \n\nThe Spurs finally knuckled under when Manu Ginobili, on the baseline, tried to pass the ball behind him to Duncan. Stepping into the passing lane, James got the steal.         \n\n\u201cLeBron was unbelievable,\u201d Duncan said.
