{"headline": "Former Defense Secretaries Criticize Obama on Syria", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama\u2019s first two defense secretaries publicly questioned the administration\u2019s handling of the Syrian crisis on Tuesday night and expressed skepticism about whether Russia can broker a deal to remove Syria\u2019s chemical weapons.         \n\nIn a joint appearance in Dallas, both former Pentagon chiefs, Robert M. Gates and Leon E. Panetta, were critical of Mr. Obama for asking Congress to authorize the use of force against Syria in retaliation over its use of chemical weapons. But they disagreed on whether military action would be an effective response. Mr. Gates said Mr. Obama\u2019s proposed military strike was a mistake, while Mr. Panetta said it was a mistake not to carry out an attack.         \n\n\u201cMy bottom line is that I believe that to blow a bunch of stuff up over a couple days, to underscore or validate a point or a principle, is not a strategy,\u201d Mr. Gates said during a forum at Southern Methodist University. \u201cIf we launch a military attack, in the eyes of a lot of people we become the villain instead of Assad,\u201d he added, referring to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria.         \n\nMr. Gates, the only cabinet member from the administration of George W. Bush whom Mr. Obama asked to stay, said missile strikes on Syria \u201cwould be throwing gasoline on a very complex fire in the Middle East.\u201d         \n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya taught us something about the unintended consequences of military action once it\u2019s launched?\u201d Mr. Gates said.         \n\nMr. Panetta, also speaking at the forum, said the president should have kept his word after he had pledged action if Syria used chemical weapons.         \n\n\u201cWhen the president of the United States draws a red line, the credibility of this country is dependent on him backing up his word,\u201d Mr. Panetta said.         \n\n\u201cOnce the president came to that conclusion, then he should have directed limited action, going after Assad, to make very clear to the world that when we draw a line and we give our word,\u201d then \u201cwe back it up,\u201d Mr. Panetta said.         \n\nMr. Gates and Mr. Panetta made their most extensive comments on current national security policy \u2014 and certainly their most critical statements on policies of the administration they both served \u2014 since leaving public service. Both former secretaries have announced plans to publish memoirs expected to shine more light on the internal policy debates of their tenures. Neither expressed a specific reason for breaking their silence on the Obama administration\u2019s decisions\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0night.         \n\nAsked about the comments at a news conference on Wednesday, the current defense secretary, Chuck Hagel, said he had \u201cthe greatest respect\u201d for his two predecessors, but added, \u201cObviously, I don\u2019t agree with their perspectives.\u201d         \n\nAnother former high-ranking Obama administration official, Michael J. Morell, who recently retired as the deputy director of the C.I.A., also expressed skepticism about the negotiations brokered by Russia.         \n\n\u201cI think this is the Syrians playing for time,\u201d Mr. Morell  \n\n \n in an interview published Tuesday on its Web site. \u201cI do not believe that they would seriously consider giving up their chemical weapons.\u201d         \n\nMr. Gates said he doubted whether President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was sincere in his efforts to broker a deal, and said he was skeptical that the Syrian government would disarm. He said it was absurd that Syria needed days or weeks to identify the location and size of its chemical weapons arsenal, and he suggested that the timetable should be an ultimatum of 48 hours.         \n\nWhen asked whether the West should trust Mr. Putin, Mr. Gates said, \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d         \n\nHe advocated identifying credible partners within the Syrian opposition and increasing support, including weapons \u2014 but not surface-to-air missiles, which could be seized by militants for terrorist acts against civilian aviation.         \n\nHe also supported a strategy of sanctions that labeled members of the Assad government as war criminals, with the threat of arrest if they left Syria, and suggested sanctions on Assad family members living or studying overseas, including on their financial holdings. Such pressure might prompt some in the inner circle to negotiate an end to the civil war, Mr. Gates said.         \n\nAlthough Mr. Gates said that any unilateral military action against Syria would be a mistake, he also said it was unwise for the president to have sought Congressional authorization to use force, because of the risk to presidential prestige if he was rebuffed.         \n\nIf Congress voted no, \u201cit would weaken him,\u201d Mr. Gates said. \u201cIt would weaken our country. It would weaken us in the eyes of our allies, as well as our adversaries around the world.\u201d         \n\nUnder questioning from the moderator, David Gergen, who advised four presidents and is now on the faculty at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, both former secretaries said that American credibility on Syria was essential to enduring efforts to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.         \n\n\u201cIran is paying very close attention to what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Mr. Panetta said. \u201cThere\u2019s no question in my mind they\u2019re looking at the situation, and what they are seeing right now is an element of weakness.\u201d         \n\nMr. Panetta said that the president \u201chas to retain the responsibility and the authority on this issue,\u201d and that it was wrong to \u201csubcontract\u201d the decision to Congress. \u201cMr. President, this Congress has a hard time agreeing as to what the time of day is,\u201d he said.
