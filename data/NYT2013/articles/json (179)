{"headline": "Solar Industry Anxious Over Defective Panels", "body": "\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 The solar panels covering a vast warehouse roof in the sun-soaked Inland Empire region east of Los Angeles were only two years into their expected 25-year life span when they began to fail.         \n\nCoatings that protect the panels disintegrated while other defects caused two fires that took the system offline for two years, costing hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost revenues.         \n\nIt was not an isolated incident. Worldwide, testing labs, developers, financiers and insurers are reporting similar problems and say the $77 billion solar industry is facing a quality crisis just as solar panels are on the verge of widespread adoption.         \n\nNo one is sure how pervasive the problem is. There are no industrywide figures about defective solar panels. And when defects are discovered, confidentiality agreements often keep the manufacturer\u2019s identity secret, making accountability in the industry all the more difficult.         \n\nBut at stake are billions of dollars that have financed solar installations, from desert power plants to suburban rooftops, on the premise that solar panels will more than pay for themselves over a quarter century.         \n\nThe quality concerns have emerged just after a surge in solar construction. In the United States, the Solar Energy Industries Association said that solar panel generating capacity exploded  \n, enough to power more than 1.2 million homes. Nearly half that capacity was installed in 2012 alone, meaning any significant problems may not become apparent for years.         \n\n\u201cWe need to face up to the fact that corners are being cut,\u201d said Conrad Burke, general manager for DuPont\u2019s billion-dollar  \n, which supplies materials to solar manufacturers.         \n\nThe  \n has had significant solar panel failures at several of its projects, according to Dave Williams, chief executive of the San Francisco-based company.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be alarmist, but I think quality poses a long-term threat,\u201d he said. \u201cThe quality across the board is harder to put your finger on now as materials in modules are changing every day and manufacturers are reluctant to share that information.\u201d         \n\nMost of the concerns over quality center on China, home to the majority of the world\u2019s solar panel manufacturing capacity.         \n\nAfter incurring billions of dollars in debt to accelerate production that has sent solar panel prices plunging since 2009, Chinese solar companies are under extreme pressure to cut costs.         \n\nChinese banks in March, for instance,  \ninto bankruptcy. Until 2012, the company had been the world\u2019s biggest solar manufacturer.         \n\nExecutives at companies that inspect Chinese factories on behalf of developers and financiers said that over the last 18 months they have found that even the most reputable companies are substituting cheaper, untested materials. Other brand-name manufacturers, they said, have shut down production lines and subcontracted the assembly of modules to smaller makers.         \n\n\u201cWe have inspectors in a lot of factories, and it\u2019s not rare to see some big brands being produced in those smaller workshops where they have no control over quality,\u201d said Thibaut Lemoine, general manager of  \n, a French-owned testing service. When STS evaluated 215,000 photovoltaic modules at its Shanghai laboratory in 2011 and 2012, it found the defect rate had jumped from 7.8 percent to 13 percent.         \n\nIn one case, an entire batch of modules from one brand-name manufacturer listed on the New York Stock Exchange proved defective, Mr. Lemoine said. He declined to identify the manufacturer, citing confidentiality agreements.         \n\n\u201cBased on our testing, some manufacturers are absolutely swapping in cheap Chinese materials to save money,\u201d Jenya Meydbray, chief executive of  \n, a Berkeley, Calif., testing service.         \n\n \n, a company based in Marlborough, Mass., discovered defect rates of 5.5 percent to 22 percent during audits of 50 Chinese factories over the last 18 months, said Ian Gregory, the company\u2019s senior marketing director.         \n\nSome Chinese manufacturers acknowledge that quality has become a problem         \n\n\u201cThere are a lot of shortcuts being taken, and unfortunately it\u2019s by some of the more reputable companies and there\u2019s also been lot of new companies starting up in recent years without the same standards we\u2019ve had at Suntech,\u201d said Stuart Wenham, the chief technology officer of Suntech, which is based in Jiangsu Province in eastern China.         \n\nWhen asked about quality standards,  \n, one of the largest Chinese manufacturers, said in an e-mailed response, \u201cFor Trina, quality will not be compromised in our cost-reduction efforts.\u201d         \n\nThe heart of a solar panel is a photovoltaic cell that generates electricity when struck by sunlight. Among the most critical components are a thin film that protects the cell from moisture, and the encapsulant that seals the cell between layers of glass.         \n\nMr. Gregory said repeat inspections of factories found some manufacturers had been constantly switching to cheaper materials, including some whose use-by date had expired.         \n\n\u201cIf the materials aren\u2019t good or haven\u2019t been thoroughly tested, they won\u2019t stick together and the solar module will eventually fall apart in the field,\u201d he said.
