{"headline": "Stanford\u2019s Distinct Training Regimen Redefines Strength", "body": "\nPALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 Inside the Stanford weight room earlier this football season, there were weight vests and wooden sticks and core boards. There were kettle bells and roller pads and something called a Bod Pod, a white, egg-shaped contraption that measures body fat.         \n\nThere were football players, too: pairs with legs bent, a towel held between them for balance; others climbing ropes like back in gym class; working on hip mobility and shoulder stability; the focus not on brute strength, even for a team as physical as Stanford.         \n\nAnd there was Shannon Turley, the architect of a training regimen among the most distinct in college sports. He is Stanford\u2019s director of football sports performance, and for years, he felt it necessary to write letters to N.F.L. scouts to explain the Cardinal\u2019s nontraditional approach. He stopped that practice this year in the wake of Stanford\u2019s success.         \n\nTurley\u2019s impact speaks as much to availability as ability. The coaches recruit speed and size and talent. He believes the best players, the ones most on the field, who sustain the most collisions, also carry the most injury risk. His first priority is to keep them on the field.         \n\nFrom 2006, the year before Turley arrived on the Farm, as Stanford\u2019s campus is known, through last season, the number of games missed because of injury on the two-deep roster dropped by 87 percent. In 2012, only two Cardinal players required season-ending or postseason surgical repair; this year, only one.         \n\nIn an era in which injuries are more scrutinized than ever, this has made Turley something of a celebrity strength coach. Counterparts from other colleges visited. As did N.F.L. personnel. As did Australian Rules football teams. The student newspaper wrote a three-part series about Turley. Bleacher Report compiled a big article. The National Strength and Conditioning Association named Turley its strength and conditioning coach of the year in 2013.         \n\nStanford lost quarterback Andrew Luck, running back Toby Gerhart and Coach Jim Harbaugh to the N.F.L., and yet the Cardinal will make their fourth consecutive Bowl Championship Series appearance Wednesday in the Rose Bowl against Michigan State. The year before Turley arrived, Stanford went 1-11.         \n\nTurley considered all that inside his weight room, as he surveyed the flurry of activity around him. \u201cThis,\u201d he said, \u201cis real-world applicable man strength.\u201d         \n\nThis is the era of the strength coach in college football. Strength coaches oversee conditioning in the off-season. They also deal with being allowed fewer scholarships.         \n\nTurley is a strength coach, and he is not a strength coach, or not exactly. Strength is not his focus. Function is. Balance is. Flexibility is.         \n\nHis approach is grounded in physics, on the premise that low man wins on contact, that to get low requires mobility and stability and the ability to apply force in the opposite direction. His players bench press, but he cares more about how they lift \u2014 with hands closer together, without bouncing the bar off their chests \u2014 than how much. He wants them to bend all the way down when they squat.         \n\nFreshmen in Turley\u2019s program do not lift weights upon arrival. Instead, for the first few weeks, they do \u201cbody work,\u201d or push-ups and pull-ups and squats or lunges without weights; basically old-school, military calisthenics.         \n\n\u201cYou have all these different genres of training, and we steal from them all,\u201d Turley said. \u201cCrossFit. Bodybuilding. Power lifting. But ultimately, it\u2019s none of those. It\u2019s a system we\u2019ve developed to train football players.\u201d         \n\nA self-described terrible athlete, Turley was always better at training for a sport than playing it. At Virginia Tech, he volunteered as a student assistant trainer. He noticed the best players in the weight room often were not the best players on the field. That made little sense.         \n\nHe read research papers and went to clinics and peppered trainers and physical therapists and doctors with questions. He watched YouTube clips. He devoured training manuals.
