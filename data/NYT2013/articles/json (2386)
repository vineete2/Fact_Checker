{"headline": "YouTube Is Said to Plan a Subscription Option", "body": "\nNewspapers have digital subscriptions. Record labels have iTunes and Spotify. And  \n is about to have special programming for paying customers.         \n\nThis week YouTube, the world\u2019s largest video Web site, will announce a plan to let some video makers charge a monthly subscription to their channels. There will be paid channels for children\u2019s programming, entertainment, music and many other topic areas, according to people with knowledge of the plan, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they had been asked by YouTube not to comment publicly yet. Some of the channels \u2014 there will be several dozen at the outset \u2014 will cost as little as $1.99 a month.         \n\nIf the subscription option catches on, it could herald a huge change for the online video industry, which has subsisted almost entirely on advertising revenue. It could give producers of Web video series a second source of revenue, analogous in some ways to the flexible pay walls that some newspapers and magazines have adopted. It could also put more pressure on the cable television industry, which is fighting off fresh competition from the Web.         \n\nFor now, though, it is just a test, intended in part to mollify some of the most popular contributors to the sprawling Web site. The overwhelming majority of videos on YouTube, a unit of  \n, will remain free to all. But some homegrown YouTube stars, start-ups and major media companies have been frustrated by what they see as relatively low amounts of revenue coming from the ads that YouTube attaches to their videos. By enabling the subscription option, YouTube is giving them another way to profit from their work \u2014 if their fans are willing to pay to watch, that is.         \n\nSome of YouTube\u2019s partners planned to start promoting their paid channels on Thursday, though the announcements could come sooner, in light of recent news coverage. (The Financial Times \n that the announcements were expected as early as this week.) YouTube will process the payments through Google Wallet, the system that Google\u2019s app store uses.         \n\nAs YouTube users read about the plan on Monday, many\u00a0objected to paying for something they treat as free and ubiquitous as air and water. But others said there were some channels worth paying a few bucks for.         \n\nA YouTube spokesman declined to comment on the specifics of the subscription plan. In a statement the company said, \u201cWe have nothing to announce at this time, but we\u2019re looking into creating a subscription platform that could bring even more great content to YouTube for our users to enjoy and provide our partners with another vehicle to generate revenue from their content, beyond the rental and ad-supported models we offer.\u201d         \n\nPaid subscriptions to YouTube channels are a long time coming; Google applied for a patent for a \u201cself-service channel marketplace\u201d in 2011, and the subscription plan has been an open secret in the industry almost since then.         \n\nThe plan has gained momentum as Netflix, Hulu and Amazon have drawn in subscribers for their video offerings. Netflix has nearly 30 million streaming subscribers in the United States; Hulu\u2019s paid service, Hulu Plus, has about four million. Amazon has not said how many people pay for Amazon Prime, which includes its video service, but the number is known to be in the millions.         \n\nOther companies, like AOL and Yahoo, have invested in free video programming, supported by advertisers. YouTube\u2019s strategy stands out from all the rest; its infrastructure increasingly lets video makers be their own Netflixes and Hulus, albeit on a smaller scale. It looks more like the \u00e0 la carte model of a newsstand than the bundled channel model of cable television.         \n\nYouTube pitched two options to potential partners: one version of paid channels with ads (allowing for two sources of revenue, like cable television channels have) and one version without ads. The ad-free option was appealing to programmers of children\u2019s channels, several of which will be available soon, according to some people briefed on the plan.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a worthy experiment,\u201d said Laura Martin, a senior analyst at Needham & Company, who has advocated for dual revenue streams for all manner of media companies. She said Hulu Plus and The New York Times\u2019s online subscriptions were two successful models for producers who might try paid channels.         \n\nAnother appealing aspect of the pitch was this: some of the paid channels will be available internationally, in 10 countries to start, allowing for a vast potential audience overseas.         \n\nThe subscriptions will not be for channels in the television sense of the term; rather, they will consist of libraries of videos on demand, much like the thousands of free channels already on YouTube. Some of the video makers who have worked with YouTube on the subscription option want to convert fans to paying customers; others hope to distinguish themselves by selling archives of old television episodes.         \n\nBut for YouTube, at least, advertising will remain the basis of its business. The company was estimated to take in $1.3 billion in ad revenues last year, and that number could climb to $2 billion this year, according to a recent report by Pivotal Research.         \n\nYouTube executives held a promotional event for advertisers in New York last week and did not bring up the forthcoming paid channels or its past ventures into financing professionally produced channels. (It supplied an estimated $300 million to producers in 2011 and 2012, but it has backed away from that strategy of late.)         \n\n\u201cI thought YouTube was like TV. I was wrong. It isn\u2019t,\u201d Robert Kyncl, the company\u2019s global head of content, said at the event. YouTube, unlike television, is interactive, he said. \u201cAnd YouTube is everywhere.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/07/business/media/youtube-said-to-be-planning-a-subscription-option.html", "date": "2013-05-06", "description": "The Web site was expected this week to announce a plan to let some video makers convert fans into paying customers."}
