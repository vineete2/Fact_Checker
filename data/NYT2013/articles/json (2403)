{"headline": "On a College Waiting List? Sending Cookies Isn\u2019t Going to Help", "body": "\nWhen Amanda Wolfbauer, a high school senior, received the admissions verdict from  \n, in Clinton, N.Y., she posted on Twitter, \u201cWhat does one do once they\u2019re on a college waitlist? #frustrated #worsethanrejection.\u201d         \n\nA few minutes later she had gone from dejected to dogged: \u201cWell, @HamiltonAdmssn prepare to be dazzled, because I\u2019m determined to get off that waitlist.\u201d         \n\nSince then, Ms. Wolfbauer, of Carver, Minn., says she has written the admissions department to tell it \u201chow much I want to go there and why Hamilton has been my No. 1 choice since the beginning of my college search\u201d; she sent in \u201ca lot of high school projects,\u201d including one that won a statewide competition; and last weekend she started filming a video with friends \u2014 teachers to be added later \u2014 \u201cbasically telling them how awesome I am, talking about the positive qualities I have and why Hamilton should accept me.\u201d         \n\nDoes she ever worry it might be too much? \u201cI more worry that I\u2019m not doing enough,\u201d she said.         \n\nEspecially not while other students on waiting lists are bombarding their dream schools with baked goods, family photos, craft projects depicting campus landmarks and dossiers of testimonials from civic and religious leaders, to name just a few come-ons that admissions offices have seen over the past month.         \n\nFor most applicants to selective colleges, the letters that arrived by April 1 brought an end to months of anxious wondering. But for some small fraction of those students, the tension is only now reaching its apex. They were assigned not to the relief of the yes pile, or the decisiveness of the no pile, but to the slender median of the maybe, with no idea how their application will be resolved, or even when.         \n\nThe schools generally ask those students to send word of whether they wish to stay on the waiting list or want to be removed from consideration.         \n\n\u201cWe encourage wait-listed students who remain very interested in  \n to send a brief letter affirming that interest and updating us on their senior year,\u201d said Jessica Marinaccio, Columbia University\u2019s dean of undergraduate admissions, \u201cand discourage them from sending extra letters of recommendation or other supplementary materials.\u201d         \n\nGiven the high stakes and the opaque proceedings, however, some students just cannot hold back.         \n\nAdmissions officers describe the dynamic in terms that sound like dating: hopeful students are trying to express their interest without coming off like a stalker, while colleges are trying to figure out whether the students are courting other institutions on the side.         \n\n\u201cLast year, I had a girl who wrote to me every day,\u201d recalled Monica Inzer, Hamilton\u2019s dean of admissions. \u201cShe\u2019d send me e-mails; she\u2019d send me letters; she had alums write to me. We all knew that this girl wanted us more than anyone else.\u201d         \n\nWhen a total of three spots in the freshman class opened up, that eager young woman was the first person Ms. Inzer called. \u201cShe said, \u2018Eh, I\u2019m going someplace else.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nAnother applicant eagerly informed Ann Fleming Brown, the director of admissions at  \n, in Schenectady, N.Y., that the college was her first choice \u2014 or had become that when her true first choice, Bowdoin, rejected her. It is just one of the many ways, Ms. Brown and her colleagues at other schools say, that students on the waiting list have shot themselves in the foot in recent years.         \n\nThey have insulted the college\u2019s judgment or taste. They have disparaged classmates who already got in. They have threatened to go over the admissions officer\u2019s head. Showing up and demanding an interview is inadvisable. Showing up with a camping tent, even more so.         \n\nAnd parents are often part of the problem. \u201cThere\u2019s a mother who e-mails me every third day \u2014 they must have timers on these things,\u201d Ms. Brown said. \u201cThere\u2019s one parent who calls up and yells at me: \u2018I can\u2019t believe this happened! This is a horrible thing!\u2019 And then he calls 10 minutes later and says, \u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 Then he calls and says, \u2018I know you don\u2019t like me. I\u2019m being a complete pest.\u2019\u00a0\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/12/education/on-the-waiting-list-some-college-applicants-try-a-little-dazzle.html", "date": "2013-05-11", "description": "Students are bombarding their dream schools with baked goods, craft projects and dossiers of testimonials in an effort to get an edge \u2014 and get off the waiting list."}
