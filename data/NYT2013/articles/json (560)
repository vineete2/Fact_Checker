{"headline": "Morsi Faces\nUltimatum as\nAllies Speak of\nMilitary \u2018Coup\u2019", "body": "\nCAIRO \u2014 Egypt entered a perilous 48 hours on Monday when the military delivered an ultimatum to the country\u2019s first democratically elected president, hundreds of thousands of protesters renewed calls to oust him from office and the president\u2019s Islamists allies vowed to take to the streets to stop what they called \u201ca military coup.\u201d         \n\nIn a military communiqu\u00e9 read over state television that echoed the announcement toppling former President Hosni Mubarak two chaotic years ago, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces demanded Monday that President Mohamed Morsi satisfy the public\u2019s demands within two days, or else the generals would impose their own \u201croad map\u201d out of the crisis.         \n\nBut instead of soothing the volatile standoff between Mr. Morsi\u2019s opponents and his supporters, the generals seemed to add to the uncertainty that has paralyzed the state, decimated the economy and brought millions into the streets Sunday demanding the president step down. It was not clear what the military meant when it said Mr. Morsi must satisfy the public\u2019s demands, what it might do if that vague standard was not met and who would be able to unite this badly fractured nation.         \n\nThe generals did, however, open a new confrontation with Mr. Morsi\u2019s allies in the Muslim Brotherhood with its threat to impose a political \u201croad map\u201d on the president. Brotherhood members rallied in half a dozen cities to denounce the threat of a military takeover, a reminder that the group remains a potent force unwilling to give up the power it has waited 80 years to wield.         \n\n\u201cWe understand it as a military coup,\u201d one adviser to Mr. Morsi said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential negotiations. \u201cWhat form that will take remains to be seen.\u201d         \n\nMr. Morsi and the military\u2019s top officer, Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi, entered a delicate negotiation on Monday, one fraught with risks for both men, and for the nation. Racked with fuel shortages, dwindling hard currency reserves and worries about its wheat supplies, Egypt urgently needs a government stable and credible enough to manage difficult and disruptive economic reforms. A move by the military to force the Brotherhood from power, despite its electoral victories, could set off an Islamist backlash in the streets that would make stability and economic growth even more elusive.         \n\nPresident Obama called Mr. Morsi late Monday night, Mr. Morsi\u2019s aides said. They described Mr. Obama\u2019s message as a confirmation that the White House was continuing to deal with Mr. Morsi as Egypt\u2019s elected president and to support the country\u2019s transition to civilian democracy.         \n\nObama administration officials could not immediately be reached for comment about the call. Earlier Monday in Tanzania, Mr. Obama expressed concern about the protests in Egypt but said the situation was different from the earlier protests that had prompted the United States to call for the departure of Mr. Mubarak. \u201cWhen I took a position that it was time for Egypt to transition, it was based on the fact that Egypt had not had democratic government for decades, if ever,\u201d he said         \n\nNow that Egypt has such a government, he said, \u201cthere\u2019s more work to be done to create the condition where everybody believes their voices are heard.\u201d He urged both sides to refrain from violence, and specifically mentioned reports of assaults on women in Egypt, saying that \u201cassaulting women does not qualify as peaceful protests.\u201d         \n\nIn a sternly worded statement issued after 1 a.m. Tuesday, Mr. Morsi\u2019s office said it was continuing with its plans for dialogue and reconciliation with its opponents. Noting that it was not consulted before the military made its statement, Mr. Morsi\u2019s office asserted that \u201csome of its phrases have connotations that may cause confusion in the complicated national scene\u201d and suggested that it \u201cdeepens the division between the people\u201d and \u201cmay threaten the social peace no matter what the motivation.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/02/world/middleeast/egypt-protests.html", "date": "2013-07-01", "description": "A 48-hour ultimatum to President Mohamed Morsi of Egypt left him with few choices to resolve growing unrest and plunged the military back into the center of politics, less than a year after Mr. Morsi and his Muslim Brotherhood took power."}
