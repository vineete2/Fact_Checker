{"headline": "Loans Borrowed Against Pensions Squeeze Retirees", "body": "\nTo retirees, the offers can sound like the answer to every money worry: convert tomorrow\u2019s pension checks into today\u2019s hard cash.         \n\nBut these offers, known as pension advances, are having devastating financial consequences for a growing number of older Americans, threatening their retirement savings and plunging them further into debt. The advances, federal and state authorities say, are not advances at all, but carefully disguised loans that require borrowers to sign over all or part of their monthly pension checks. They carry interest rates that are often many times higher than those on credit cards.         \n\nIn lean economic times, people with public pensions \u2014 military veterans, teachers, firefighters, police officers and others \u2014 are being courted particularly aggressively by pension-advance companies, which operate largely outside of state and federal banking regulations, but are now drawing scrutiny from Congress and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.         \n\nThe pitches come mostly via the Web or ads in local circulars.         \n\n\u201cConvert your pension into CASH,\u201d LumpSum Pension Advance, of Irvine, Calif., says on its Web site. \u201cBanks are hiding,\u201d says Pension Funding L.L.C., of Huntington Beach, Calif., on its Web site, signaling the paucity of credit. \u201cBut you do have your pension benefits.\u201d         \n\nAnother ad on that Web site is directed at military veterans: \u201cYou\u2019ve put your life on the line for Americans to protect our way of life. You deserve to do something important for yourself.\u201d         \n\nA review by The New York Times of more than two dozen contracts for pension-based loans found that after factoring in various fees, the effective interest rates ranged from 27 percent to 106 percent \u2014 information not disclosed in the ads or in the contracts themselves. Furthermore, to qualify for one of the loans, borrowers are sometimes required to take out a life insurance policy that names the lender as the sole beneficiary.         \n\nLumpSum Pension Advance and Pension Funding did not return calls and e-mails for comment.         \n\nWhile it is difficult to say precisely how many financially struggling people have taken out pension loans, legal aid offices in Arizona, California, Florida and New York say they have recently encountered a surge in complaints from retirees who have run into trouble with the loans.         \n\nRonald E. Govan, a Marine Corps veteran in Snellville, Ga., paid an interest rate of more than 36 percent on a pension-based loan. He said he was enraged that veterans were being targeted by the firm, Pensions, Annuities & Settlements, which did not return calls for comment.         \n\n\u201cI served for this country,\u201d said Mr. Govan, a Vietnam veteran, \u201cand this is what I get in return.\u201d         \n\nThe allure of borrowing against pensions underscores an abrupt reversal in the financial fortunes of many retirees in recent years, as well as the efforts by a number of financial firms, including payday lenders and debt collectors, to market directly to them.         \n\nThe pension-advance firms geared up before the financial crisis to woo a vast and wealthy generation of Americans heading for retirement. Before the housing bust and recession forced many people to defer retirement and to run up debt, lenders marketed the pension-based loan largely to military members as a risk-free option for older Americans looking to take a dream vacation or even buy a yacht. \u201cSplurge,\u201d one advertisement in 2004 suggested.         \n\nNow, pension-advance firms are repositioning themselves to appeal to people in and out of the military who need cash to cover basic living expenses, according to interviews with borrowers, lawyers, regulators and advocates for the elderly.         \n\n\u201cThe cost of these pension transactions can be astronomically high,\u201d said Stuart Rossman, a lawyer with the  \n, an advocacy group that works on issues of economic justice for low-income people.         \n\n\u201cBut there is profit to be made on older Americans\u2019 financial pain.\u201d         \n\nThe oldest members of the baby boom generation became eligible for Social Security during the recent housing bust and recession, and many nearing retirement age watched their investments plummet in value. Some are now sliding deep into debt to make ends meet.
