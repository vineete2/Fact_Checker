But by using basic physics to estimate riders\u2019 power output up the 13.8-kilometer climb, he said he believed he could compare current Tour performances with those of riders past, particularly those from the heyday of cycling\u2019s doping culture.         \n\nHis focus will be on one man in particular: Chris Froome, the race leader. In Stage 8 in the Pyrenees, Froome, a British rider on Sky Procycling, sped away from the pack with a power and speed not seen since Lance Armstrong, whose seven Tour titles were stripped because of doping.         \n\nTucker is not accusing Froome of using banned substances, and Froome has never been tied to doping. But Tucker\u2019s efforts to raise concerns have prompted Sky to deride his calculations as \u201cpseudoscience.\u201d Even many scientists in the field question the accuracy of his data and the fairness of his methodology.         \n\n\u201cThey want to sensationalize certain results,\u201d said Edward Coyle, a professor of kinesiology at the University of Texas at Austin.         \n\nBut Tucker said that uncomfortable questions are what the sport needs right now to clean up its image. \u201cThe scrutiny the questions bring helps, in my opinion, to drive transparency, and build credibility,\u201d he said.         \n\nIn his gadfly quest, Tucker is part of a small group of physiologists, sports doctors and cycling enthusiasts from around the globe who have formed a loose alliance on the Internet to weed out doping in cycling. Like investigative journalists armed with calculators instead of note pads, they are pressing professional teams to allow independent analysis of riders\u2019 doping tests and physiological data.         \n\nTheir outside scrutiny is essential, they argue, because many of the athletes revealed as dopers in recent years \u2014 including Armstrong \u2014 were not exposed by drug tests. Not only did the athletes manage to stay a step ahead of the testing protocols, but the sport itself seemed unwilling, or unable, to clean itself up.         \n\n\u201cPeople want to believe the sport has changed,\u201d said Tucker, a senior lecturer in sports science at Cape Town University, who runs a Web site called Sportsscientists.com. \u201cBut the sport is saying: \u2018Trust me.\u2019 Well, we trusted you before and before that and before that. And you\u2019ve never, ever delivered on your promises. So let\u2019s get some data.\u201d         \n\nThough their work is contentious and often criticized, it is also read by riders and cycling journalists. The debate it has sparked may be having an impact. This week Sky said it may be willing to release physiological information about Froome and other riders for scrutiny by the World Anti-Doping Agency.         \n\n\u201cThen they could tell the world \u2014 and you \u2014 whether this is credible or not,\u201d David Brailsford, the team general manager, told reporters on Monday.         \n\nIn his mild-mannered way, Froome seems genuinely wounded by the questions. Hard training, including at high altitudes, and not drugs, is behind his remarkable run at this Tour, he said this week.         \n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s sad that we\u2019re sitting here on the day after the biggest win of my life talking about doping,\u201d he said Monday, a day after he won Stage 15 atop Mont Ventoux. \u201cLance cheated. I\u2019m not cheating.\u201d         \n\nTucker and his allies talk in the cautious language of science, but at heart they are like scorned lovers, burned by doping revelations about their favorite racers. For Tucker, it was Armstrong. For one of his allies, Michael Puchowicz, a sports medicine doctor at Arizona State University, it was Floyd Landis, whose 2006 Tour victory was stripped after he tested positive for testosterone.         \n\n\u201cThat was pretty hard,\u201d Puchowicz said.
