{"headline": "Individuals Find Ideas in the Institutional Investment World", "body": "\nMAYBE the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index crossing 1,800 this week is a sign of a stock market bubble, or maybe the companies that compose it will continue to grow. There are arguments for both, but the correct answer will be clear only at some point in the future.         \n\nFor investors trying to make rational decisions about their portfolio today, this is little comfort. The chatter can be scary. And advice like \u201cstay the course\u201d is about as helpful as telling someone to stop worrying and be happy.         \n\nSure, there are plenty of advisers working with their clients on financial plans. But these plans can be too general and easy not to follow. Recently, I started hearing more about advisers who were adapting something from the institutional investment world for individual clients: investment policy statements, which are commonly used by foundations and endowments to create parameters for how securities are bought and sold and guidelines for making changes to holdings and hiring and firing managers.         \n\nAn I.P.S., as it is known, is to a financial plan what a Range Rover is to a minivan. Both will carry your children safely, but only the Range Rover will power up a gravelly mountain. Of course, most people who own a Range Rover are traveling the same, well-paved suburban streets as the minivan driver, making all that engineering a bit of overkill.         \n\nTo some, the same argument can be made for an I.P.S. It\u2019s just too much. But the people I spoke with who had one talked about a difference in their investment performance and their state of mind.         \n\nRobert McCarthy, a lawyer who held senior positions at MTV, Viacom and Time Warner, said he started working with an adviser who uses an I.P.S. in late 2009. \u201cI was very chastened,\u201d he said. An I.P.S. \u201cwas a guide to the level of risk in each portfolio.\u201d         \n\nLike many, though, Mr. McCarthy came to this the hard way. He is on his third adviser since big losses in 2000 and 2008. The same thing happened with David A. Gelb, a periodontist with expertise in implant surgery. His portfolio today is the same value as it was in 2000, before it dropped by nearly two-thirds. Now he is a true believer when it comes to an I.P.S.         \n\n\u201cI said, \u2018My God, why didn\u2019t any of my other advisers ever discuss something like this with me?\u2019 \u201d Dr. Gelb said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have an objective or a game plan, how predictable can you be?\u201d         \n\nIn its structure, an I.P.S. is fairly simple. Investors sit down with their advisers and assess their return objectives and comfort with risk. Then the adviser designs the portfolio with that in mind. Where an I.P.S. goes further than a financial plan is that it sets a target allocation for each type of security \u2014 say, stocks \u2014 and adds an upper and a lower range for the percentage of the portfolio that can be in that security.         \n\nIn the case of Mr. McCarthy, the I.P.S. for him and his wife sets a target of 40 percent for stocks. That percentage can go as high as 60 percent and as low as 20 percent.         \n\n\u201cIf I get nervous about the state of the stock market and say, \u2018This is too frothy,\u2019 the exposure gets reduced, but it won\u2019t go below the minimum equity number,\u201d he said. \u201cBut market performance can have that effect, too. If you go over the maximum number, it gets reduced.\u201d         \n\nThe idea is to keep people from getting so bullish that they overcommit to a sector and lose when it inevitably falls, or so bearish that they sell their investments and go to cash.         \n\n\u201cThis is standard operating procedure for an endowment, a foundation or a pension,\u201d said John W. Rafal, the founder and vice chairman of Essex Financial Services, which manages approximately $4 billion for individuals and institutions. \u201cAfter the crashes of 2000 through 2003 and then the crash of 2007, \u201908, and \u201909, we thought this would give our clients the same protections we give to pensions.\u201d         \n\nBeyond establishing the ranges for a particular type of investment, Mr. Rafal says he asks clients about their investment history, comfort with risk and knowledge of asset classes but also about their family history, education, sophistication, views on giving money to charity and their children and, ultimately, use for their money.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s to keep everyone rational in irrational markets,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s never going to be perfect with an individual, but it\u2019s better than if you have no policy.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/23/your-money/individuals-find-ideas-in-the-institutional-investment-world.html", "date": "2013-11-22", "description": "Some wealthy investors are exploring investment policy statements, which are used by foundations to create parameters for how securities are bought and sold."}
