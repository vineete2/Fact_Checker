{"headline": "Dismiss Diversification at Your Own Risk", "body": "\n \n         \n\nEvery few months, we see headlines declaring that once-hot markets have cooled. It\u2019s time to kick these losers aside, the conventional wisdom tells us, and search out the next big deal. Of late, we\u2019re told, both international and emerging markets have been widely criticized as weak performers and investors would be wise to move on to other markets.         \n\nIf we take a look at the end of the third quarter in 2013, it\u2019s easy to see why. The United States stock market (Russell 3000 Index) is up 21.30 percent for the year. International developed stocks (MSCI World ex USA Index) are up \u201conly\" 14.66 percent, and emerging markets (MSCI Emerging Markets Index) are down 4.35 percent. It seems as if the evidence is clear. Why would we want or need anything other than American stocks?         \n\nBut wait, we all know we shouldn\u2019t make decisions based on only three quarters, right? So let\u2019s pull back and take a look at how these three markets performed over five years.         \n\nFor the last five years (ending in the third quarter of 2013), the United States stock market had an annualized return of 10.58 percent. International developed stocks were up 6.12 percent, and emerging markets were up 7.22 percent. The numbers aren\u2019t bad, but now it seems really clear: We\u2019ve got five whole years of data, and they still seem to imply that we\u2019d be better off if we were only invested in American stocks.         \n\nWhat are we waiting for? Well, before we pick up the phone and give the order to sell, let\u2019s take a look at one more thing. How did these markets perform (annualized) over 10 years?         \n\n\u25a0\u2009U.S. stocks = 8.11 percent         \n\n\u25a0\u2009International developed = 8.18 percent         \n\n\u25a0\u2009Emerging markets = 12.80 percent         \n\nMaybe the answer isn\u2019t so clear after all. Ten years ago, we didn\u2019t have any way of knowing that emerging markets, a current target for the sell-now crowd, would still perform more than 4 percent better than the United States market at the 10-year mark. For those of you keeping track, that\u2019s Example 387 for why we shouldn\u2019t be so quick to dismiss diversification.         \n\nOf course, some of you might argue that if an investor picked any of these three options, diversification wouldn\u2019t matter because the performance for all three was positive.Reaching this point, however, would also require that an investor hadn\u2019t done something silly during those 10 years, like sell everything when any one of these markets dropped off a cliff at different times.         \n\nBy choosing to blend different, complementary investments (known as diversifying), we\u2019re spreading out our risk and creating opportunities for different parts of our portfolios to zig when others zag. A diversified portfolio means that some investments will do well while a few are doing poorly and others are doing average.         \n\nThat\u2019s perhaps the biggest risk of diversification: comparison. It\u2019s really easy to focus on the ones that are doing well and compare them with the ones that aren\u2019t doing equally well, but that\u2019s what makes diversification so useful to the average investor. We have no way of predicting the winners and the losers. Diversification helps us cover a range of possibilities.         \n\nOf course, diversification is an easy target for criticism when our window of time is short. Yes, if we\u2019re judging our investing success based on the year-to-date results for the third quarter in 2013, it would seem like diversifying into markets outside the United States is unnecessary. But one quarter shouldn\u2019t become the definition of investing success or failure for investors.         \n\nI also understand why it\u2019s tempting to think that we don\u2019t need diversification. It can be difficult to watch portions of our portfolios climb sky-high while others seem to be lost in the wilderness. But until the day that markets become predictable, we\u2019re in for a bumpy ride if we dismiss the benefits of diversification. Of course, diversification doesn\u2019t eliminate all risks, but it\u2019s one fantastic shock absorber. So it frustrates me when I hear of investors being advised to leave this valuable tool on the sidelines.         \n\nWhen we diversify, we\u2019re also setting up guardrails to help us make smart, disciplined decisions. For instance, what would we do if we were holding one particular investment after it experienced a down quarter? Odds are high we\u2019d be looking around for a different investment that\u2019s doing well. This approach creates the classic buy high/sell low behavior that isn\u2019t good for any investor.         \n\nBut what happens when we make use of diversification? To use a very simplified example, imagine we divide a portfolio into equal portions of three different investments. The financial plan then calls for maintaining an equal split among the three.         \n\nNow at the end of a quarter when one investment is up a lot while the other two are down, we know what comes next: rebalancing. Diversification, in combination with our financial plan, helps us behave like adults by creating opportunities to buy low and sell high.         \n\nNow maybe you can see why I\u2019ve previously described diversification and rebalancing as the seventh wonder of the world. It\u2019s not because we can suddenly predict what the market will do next but because we know what  \n need to do next.         \n\nIf you still aren\u2019t convinced, there\u2019s no law saying you can\u2019t dump everything into a single investment. I\u2019ll even wish you luck because you\u2019re going to need it. A single-investment strategy is the investing equivalent of going all in on one spin of the behavioral roulette wheel. I don\u2019t care for those odds myself, particularly since there\u2019s also no law saying that\u2019s the only option open to us.         \n\nPlease don\u2019t be fooled by the headlines and by numbers that reflect a window of time that doesn\u2019t really matter to average investors. I suspect that a well-diversified portfolio is a little bit like what Winston Churchill said about democracy: It\u2019s the worst form of investing except for all the others.
