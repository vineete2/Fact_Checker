{"headline": "Some Retailers Say More About Their Clothing\u2019s Origins", "body": "\nThe revolution that has swept the food industry is expanding to retail: origins matter.         \n\nWith fair-trade coffee and organic fruit now standard on grocery shelves, consumers concerned with working conditions, environmental issues and outsourcing are increasingly demanding similar accountability for their T-shirts. The issue has been brought to the forefront by the garment factory collapse in Bangladesh, which  \n.         \n\nAnd some retailers are doing what was once unthinkable, handing over information about exactly how, and where, their products were made.         \n\nEverlane, an online boutique, last week added paragraphs to its Web site describing the factories where its products are made.         \n\nNordstrom says it is considering adding information about clothes produced in humane working conditions.         \n\nAn online boutique breaks down the number of workers involved in making each item and the cost of every component, while a textiles company intends to trumpet the fair-trade origins of its robes when Bed Bath & Beyond starts selling them this month.         \n\nAnd a group of major retailers and apparel companies, including some \u2014 like Nike and Walmart \u2014 with a history of controversial manufacturing practices overseas, says it is developing an index that will include labor, social and environmental measures.         \n\nNew research indicates a growing consumer demand for information about how and where goods are produced. A study last year by professors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard showed that some consumers \u2014 even those who were focused on discount prices \u2014 were not only willing to pay more, but actually did pay more, for clothes that carried signs about  \n.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s real demand for sweat-free products,\u201d said Ian Robinson, a lecturer and research scientist at the University of Michigan who studies labor issues. Consumers \u201cdon\u2019t have the information they need, and they do care.\u201d         \n\nThe garment factory collapse that killed more than 800 workers in Bangladesh last month has added urgency to the movement, as retailers have seen queries stream in from worried customers.         \n\n\u201cIn the clothing industry, everybody wears it every day, but we have no idea where it comes from,\u201d said Michael Preysman, Everlane\u2019s chief executive and founder. \u201cPeople are starting to slowly clue in to this notion of where products are made.\u201d         \n\nMajor retailers have long balked at disclosing the full trail, saying that sourcing is inherently complex \u2014 a sweater made in Italy may have thread, wool and dye from elsewhere. Another reason: Workplace protections are expensive, and cheap clothes, no matter where or how they are manufactured, still sell, as H&M, Zara and Joe Fresh show through their rapid expansion.         \n\nBut labor advocates note that consumers\u2019 appetite for more information may put competitive pressure on retailers who are less than forthcoming. In recent weeks, government officials, i \n of Germany, and labor and consumer advocates have cited the Bangladesh collapse in calling for the adoption of fair-trade standards or labeling. In direct response to what happened in Bangladesh, Everlane added information to its Web site about the factories where its clothing is made. \u201cThis factory is located 10 minutes from our L.A. office,\u201d  \n reads . \u201cMr. Kim, the owner, has been in the L.A. garment business for over 30 years.\u201d         \n\nEverlane says it will soon add cost breakdowns for all of its clothing, along with photographs of factories where that clothing is made and information about the production.         \n\nMr. Preysman says Everlane has long received questions from customers \u201caround where the products are sourced from and how we can tell that the labor is good.\u201d It is an inexact science, he said. But he added that he looks for factories certified by independent outside organizations and has executives spend time with a factory\u2019s owner to see if he or she \u201cis a decent human being.\u201d         \n\nHonest By, a high-fashion site introduced last year, includes even more specific information about its products. Take  \n that costs about $320: it took 33 minutes to cut, 145 minutes to assemble and 10 minutes to iron at a Belgian factory, then the trim took an additional 10 minutes at a Slovenian plant. The safety pin cost 4 cents, and transportation about $10.50.         \n\nBruno Pieters, the site\u2019s founder, said by e-mail that \u201cas long as we keep paying companies to be unsustainable and unethical, they will be.\u201d But, he said, that may be changing. He cited a spike in sales that he asserted was in response to issues raised by recent overseas sourcing disasters.         \n\nLush Cosmetics, a company based in Britain, has added video from its factories and photographs from buying trips to places like Kenya and Ghana to its Facebook page. Simon Constantine, head perfumer and ethical buyer, said he would like to add links to the factories Lush buys from, to encourage other cosmetics companies to support them.         \n\nNordstrom said it had provided factory information in response to shoppers\u2019 calls, and was considering going a step further, said Tara Darrow, a spokeswoman. The Nordstrom Web site specifies eco-friendly products, \u201cso how can we do the same with people-friendly?\u201d Ms. Darrow asked. \u201cHearing from customers and knowing they care definitely compels us to want to do more.\u201d         \n\nA variety of groups are working on new apparel industry labor standards.
