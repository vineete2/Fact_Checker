{"headline": "Activist\u2019s Death in Egypt Spurs Charges of Police Abuse", "body": "\nCAIRO \u2014 Mohamed el-Gindy spent three days in violent protests around Tahrir Square. In a television interview, he promised a backlash if the new Islamist government tried to recreate the Egyptian police state.         \n\nHe also derided President  \n.         \n\n\u201cWe cannot be threatened, mama\u2019s boy,\u201d Mr. Gindy wrote in a Twitter message.         \n\nA few hours later, Mr. Gindy was found lying in the street, and bleeding from the head; he was dead within a week.         \n\nToday, after nearly three months, Mr. Gindy\u2019s death is a mystery filled with accusations of police brutality, political retaliation, an official cover-up, and a collaboration between the new Islamist leaders and the same security forces that once jailed and beat them.         \n\nHis death has underscored one of the most vexing challenges facing the new government: how to tame  \n\u2019s unaccountable and deeply despised security forces. But it has also raised questions about Mr. Morsi\u2019s commitment to police reform, his willingness to turn a blind eye to the killing of a political opponent, and his fear of conflict with his own Interior Ministry.         \n\nMr. Morsi\u2019s advisers say he supports a \u201cgradual\u201d approach to reforming the security forces. He fears a police revolt at a moment when their services are desperately needed to curb the chaos in the streets enough to stabilize the economy and the political process.         \n\nBut human rights groups and the political opposition warn of a turn back to authoritarianism. Mr. Gindy\u2019s case has become the most notorious example of alleged police abuse since the murder of Khalid Said helped ignite the revolt against Hosni Mubarak more than two years ago. And with the demands for accountability unmet, many activists argue \u2014 echoing Mr. Gindy \u2014 that a failure to rein in the police will only bring more tumult in the streets.         \n\nMr. Gindy was discovered just after 2 a.m. on Jan. 28, lying on his back at the bottom of an exit ramp not far from Tahrir Square and the Egyptian Museum, according to interviews with witnesses and the ambulance crew that found him. Mr. Gindy\u2019s cheeks were dirty, his eyes were bruised, and he was bleeding from gashes above one eye and on his scalp.         \n\nThe son of an affluent family from the city of Tanta, Mr. Gindy, 28, was the trilingual founder of a company selling European tours. He had become a supporter of the leftist opposition leader Hamdeen Sabahy and organized meals for protesters at recent sit-ins at Tahrir Square and the presidential palace, his friends said. As soon as he went missing they suspected he had been abducted by the police.         \n\nHuman rights groups say that around January\u2019s protests dozens of civilians were captured by security police and held for days at police camps on the outskirts of Cairo. The camps were notorious for the abuse of prisoners under former President Hosni Mubarak, and there are signs that the Egyptian police have not abandoned such tactics. During a six-month period last year, at least 10 suspected criminals died in police custody, including at least three who died under torture, said Karim Ennarah, a researcher for the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights.         \n\nUnable to find Mr. Gindy at hospitals, police stations or the morgue, his friends made frantic calls to anyone they knew at the Interior Ministry. The calls brought a torrent of secondhand rumors about his abduction and torture. His family gave tearful interviews on television, the rumors echoed through the Egyptian media, and many are still widely believed. An advocacy group specializing in police abuse, Al Haqaneya, joined the cause. Activists protested for his release in Tahrir Square, outside a security police training camp, and at his hometown\u2019s police headquarters.         \n\nWith information from the town\u2019s police chief, Mr. Gindy was finally located on Jan. 31 at the Cairo hospital where the ambulance had left him. He died there four days later, and, still blaming the police, his family accused Mr. Morsi of murder.         \n\n\u201cI voted for them,\u201d Mr. Gindy\u2019s mother, Samia el-Sheikh, said in a tearful television interview. \u201cIs this the reward? For them to kill my son.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/22/world/middleeast/police-under-new-scrutiny-after-activist-dies-in-egypt.html", "date": "2013-04-21", "description": "The death of Mohamed el-Gindy has underscored one of the most vexing challenges facing the new government: how to tame Egypt\u2019s unaccountable and despised security forces."}
