{"headline": "When the Politicians Who Should Be Helping Are Only Out to Help Themselves", "body": "\nI find Jacqueline Babich sitting on a bench in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, clasping a green bag filled with the detritus of her battle to save her home.         \n\nShe begins to pull out receipts. Here\u2019s the proof she faxed and re-faxed, and mailed and re-mailed, her financial information to her bank. Here\u2019s proof of her income as a schoolteacher. She says the bank keeps losing all of this.         \n\nThen she shows you the photographs of two little boys, who are the loves of her life. \u201cI\u2019m a black single mother and I work from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m.\u201d Her smile is shy and she rolls her large brown eyes. \u201cI\u2019m embarrassed; I made a mistake; I shouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d         \n\nShe grew up in Brooklyn Heights before moving to Brownsville. That sounds like a rough bounce, but it isn\u2019t. Brownsville is a neighborhood filled with hard-working strivers.         \n\nIf only their politicians were their equal.         \n\n \n represents Ms. Babich in the State Senate.  \n sits in Brooklyn\u2019s foreclosure belt, misery found on every block. He moonlights as a foreclosure referee, and stands accused of embezzling $440,000 from New Yorkers who lost their homes.         \n\nHis lawyer, Zachary W. Carter, complains that Mr. Sampson\u2019s alleged misdeeds should not be considered public corruption, as they have nothing to do with his day job in Albany. This is a distinction drained of meaning. If proved guilty, Mr. Sampson picked clean the bones of his neighbors.         \n\nFive miles east of Brownsville, you reach South Ozone Park. That is where the not-so-estimable  \n served as a state senator until she was sentenced to prison last week.         \n\nIn a district overburdened with failing schools, she constructed a butterball turkey of a fake education nonprofit organization. She stuffed it with state dollars, and her supporters \u2014 who doubled as the nonprofit\u2019s officials \u2014 engorged themselves. Ms. Huntley\u2019s lawyer wrote a self-pitying letter to the judge, saying her client took but a few dollars. Ms. Huntley agreed to reimburse taxpayers for $87,000.         \n\nA few black politicians  \n. Prosecutors are picking on them, relying on snitches (Ms. Huntley wore an F.B.I. wire while sipping Zinfandel with nine now deeply uncomfortable former colleagues). State Senator James Sanders Jr. spoke at a forum last week of white \u201cfolks who\u2019ve been in power longer\u201d and are smarter, slicker and perhaps better thieves.         \n\nWhere to begin?         \n\nI once covered Marion Barry, Washington\u2019s crack-smoking mayor. His favorite move, when confronted with evidence of his dysfunctional mayoralty, was to pick at the scab of race. Yet those who suffered most because of his misrule lived on the poorer, black side of that deeply segregated city.         \n\nIn New York, wrongdoing has an ignoble and multicultural lineage. A corrupt conga line extends from Queens, the lair of  \n, to upstate  \n. Brooklyn gave us  \n; the Bronx tossed in  \n and Queens coughed up  \n. Yonkers offered a twofer:  \n and  \n.         \n\nItalian, Irish, Jewish, black, Latino, Chinese, Arab: it\u2019s a gorgeous mosaic of corruption.         \n\nThe legal divisions of the party machines are particularly clever. Years back, Mr. Sampson needed extra money. He turned to his Democratic friends on the Brooklyn Supreme Court bench. The judges tossed him four postings as a foreclosure referee. Two of those judges,  \n, would be forcibly ejected from the bench. Mr. Garson pillaged the estate of his aunt and Mr. Mason dipped into an escrow account.         \n\nMr. Garson is white; Mr. Mason is black. As if that matters.         \n\nMr. Sampson is accused of ripping off these accounts to underwrite his campaign for Brooklyn district attorney in 2005. (The \u201cWhat If\u201d embedded in that last sentence is staggering.)         \n\nBack in Supreme Court, I listen as Ms. Babich explains her predicament: She got pregnant and missed a payment, and now her mortgage is a bus she can\u2019t quite catch. \u201cI\u2019ve put happiness on hold,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to build my life, I know it.\u201d         \n\nShe could use a little guidance, though. She asks if she should talk to a politician; it\u2019s a tough question.         \n\nOn Monday her assemblyman, William F. Boyland Jr., another politician with the wheels coming off, pleaded not guilty to yet another indictment.         \n\nA hard-working woman struggling to save her home deserves much better.
