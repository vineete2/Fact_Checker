{"headline": "Who Made That Catcher\u2019s Mask?", "body": "\nIn the early 1870s, catchers played bare faced. Balls routinely struck their eyes, broke their noses and knocked out their teeth. The danger increased when catchers, who had stood two dozen feet behind the batter, moved closer to the plate \u2014 an innovation, says the baseball historian Peter Morris, \u201cthat allowed the top pitchers to throw their best pitches.\u201d The facial injuries finally decreased when a team from Harvard University rigged up a mask to protect its catchers that resembled a sturdy bird cage. The manager of the team, Frederick Thayer, patented the mask in 1878. Fans hated it. When the Harvard catcher James Tyng stepped onto the field with his head swaddled in steel and leather, he endured jeers from the crowd \u2014 people hooted at the mad dog who had to be \u201cmuzzled.\u201d Editorial writers complained that the innovation detracted from the game. What was next \u2014 a lightning rod to save the catcher from freak storms? Would players limp around the bases with stovepipes on their legs for protection?         \n\nThe debate inspired the sportswriter Henry Chadwick to muse on the true nature of courage. It was strange, he said, that catchers would \u201crun the risk of broken cheek bones, dislocated jaws, a smashed nose or blackened eyes\u201d simply because they were afraid of the \u201cfools\u201d in the crowd. According to Chadwick, a real man would not \u201ctremble before the remarks of small boys.\u201d         \n\nIn the end, what really mattered was that the mask helped win games. \u201cIt changed how the game was played,\u201d Morris says, because pitchers could throw fast and hard at a catcher who wore protection and not worry about causing an injury. \u201cEven if your team didn\u2019t have a great catcher, you could still have a chance to win.\u201d         \n\nThayer also played an aggressive game in the courtroom. When A. G. Spalding & Brothers advertised a $3 catcher\u2019s mask for sale \u2014 without paying him any royalties \u2014 Thayer defended his patent and won. The original Harvard mask is in the National Baseball Hall of Fame.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n When we play 1884 American Association rules, I don\u2019t wear a mask or a chest pad. But you don\u2019t even think about it. You\u2019re just playing the game. You don\u2019t even consider, \u201cHey, the ball\u2019s going to get fouled back in my face.\u201d         \n\n \n Never in the face, but I have been hit in the chest and the arms many times.         \n\n \n If it just hurts and it kind of goes away, then it\u2019s nothing more than a dent or a small bruise. Of course, when you play 1887 rules \u2014 which involves the overhand, fast pitching \u2014 everybody wears a mask. Everybody. The ball is coming too fast.         \n\n \n I wear one made from 12-gauge steel, so it\u2019s a heavy, bowl-shaped mask.         \n\n \n Exactly.         \n\n \n Fingers are the biggest \u2014 jamming or breaking. It has happened to me, and it happens to anybody who plays 19th-century baseball.         \n\n \n Yes. Early on, it was a padded gardening glove. For a catcher, sometimes they\u2019d throw some hay in the palm, a piece of meat, piece of rubber, anything to help ease the force of the ball.
