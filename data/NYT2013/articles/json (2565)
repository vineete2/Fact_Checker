{"headline": "Crafting Couscous: No Grain, No Gain", "body": "\nWhen I visited a small village in northwest Morocco this summer, I was enchanted by the sight of a group of women at a food cooperative, sitting on the floor with their legs outstretched, expertly mixing water with semolina, then raking the grain with their fingers in sweeping circular motions as they prepared couscous from scratch.         \n\nI returned home longing for the fresh wheaty flavor and light steamed texture of homemade couscous, superior to what you get from a box.         \n\nA few weeks later, I found myself in Brooklyn, at the Smorgasburg food market in Williamsburg, where I happened upon a booth emanating the fragrance of fresh couscous and stew. The booth, NYShuk, is operated by Ron Arazi and his wife, Leetal, chefs from Israel who run a company showcasing Jewish Middle Eastern food. Through them I learned how simple and satisfying it is to make your own couscous.         \n\nAll it takes is some semolina, a little water, a strainer and a steamer. Once you have practiced it a few times to pick up the knack, it is easy, even magical. Not to mention a showstopping addition to the table at Rosh Hashana, which is early this year, beginning Sept. 4.         \n\n\u201cMaking couscous is not hard,\u201d said Mr. Arazi, 32. \u201cBut it is labor intensive. For Leetal and me, couscous is craftsmanship. We are losing the battle of making it to industrial processed couscous.\u201d         \n\nThe two (she is 28) met while working as cooks in the Tel Aviv kitchen of Herbert Samuel, one of Israel\u2019s top restaurants. Thinking good home cooking from Israel (not the typical hummus and falafel) was missing here, they relocated to spread the word and their cuisine, joining the ranks of a growing number of young chefs from Israel in recent years.         \n\n\u201cWe are actually trying to show another layer of Israeli cuisine, from Morocco, Turkey, and other places,\u201d Mr. Arazi said. \u201cWe feel it is a shame that no one knows what it\u2019s about.\u201d         \n\nHe learned to make couscous from his mother, who was born in Mogador, now Essaouira, a town in Morocco once known for its expert couscous makers. \u201cI, the only son in my family, love to preach about it,\u201d he said. \u201cMy sisters never made couscous in their life.\u201d         \n\nMr. Arazi taught me how to make couscous in the kitchen of his Crown Heights apartment. Watching him work with his hands was mesmerizing. He put about four cups of semolina in a large mixing bowl, and dampened it by spraying it with water. Holding the bowl in his left hand, he patted and circled his fingers gently over the semolina until the grain started to clump into tiny balls. Then he steamed it over water.         \n\n\u201cMoroccan Jewish cooks always steam couscous over a stew,\u201d he said, but \u201cthen you can\u2019t taste the natural wheaty flavor of the semolina.\u201d Transferring the couscous to a mesh sieve, he gently shook the grains through. Soon it was ready for a little salt and some oil, then it went back into the steamer, covered this time.         \n\nAs it steamed, he put the last touches on roast lamb shanks with caramelized onions and tanzeya, a preserve of dried fruits like prunes, apricots and figs, a Jewish Moroccan dish served for Rosh Hashana.         \n\n\u201cFood like this gives you sasson and simcha \u2014 happiness and joy \u2014 something you need for the New Year,\u201d he said.
