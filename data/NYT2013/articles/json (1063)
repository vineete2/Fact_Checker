{"headline": "Fed to Start Unwinding Its Stimulus Next Month", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve said on Wednesday that it would gradually end its bond-buying program during 2014, a modest first step toward unwinding the central bank\u2019s broader stimulus campaign as its officials gain confidence that the economy is growing steadily.         \n\nThe Fed plans to cut its monthly purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities from $85 billion in December to nothing by the end of next year in a series of small steps, starting with a reduction to $75 billion in January, the central bank announced after a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee.         \n\nAt the same time, the Fed sought to offset concerns that it was once again pulling back too soon by strengthening its plans to hold short-term interest rates near zero, which officials regard as a more powerful means of stimulating growth. Both policies aim to hold down borrowing costs and revive risk-taking.         \n\nThe Fed\u2019s shift in policy, in effect, means it plans to do less now and more later. That is a result of a compromise that has been months in the making between a group of officials convinced that the economy needs more help, and a range of internal critics who regarded the bond-buying campaign as ineffective or dangerous.         \n\nThe Fed\u2019s chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, insisted that the net effect was not a withdrawal of support for the economy.         \n\n\u201cWe are not doing less,\u201d he said at a news conference on Wednesday. \u201cI think we have been aggressive to try to keep the economy growing, and we are seeing progress in the labor market. I would dispute the idea that we are not providing a lot of accommodation to the economy.\u201d         \n\nInvestors appeared to agree with Mr. Bernanke, defying predictions that stock prices would retreat along with the Fed\u2019s pullback. Major stock indexes spiked when the Fed\u2019s statement was released at 2 p.m., and the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rose 1.7 percent by the end of the trading day. Importantly, interest rates on benchmark bonds \u2014 the rates the Fed is trying to influence \u2014 ended the day roughly where they started.         \n\nOne reason for investor enthusiasm, said Michael Hanson, senior economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, is the stimulus will be withdrawn very gradually.         \n\nThe markets now have a clear \u2014 though tentative \u2014 schedule for the course of Fed policy over the next two years, including an end to asset purchases by late next year and a signal from Mr. Bernanke that the first increase in short-term interest rates is not likely to come until near the end of 2015.         \n\nThat is particularly striking because the plan, set in the final months of Mr. Bernanke\u2019s tenure, will now define the first two years of the term of his successor, Janet Yellen, whom the Senate is expected to confirm this week. Mr. Bernanke said on Wednesday that Ms. Yellen \u201cfully supports what we did today.\u201d         \n\nThe Fed is struggling to calibrate its stimulus campaign in an environment of steady but mediocre growth. The unemployment rate has declined over the last year, reaching 7 percent in November. But that is still a high rate by historical standards, and other measures of the labor market look even worse. Wages are rising slowly, and the share of adults with jobs has not climbed since the recession.         \n\nA variety of indicators suggest the American economy may now be growing more quickly than analysts predicted, and Fed officials anticipate somewhat faster growth in the coming year. But the persistence of low inflation indicates the economy is operating well below its capacity.         \n\nPrices increased only 0.7 percent during the 12 months ending in October, according to a Commerce Department index that is the Fed\u2019s preferred gauge of inflation, well below the 2 percent pace the Fed considers healthy. Economic projections by Fed officials, also published on Wednesday, showed that the officials did not expect inflation to exceed 2 percent in the next three years.
