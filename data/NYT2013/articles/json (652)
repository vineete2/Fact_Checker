{"headline": "Who Made That Turn Signal?", "body": "\n\u201cA car to me is something that is almost human, something that responds to kindness and understanding and care, just as people do,\u201d the actress Florence Lawrence told a reporter in 1920, when driving had become a symbol of women\u2019s liberation. \u201cThe average woman does her own repairing. She is curious enough to investigate every little creak and squak of her car, and to remedy it.\u201d Lawrence herself addressed more than squaks: in 1914, she developed an early version of the turn signal. \u201cI have invented an \u2018auto-signaling arm,\u2019 which, when placed on the back of the fender, can be raised or lowered by electrical push buttons,\u201d she told The Green Book Magazine. \u201cThe one indicating \u2018stop\u2019 works automatically whenever the foot brake is pressed.\u201d         \n\nLawrence, whose mother patented a \u201ccleaning device\u201d for windshields in 1918, never patented her own invention and has been largely forgotten in the annals of auto history. As it happens, she has also been forgotten as arguably the first film star. \u201cShe\u2019s the beginning of Hollywood,\u201d Kelly Brown, Lawrence\u2019s only biographer, said. \u201cThe star system, you can trace it back to these original ads that she was in.\u201d         \n\nThe \u201cBiograph Girl,\u201d as she was known, based on her work with the film company, wasn\u2019t the very first person to come up with a turn signal. In 1909, a British man named Percy Douglas-Hamilton patented a set of hands, one attached to each side of the car, which could be illuminated to indicate a coming turn. \u201cPeople look at and cite that patent\u201d as the first, said John Heitmann, a professor at the University of Dayton who specializes in automobile history. \u201cBut nothing happened.\u201d He added that it would be \u201chighly unlikely\u201d that Lawrence knew about it. More patents followed \u2014 in 1925, Edgar Walz Jr. patented a light with two arrows and a brake light; in the late \u201930s, Joseph Bell patented the first electrical device that flashed \u2014 and then in 1939, Buick introduced turn signals as a standard feature. Still, electrical turn signals didn\u2019t become widespread until the early to mid-1950s. Before then, a host of makeshift and accessory devices, as well as hand signals, sufficed.         \n\nWe might not owe the turn signal to Lawrence, but her place in auto history points to something larger. \u201cWe always see the automobile as a masculine object, but in fact,\u201d Heitmann said, \u201cwomen played an active role in thinking about the automobile. That\u2019s where, I think, Florence Lawrence really stands out.\u201d Or, in Lawrence\u2019s own words: \u201cThere are as many women driving cars as men. And infinitely better drivers they make too.\u201d         \n\n\u00a0         \n\n \n         \n\n \n.         \n\n \nThere was a turn signal called the Wig Wag, from the \u201920s. It was a pendulum that could attach to anywhere you wanted, and I think it was an arrow pointing down that would rotate back and forth.         \n\n \nThat\u2019s correct. You have to remember that at that point, there were hardly any cars on the road anyway.         \n\n \nYeah, absolutely. We were taught that early in driver\u2019s ed, and I\u2019ve had a lot of early brass-era cars that had no turn signals, so my arm\u2019s gotta do the right thing.         \n\n \nToday? No way.        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/magazine/who-made-that-turn-signal.html", "date": "2013-07-12", "description": "The invention of the \u201cauto-signaling arm.\u201d"}
