{"headline": "For the Want of Real Leaders, N.F.L. Culture Will Stay Lost", "body": "\nBy now we know what Richie Incognito is accused of doing to his  \n teammate Jonathan Martin. Name-calling. Bullying. Threats. What we don\u2019t know is the truth of what happened between them, or who is going to fix the cruel locker room culture that the situation has exposed.         \n\nWe\u2019ll have time to ponder possible solutions when, in an extreme case of bad luck for the  \n, the Dolphins play the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on \u201cMonday Night Football.\u201d That game will showcase the league\u2019s two most dysfunctional teams.         \n\nThe Bucs are winless. Their players are ready to mutiny against their unpopular coach, Greg Schiano. Staph infections have swept through their locker room this season. Despite all that, the Dolphins would probably give anything to trade places with the Bucs right now. After all, there are proven remedies to the Bucs\u2019 problems. Win a game. Replace the coach. Disinfect the locker room. Move on.         \n\nThe Dolphins\u2019 case is much more complicated.         \n\n \n, the league\u2019s commissioner, has promised to get to the bottom of the Incognito-Martin situation. He hired what he called an independent investigator to learn the details, to uncover who knew what and when, and to find out how a player had come to feel so bullied that he left the team. Goodell would also want to know how it all could happen under the watch of coaches who often make it their business to know what\u2019s going on in the locker room.         \n\nGiven the investigator\u2019s findings, Goodell should be able to create rules to prevent a similar situation from happening again. If bullying is found, he should be aggressive about making changes, if only to protect the league\u2019s brand. But will he? And if he does, when?         \n\nLook at this quotation from Goodell: \u201cWe are changing the culture of our game for the better.\u201d Sounds good, right? But he didn\u2019t say that last week, or even in the last month. He said it in 2009 during  \n as the league was being pummeled for its denials about football-related concussions. It took the N.F.L. years even to acknowledge that  \n posed a serious problem for its sport, and that was an issue dealing with life and death. So perhaps people should think twice about putting their trust in Goodell this time around, in trying to fix this problem that upon first glance seems ingrained in the league\u2019s culture.         \n\nLooking to Dolphins coaches probably won\u2019t help much, either. They can\u2019t win here. Coach Joe Philbin should be blamed for encouraging aggressive behavior or turning a blind eye to it. If neither he nor his staff had any idea that Martin was feeling cornered by Incognito \u2014 which is a long shot, since coaches often have spies within the team to monitor team chemistry \u2014 those coaches should be blamed for their ignorance.         \n\nAnd don\u2019t expect Stephen Ross, the 73-year-old billionaire owner, to change a thing to bring more professionalism to his team\u2019s locker room. He\u2019s not around nearly as much as the owner Jerry Jones is with the Dallas Cowboys, and look how well Jones has kept his team under control. Less than two months after a Cowboy died after a teammate drove drunk, yet another Cowboy was charged with drunken driving early this year. So much for lessons learned.         \n\nUnfortunately, there is only one sure way to rid a locker room of racial discrimination, bullying, extortion or whatever hazing-gone-bad the Dolphins may be guilty of \u2014 and that is to change the team\u2019s locker room culture from the inside out. That would mean the players have to get on board. And that includes those players who came to Incognito\u2019s defense. They called him a leader, a funny guy whose actions were just part of a team\u2019s fabric.         \n\nBut that\u2019s expected. It\u2019s what teams do, even in the face of a teammate\u2019s bad behavior. Teams stand as one, bound by the same toughness and togetherness that Incognito was supposedly instilling in Martin. Teams tend to stay true to that code of brotherhood, even if it taints their reputation or possibly hurts others.         \n\nRemember when Alex Rodriguez apologized in 2009 for doping? His Yankee teammates didn\u2019t speak up or urge Major League Baseball to punish him more severely. No, they just sat stone-faced at Rodriguez\u2019s news conference and listened to an admitted cheat. Good guy Derek Jeter, the longtime team captain, was front and center in the audience to show his support, even though Rodriguez\u2019s confession tainted him and every other player in the game. In baseball, it was called having Rodriguez\u2019s back.
