{"headline": "Next Option for Yankees: To Spend (Gasp!)", "body": "\nBOSTON \u2014 Three players represented the  \n at the All-Star festivities this week at Citi Field. One, Mariano Rivera, is retiring. Another, Robinson Cano, is facing free agency. The last, Rafael De Paula, who pitched in the Futures Game, is in Class A. So if it pains Yankees fans to think about this season, the long-term future does not seem much better.         \n\nThe immediate future is daunting enough. The Yankees on Friday began a stretch of 10 games against the Boston Red Sox, the Texas Rangers and the Tampa Bay Rays, three of the five American League teams that would qualify for the playoffs based on first-half standings. The Yankees remain significantly undermanned, as they showed again Friday in a 4-2 loss at Fenway Park.         \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t project where we\u2019ll be in two and a half weeks,\u201d General Manager  \n said before the game. \u201cI just know that right now we\u2019re interested in adding and reinforcing and getting better. We know we\u2019re going to get better when guys get back, but we still need to improve ourselves in the short term.\u201d         \n\nThe Yankees are so thin that their No. 5 hitter for a game against the first-place Red Sox was Zoilo Almonte, who had a month of major league experience. And they are so snakebit that Almonte ended the night on crutches, headed for the disabled list with a sprained left ankle.         \n\n\u201cYou just deal with it,\u201d Manager Joe Girardi said. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to feel sorry for us.\u201d         \n\nEven when players return this season, they tend to land right back on the disabled list. It happened with Curtis Granderson and Mark Teixeira, and it happened again on Friday when the Yankees shut down Derek Jeter with a strained quadriceps.         \n\nBrent Lillibridge, who replaced Jeter on the active roster, became the 45th player the Yankees have used this season. If Alex Rodriguez returns on Monday in Texas, as scheduled, the Yankees will have used more players this season than they did in all of 2012.         \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t ever like to use injuries as an excuse; I think Boston was hit with a lot of injuries last year,\u201d Jeter said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to deal with it. You\u2019ve got to move on. But I\u2019d be lying to you if I said it wasn\u2019t kind of odd the way things have been happening. We get guys back, they get hurt again. The number of guys is something that I haven\u2019t seen here since I\u2019ve been here. But other teams have to deal with it, too.\u201d         \n\nCashman could fortify the offense with a trade, in theory, but good hitters are hard to find. With the July 31 trade deadline approaching, the most significant position player to be traded has been Scott Hairston, from the Chicago Cubs to the Washington Nationals. Hairston was hitting .172 at the time.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an offensive offensive market,\u201d Cashman said, wryly, before waiting a few beats for the joke to connect. \u201cPeople could say they\u2019re offended by my offense, too. So we\u2019re all even.\u201d         \n\nThe Yankees have allowed four more runs than they have scored, suggesting that they should be below .500, instead of six games over. By now, the record seems like a mirage. The Yankees last held first place alone in the A.L. East on May 25. Since then, they are 21-27.         \n\n \n \u2014 the oldest starting pitcher in the majors, at 41 \u2014 allowed four runs in six and a third innings. He has a 5.04 earned run average in nine starts since early June, when he returned from a back injury. He did not pitch badly on Friday, but again took too long to find a rhythm.         \n\n\u201cThis ain\u2019t easy,\u201d Pettitte said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough lineup. Those guys are good over there. They can hit the ball. You\u2019re trying to battle as best you can.\u201d         \n\nPettitte has pitched admirably, considering his age, but the Yankees do not know his plans. If he stays mired in mediocrity, coming back for 2014 may not be so appealing to him. But for now Pettitte is optimistic.         \n\n\u201cEarly on, right now, it\u2019s just not going the way I want it to out there,\u201d Pettitte said. \u201cIt\u2019ll turn.\u201d         \n\nHiroki Kuroda, the Yankees\u2019 best starter this season, will be 39 in February and is also at a stage where he prefers one-year contracts. So the Yankees may need to rely on Michael Pineda, a former Seattle All-Star, which seems for now like a risky bet. Pineda is stuck in Class AAA with a rebuilt shoulder and just 141/3 innings in three starts.         \n\nThe Yankees do have roughly $100 million in expiring contracts, but Cano will get a chunk to return and the team has vowed to keep its payroll below $189 million to reset its luxury tax rate. The corollary to executing the plan, though, is that the Yankees must believe they can still field a title contender. A poor second half \u2014 and the absence of high-impact, low-cost prospects to fill in \u2014 could easily change everything.         \n\nRemember, the last time the Yankees missed the playoffs, in 2008, they reacted by spending $423.5 million on free-agent contracts for Teixeira, C. C. Sabathia and A. J. Burnett. That spending led immediately to a championship.         \n\nThe Yankees\u2019 business model depends on must-see superstars and the hope, or expectation, of October glory. If this season ends in Houston on Sept. 29, the Yankees cannot market themselves as a reigning playoff team. They cannot promote exciting young prospects and broken-down veterans, either. They may have no choice but to spend big.
