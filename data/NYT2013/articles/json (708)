The table was in the lower level of Toronto\u2019s Art Gallery of Ontario, part of a children\u2019s art center where we could deposit my son for a convenient half-hour. Some administrator at the gallery is obviously a genius: it\u2019s clear to me now that every art gallery in the world should have some means available for playing table tennis. Hitting little white balls with miniature paddles over a waist-high table turns out to be the perfect conclusion to a day spent looking at paintings with rambunctious children in tow.         \n\nMy father and I knew the terms. First to 21. Win by two points. Best of three games. We started right in, without warm-up. Immediately I knew I was going to beat him. My spin serves devastated with their cleverness. My smashes were paralyzing, my defenses impenetrable. I took the opener 21-9. The second game 21-6. I crushed him; an official drubbing.         \n\nMy father blamed his recent eye operations, which diminished his depth perception.         \n\n\u201cYou beat a one-eyed man,\u201d he said.         \n\nTo me, the idea that my father was blaming health for his defeat was absurd. He went to the gym the day before, and he looked fitter than any 64-year-old man had a right to be.         \n\n\u201cYou can still drive, can\u2019t you?\u201d I asked.         \n\n\u201cYes.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a poor workman who blames his tools,\u201d I concluded, and spent much of the remaining afternoon gloating.         \n\n \n my father died of a pulmonary embolism. He had received a diagnosis of lymphoma, but even so, this swift and sudden death was completely unexpected, a turn that nobody, least of all himself, expected.         \n\nCould I even name all the games we played together in a lifetime of competitions? Old maid, crazy eights, cribbage, mah-jongg, checkers, chess, nine men\u2019s morris, oh hell, backgammon, Risk, Monopoly, not to mention the many minor competitions, too many to name, that were just part of the routine. Who could find the most spelling mistakes on a menu in a restaurant? Who could name the band and the song on the radio first? All the little races up the stairs of so many hotels. Competition, against each other and against the world, was one primary way we connected.         \n\nShortly after the funeral, one of my cousins brought me a Polaroid photo he had held onto. It was a snapshot of my father, younger at the time of the photograph than I am now, playing mah-jongg while wearing a T-shirt that read, in glittering, round \u201970s typography: \u201cI\u2019m good. I\u2019m really good. Damn I\u2019m good.\u201d         \n\nIf you asked his nephews how they remembered my father, \u201ccompetitive\u201d might well be the first adjective on their lips. When he wanted to lose weight in middle age, his diet strategy was to make a wager with his brother over who could lose the most weight in three months. My uncle won, by a pound.         \n\nI have inherited my father\u2019s competitiveness, without a doubt. Not that I feel the trait is a personal strength. My competitive instincts have mainly been a scourge rather than a benefit, leading to screaming matches with friends over basketball games and writerly envy, the world\u2019s most pointless emotion. Gore Vidal\u2019s famous quote, that \u201cwhenever a friend succeeds, a little something in me dies,\u201d is an ancient and common emotion for writers. What\u2019s especially pointless about this brand of competitiveness is that, unlike table tennis, it\u2019s impossible for one person to \u201cwin.\u201d Yet now writerly success has been publicly quantified in a way that allows direct daily competition \u2014 Facebook likes, retweets, page views, page read-throughs, position on the most-e-mailed list. It\u2019s impossible to turn away from the numbers, even though they are so obviously a path to idiocy: care too much about them, and you\u2019ll wake up one day to find yourself writing \u201c27 cats who look like members of the royal family.\u201d Competitiveness leads to an unhealthful narrowing of vision, at least for me. What could be more toxic to the business of writing than that brand of narrowing?
