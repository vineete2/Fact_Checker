{"headline": "Same-Sex Couples Are Urged to Apply for Social Security Spousal Benefits", "body": "\nThe Internal Revenue Service recently decided that for same-sex couples filing federal income taxes, married means married \u2014 regardless of where you and your spouse live. The Social Security Administration, however, hasn\u2019t officially come to the same determination yet regarding potentially valuable spousal benefits.         \n\nThe agency says it is studying the applicable law with the Justice Department. But it is urging same-sex couples to apply for benefits anyway \u2014 even if they live in a state that doesn\u2019t recognize their marriage.         \n\nWhat\u2019s more, the agency also is inviting applications not just from those in same-sex marriages, but also those in other legal same-sex relationships, like civil unions or registered domestic partnerships.         \n\nApplying as soon as possible is important, because if you are ultimately found eligible, you can get benefits retroactive to your filing date.         \n\n\u201cIn the coming weeks and months, we will develop and implement additional policy and processing instructions,\u201d the message says. \u201cIf you are in a same-sex marriage or other legal same-sex relationship, even if you live in a state that prohibits same-sex marriage, we encourage you to apply right away.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s huge,\u201d said Mary Bonauto, civil rights project director with the Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders (GLAD) in Boston.         \n\nSocial Security offers a range of financial benefits for spouses and families. You can file for retirement benefits based on your spouse\u2019s work record, for instance, which entitles you to more money if your spouse earned more than you, or to delay tapping your own benefits.         \n\nYou can also receive \u201csurviving spouse\u201d benefits after your spouse dies. For example, you can receive a one-time payment of $255. And you can get your deceased spouse\u2019s higher retirement payout instead of your own.         \n\nThe Social Security Administration\u2019s Web site says it is now processing some spousal retirement claims and paying them when due. If you and your spouse live in a state where same-sex marriage is sanctioned, and you meet other criteria (see below), the application should be straightforward. An unresolved question, however, is whether couples who were legally married in one state but moved to another state that doesn\u2019t recognize gay marriage can get the same benefits. That\u2019s because the Social Security Administration currently uses a \u201cplace of residence\u201d standard in deciding spousal benefits.         \n\nSusan Sommer, senior counsel with the gay rights group Lambda Legal, said Social Security had instructed its staff to accept and hold such applications, pending further legal clarification. \u201cWe\u2019re awaiting guidance, and we\u2019re really hopeful,\u201d she said.         \n\nThe agency also is holding other types of applications for now, like those for survivor benefits when one spouse dies. However, Ms. Bonauto said she was encouraged by the case of 83-year-old Herb Burtis, a musician and voice teacher in Western Massachusetts. Mr. Burtis had applied for survivor benefits after his husband died in 2008. (They married in 2004, when Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriage). His late husband\u2019s monthly retirement benefits were $700 higher because he had earned more than Mr. Burtis, and Mr. Burtis filed a claim for the extra payment. His application was initially denied. But he became a plaintiff in a lawsuit that successfully challenged the Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA, which was struck down in June by the United States Supreme Court. He is now getting the extra money, and also received a lump-sum payment for the last five years.         \n\nMs. Bonauto said there was \u201cevery reason to expect\u201d that the agency would eventually process and pay survivor benefits to other eligible same-sex applicants.         \n\nHere are some questions to consider:         \n\n\u25a0  \n         \n\nYou must meet certain criteria. For instance, to receive spousal retirement benefits, you generally must be at least 62 and have been married for at least 12 months; for the survivor\u2019s benefit, you must be at least 60 and have been married for nine months. If you meet age and duration requirements, Ms. Bonauto said, you should apply for benefits, even in the face of other uncertainties.         \n\n\u25a0  \n         \n\nYou can apply online at \nforspousal retirement benefits. But you must apply for survivor\u2019s benefits by calling or visiting a local Social Security office; make an appointment before you go. GLAD advises you to bring a copy of your marriage license, or your civil union or domestic partnership certificate, and a copy of your spouse\u2019s death certificate.         \n\n\u25a0  \n         \n\nContact the regional communications director for your state.
