{"headline": "China Plans to Reduce the State\u2019s Role in the Economy", "body": "\nSHANGHAI \u2014 The Chinese government is planning for private businesses and market forces to play a larger role in its economy, in a major policy shift intended to improve living conditions for the middle class and to make China an even stronger competitor on the global stage.         \n\nIn a speech to party cadres containing some of the boldest pro-market rhetoric they have heard in more than a decade, the country\u2019s new prime minister, Li Keqiang, said this month that the central government would reduce the state\u2019s role in economic matters in the hope of unleashing the creative energies of a nation with the world\u2019s second-largest economy after that of the United States.         \n\nOn Friday, the Chinese government issued a set of policy proposals that seemed to show that Mr. Li and other leaders were serious about reducing government intervention in the marketplace and giving competition among private businesses a bigger role in investment decisions and setting prices. Whether Beijing can restructure an economy that is thoroughly addicted to state credit and government directives is unclear. But analysts see such announcements as the strongest signs yet that top policy makers are serious about revamping the nation\u2019s growth model.         \n\n\u201cThis is radical stuff, really,\u201d said Stephen Green, an economist at the British bank Standard Chartered and an expert on the Chinese economy. \u201cPeople have talked about this for a long time, but now we\u2019re getting a clearly spoken reform agenda from the top.\u201d         \n\nChina\u2019s leaders are under greater pressure to change as growth slows and the limitations of its state-led, investment-driven economy are becoming more evident. This month, manufacturing activity contracted for the first time in seven months, according to an independent survey by HSBC. Economists are lowering their growth forecasts and weighing the risks associated with high levels of corporate and government debt that have built up over the last five years.         \n\n\u201cThere are quite a number of messages coming from these new leaders,\u201d said Huang Yiping, chief economist for emerging Asia at the British bank Barclays. \u201cThey realize that if we continue to delay reforms, the economy could be in deep trouble.\u201d         \n\nThe broad proposals include expanding a tax on natural resources, taking gradual steps to allow market forces to determine bank interest rates and developing policies to \u201cpromote the effective entry of private capital into finance, energy, railways, telecommunications and other spheres,\u201d according to  \n issued on the government\u2019s Web site. \u201cAll of society is ardently awaiting new breakthroughs in reform,\u201d the directive said.         \n\nForeign investors will be given more opportunities to invest in finance, logistics, health care and other sectors. For years, Western governments, banks and companies have complained that the China government has impeded foreign investment in banking and other service industries, despite promising to open up. The latest directive, however, did not give details about the specific changes to foreign investment rules that policy makers in Beijing have in mind.         \n\nChina\u2019s leaders are also promising to loosen foreign exchange controls, changes that are likely to reduce price distortions in the economy and allow the market to determine the value of the Chinese currency, the renminbi. On Friday, the central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, issued a statement that repeated such vows.         \n\nThe push does not signal the end of big government in China. The Communist Party, experts say, is unlikely to abandon the state capitalist model, break up huge, state-run oligopolies or privatize major sectors of the economy that the party considers strategic, like banking, energy and telecommunications.         \n\nBeijing seems to be pressing ahead because it has few alternatives. The economy has slowed this year because of fewer exports to Europe and the United States and slower investment growth. Rising labor costs and a strengthening currency have also reduced manufacturing competitiveness.         \n\nChina\u2019s leaders, including a group of pro-market bureaucrats who seem to have gained in the leadership shuffle this year, seem to think that more government spending could worsen economic conditions and that the private sector needs to step in.
