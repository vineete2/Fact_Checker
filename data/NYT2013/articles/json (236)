{"headline": "The Sizable Shadow That Won\u2019t Leave the Yankees", "body": "\nWhen  \n squeezed the final out of the  \n\u2019 last championship, in 2009, he bolted across the diamond from first base. Teixeira would say later he had no plan for the celebration; he just took off, a spontaneous expression of joy. He was not trying to run toward  \n.         \n\nSomehow, though, it made perfect sense that he did. From the moment he was welcomed into professional baseball, 20 years ago this week as the first overall pick in the amateur draft, Rodriguez has exerted a magnetic pull like no other player. As Rodriguez has said, in so many words, it always comes back to him.         \n\nRodriguez is a ghostly presence around these Yankees, spending spring training and almost all of the regular season away from the team, recovering from another hip operation. His teammates had to answer for him Wednesday anyway, because Rodriguez was big news again.         \n\nRodriguez has been linked to a shuttered  \n whose owner, Anthony Bosch, has agreed to cooperate with Major League Baseball\u2019s investigators. The league could pursue suspensions for Bosch\u2019s clients, and while other stars, like Ryan Braun of the Milwaukee Brewers, may also be vulnerable, no one shines like Rodriguez.         \n\nTo the Yankees, his glow is more like an overhead fluorescent light, constantly buzzing and lasting forever. If baseball can prove that Rodriguez did, indeed, have another dalliance with banned substances, he may not have much support in the clubhouse.         \n\nThe Yankees  \n, when he admitted to using banned drugs before baseball began testing with penalties. The landscape has changed now, and Tuesday\u2019s revelation, by ESPN, that more than 20 players could face 100-game suspensions is a deeper stain on the game.         \n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s embarrassing,\u201d Teixeira said, speaking generally about the report. \u201cThis is all speculation, but if it is true, then I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good for the game. We\u2019re supposed to be good examples for kids, for fans. It\u2019d be one thing if we didn\u2019t have a policy. We\u2019ve had a very tough policy for a long time. If that many guys are still cheating, it\u2019s just very disappointing.\u201d         \n\nTeixeira was the Yankees\u2019 best player in 2009, but Rodriguez was their most indelible, especially when it mattered most. A postseason failure before and since for the Yankees, Rodriguez owned that fall, hitting .365 with 6 homers and 18 runs batted in.         \n\nThe championship was Rodriguez\u2019s gift to the Yankees, the contribution that makes it impossible to dismiss the 10-year, $275 million contract that runs through 2017. Yes, the Yankees should have let Rodriguez leave and traded, say, Austin Jackson and Joba Chamberlain to the Marlins for Miguel Cabrera. But they cannot go back. At least they could save millions if Rodriguez ever does serve a 100-game ban.         \n\nThe notion of voiding the remaining contract, because of performance-enhancers, still seems far-fetched; Jason Giambi was in town this week with the Cleveland Indians, as if to underscore the point. Giambi did not make himself available Wednesday to lend perspective on the latest drug maelstrom. His manager, Terry Francona, said it best anyway.         \n\n\u201cAs an industry, we buried our heads in the sand a little bit, and now we\u2019re paying the price for it,\u201d Francona said. \u201cI certainly think what we have in place right now is very good. We\u2019re trying very hard to make our game as good as it can be.\u201d         \n\nThe Yankees who spoke after  \n offered support for Rodriguez, whatever that means. Brett Gardner said Rodriguez was like a brother, and Mariano Rivera called him a friend.         \n\nYet Rivera \u2014 humble and classy, with a well-earned reputation for integrity \u2014 stands for everything Rodriguez is not. Rivera said he had not spoken with his friend in a while, and the Bosch topic is taboo.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I would be the one to ask,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cIf he wanted to share with me \u2014 but I don\u2019t think I would start a conversation about something like that.\u201d         \n\nFair enough; the daily grind of a season is plenty for most players to worry about. But ignoring the bigger picture, as Francona said, had disastrous consequences before, and players like Teixeira want to keep pressing the issue. Aggressively pursuing the suspects, he said, is not enough. \u201cJust because you have police, that\u2019s good \u2014 but crime\u2019s not good, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Teixeira said. \u201cWe\u2019re breaking the rules here. You just don\u2019t want to see it.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never going to get out of the game. You\u2019re always going to have cheaters. In every walk of life, people are going to cheat at whatever they do. That\u2019s unfortunate, but we should expect more out of ourselves. We really should. There\u2019s no excuse for it. In the late \u201990s and early 2000s, you could claim ignorance. You can\u2019t claim ignorance anymore. There\u2019s no place for it.\u201d         \n\nTeixeira was drafted in 2001, the year Barry Bonds blasted 73 home runs to break Mark McGwire\u2019s record of 70. It was all a mirage, and for Teixeira, it offended his basic sense of fair play.         \n\n\u201cYou knew it was going on; you had to be really na\u00efve to think that stuff was natural,\u201d Teixeira said. \u201cAs a fan, everyone was turning a blind eye to it. Now, once I got into pro baseball, I made a conscious decision that I was never going to do that.         \n\n\u201cWould my numbers be better if I did? Probably. Would I be able to hold my head up high and look at kids in the eye? No. It\u2019s much more important for me to be able to look people in the eye and say I did it right than to have a couple of M.V.P.\u2019s and have a few more home runs at the end of my career.\u201d         \n\nTeixeira was active in the union in the early years of steroid testing, when the players agreed to increase penalties. He said he was open to doing so again.         \n\n\u201cWe need to figure out what that right equation is,\u201d Teixeira said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is \u2014 I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll have more discussions \u2014 but we can\u2019t have guys trying to beat the system.\u201d         \n\nOne of those guys just might be the man Teixeira raced toward on that triumphant night in 2009. It was the moment that should have defined Rodriguez\u2019s career, but never will.
