{"headline": "\u2018There\u2019s No Genius More Unknown Than the One Who Never Was\u2019", "body": "\nYou\u2019ve probably never heard of the movie that I\u2019m most excited to see this summer. It\u2019s titled \u201cThumbscrew,\u201d and was directed by a shadowy auteur named Stanislas Cordova, a secretive genius whose dark art films are intensely studied by rabid fans known as Cordovites. \u201cThumbscrew\u201d is about a woman who suspects her college-professor husband might be murdering young boys, and by all available accounts, it\u2019s one serious creepfest. According to one person who has seen it, \u201cThumbscrew\u201d is \u201can ominous tale of suspicion, paranoia, marriage and the inscrutability of the human psyche.\u201d Cordova\u2019s extensive filmography is so unnerving that there\u2019s even speculation about whether his movies capture actual crimes rather than staged acts of violence.         \n\nPerhaps you\u2019re now as intrigued as I am. Well, too bad for both of us. Because \u201cThumbscrew\u201d will not be coming soon to a theater near you. It won\u2019t be making the film-festival rounds, nor will it be available on iTunes, Netflix or DVD. In fact, it doesn\u2019t exist. The film \u2014 along with Cordova\u2019s entire oeuvre and, for that matter, Cordova himself \u2014 was dreamed up by the author Marisha Pessl for her forthcoming novel, \u201cNight Film\u201d (out Aug. 20).         \n\nThe inconvenient fact that Cordova is entirely fictional has not prevented me from getting strangely hooked on his work. Having finished \u201cNight Film,\u201d I now find myself a dedicated Cordovite, desperate to hunt down excellently titled obscurities like \u201cAt Night All Birds Are Black\u201d and \u201cFigures Bathed in Light.\u201d But unless some brave, innovative movie studio decides to shoot adaptations of \u201cNight Film\u201d and \u201cThumbscrew\u201d for simultaneous release (are you listening, brave, innovative movie studios?), Cordova\u2019s films will forever remain in the realm of the imagination. Perhaps this suggests some undiagnosed O.C.D. tendencies, but I\u2019m truly disappointed not to be able to plunk down an obscene amount of cash on a nicely packaged Criterion Collection Cordova DVD box set that could live on my shelves right next to \u201cC.H.U.D.\u201d and \u201cThe Conversation.\u201d         \n\n \n and it happens to me more often than you might think. I\u2019m constantly falling for cultural artifacts that clever authors have cooked up for their novels. I become invested in these made-up movies and songs and books much the way I do with well-crafted characters \u2014 and I\u2019m similarly sad to part with them when I finish the last chapter.         \n\nI have fallen for the novels of the German cult writer Benno von Archimboldi (\u201cBifurcaria Bifurcata,\u201d \u201cThe Return\u201d), which are endlessly analyzed by devoted Archimboldians in Roberto Bola\u00f1o\u2019s \u201c2666.\u201d I have ached to hear the collected output of the minor soul-music legend Barrett Rude Jr., \u201cone of the most elusive and singular figures in pop-music history,\u201d according to the critic Dylan Ebdus (as imagined by Jonathan Lethem in \u201cFortress of Solitude\u201d). And I have labored through a significant chunk of David Foster Wallace\u2019s epically detailed, 78-entry James O. Incandenza filmography in the footnotes of \u201cInfinite Jest.\u201d Two years after reading Dana Spiotta\u2019s \u201cStone Arabia,\u201d I\u2019m still annoyed that I will never get to discover the music of the rock savant Nik Worth, who (in the novel) once fronted an almost-popular power-pop band called the Fakes and later created a homemade 20-volume album series called \u201cThe Ontology of Worth,\u201d which would almost certainly be world-famous if only anyone had ever heard it. How thrilling it would be to stumble onto a garage-sale copy of a Fakes single (which in my mind might sound something like the Only Ones\u2019 enduring real-life new wave masterpiece \u201cAnother Girl, Another Planet\u201d) or \u2014 holy grail! \u2014 one of the \u201cOntology of Worth\u201d discs. The world is a worse place for Nik\u2019s sad lack of existence.         \n\nRecently I read another summer novel, David Gilbert\u2019s \u201c& Sons\u201d (out July 23), and again found myself falling into that familiar absurd yearning. The book\u2019s central figure is an aging, Salinger-esque writer, A. N. Dyer, who, as his health declines, grapples with complexities involving family, friendships and his influential life\u2019s work. Gilbert could have dealt with Dyer\u2019s books as a necessary afterthought, tossing off some titles and quickly setting down to the real business of regret and death and endlessly messy human relationships. Instead, Gilbert really got into it. \u201c& Sons \u201d conjures a career\u2019s worth of drool-worthy fictional fiction that\u2019s so convincingly evoked, I almost recall writing a paper on it in freshman English class. Gilbert pens large chunks of Dyer\u2019s signature work, \u201cAmpersand,\u201d and describes other novels like \u201cThe Bend of Light\u201d and \u201cHere Live Angry Dogs and Brutal Men.\u201d Here\u2019s the tantalizing first (and sole extant) paragraph of a Dyer novel called \u201cDream Snap\u201d:        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/magazine/theres-no-genius-more-unknown-than-the-one-who-never-was.html", "date": "2013-07-12", "description": "The strange allure of the nonexistent masterpiece."}
