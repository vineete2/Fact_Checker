{"headline": "Facial Scanning Is Making Gains in Surveillance", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The federal government is making progress on developing a surveillance system that would pair computers with video cameras to scan crowds and automatically identify people by their faces, according to  \n and interviews with researchers working on the project.         \n\nThe Department of Homeland Security tested a crowd-scanning project called the Biometric Optical Surveillance System \u2014 or BOSS \u2014 last fall after two years of government-financed development. Although the system is not ready for use, researchers say they are making significant advances. That alarms privacy advocates, who say that now is the time for the government to establish oversight rules and limits on how it will someday be used.         \n\nThere have been stabs for over a decade at building a system that would help match faces in a crowd with names on a watch list \u2014 whether in searching for terrorism suspects at high-profile events like a presidential inaugural parade, looking for criminal fugitives in places like Times Square or identifying card cheats in crowded casinos.         \n\nThe automated matching of close-up photographs has improved greatly in recent years, and companies like Facebook have experimented with it using still pictures.         \n\nBut even with advances in computer power, the technical hurdles involving crowd scans from a distance have proved to be far more challenging. Despite occasional much-hyped tests, including one as far back as the 2001 Super Bowl, technical specialists say crowd scanning is still too slow and unreliable.         \n\nThe release of the  \n about the government\u2019s efforts to overcome those challenges comes amid a surge of interest in surveillance matters inspired by the leaks by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor. Interest in video surveillance was also fueled by  \n, where suspects were identified by officials looking through camera footage.         \n\nIn a sign of how the use of such technologies can be developed for one use but then expanded to another, the BOSS research began as an effort to help the military detect potential suicide bombers and other terrorists overseas at \u201coutdoor polling places in Afghanistan and Iraq,\u201d among other sites, the documents show. But in 2010, the effort was transferred to the Department of Homeland Security to be developed for use instead by the police in the United States.         \n\nAfter a recent test of the system, the department recommended against deploying it until more improvements could be made. A department official said the contractor was \u201ccontinuing to develop BOSS,\u201d although there is no sign of when it may be done. But researchers on the project say they made progress, and independent specialists say it is virtually inevitable that someone will make the broader concept work as camera and computer power continue to improve.         \n\n\u201cI would say we\u2019re at least five years off, but it all depends on what kind of goals they have in mind\u201d for such a system, said  \n, a specialist in computer vision and biometrics engineering at Michigan State University who was not involved in the BOSS project.         \n\nThe effort to build the BOSS system involved a two-year, $5.2 million federal contract given to Electronic Warfare Associates, a Washington-area military contractor with a branch office in Kentucky. The company has been working with the  \n of  \n, a University of Louisville computer vision specialist, and the contract was steered to the firm by an  \n in a 2010 appropriations bill by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader.         \n\nSignificant progress is already being made in automated face recognition using photographs taken under ideal conditions, like passport pictures and mug shots. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is spending $1 billion to roll out a  \n system that will provide a national mug shot database to help local police departments verify identities.         \n\nBut surveillance of crowds from a distance \u2014 in which lighting and shadows vary, and faces tend to be partly obscured or pointed in random directions \u2014 is still not reliable or fast enough. The BOSS research is intended to overcome those challenges by generating far more information for computers to analyze.         \n\nThe system consists of two towers bearing \u201crobotic camera structures\u201d with infrared and distance sensors. They take pictures of the same subject from slightly different angles. A computer then processes the images into a \u201c3-D signature\u201d built from data like the ratios between various points on someone\u2019s face to be compared against data about faces stored in a watch-list database, the documents show.         \n\nThe Homeland Security Department hired the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory to test the BOSS system at an arena in Kennewick, Wash. The plan, according to a \u201c \n,\u201d was to use 30 volunteers whose facial data would be mingled in a database among 1,000 mug shots to see whether the system could reliably recognize when any of the volunteers were present.         \n\nThe agency set up six tests to determine the technology\u2019s overall accuracy, determining afterward that \u201cit was not ready for a D.H.S. customer\u201d \u2014 meaning that police departments should not buy it.         \n\nIn interviews, Ed Tivol of Electronic Warfare Associates and Dr. Farag both suggested that as computer processing becomes ever faster the remaining obstacles will fall away.
