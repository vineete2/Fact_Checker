{"headline": "Chilled Cucumber Soup With Avocado Toast", "body": "\n \n         \n\nA chilled cucumber soup, whirled together in the blender to serve as an instant dinner, is one of the quiet rewards of midsummer. Any other time of year, a bowl of pur\u00e9ed cucumber could seem too scant as an entree. But when the temperature rises and our appetites \u2014 and desire to apply heat to food \u2013 diminish, it\u2019s just about the perfect, effortless meal.         \n\nThe trick to making it hearty enough is to not stint on the seasonings, especially when something as mild as cucumber is the main ingredient. Garlic, plenty of herbs, jalape\u00f1o and anchovy add plenty of flavor, while buttermilk contributes a creamy, light texture. I added a final garnish of raw corn kernels for crunch and contrasting sweetness, but toasted pine nuts or diced red onion would work equally well.         \n\nYou could serve this with nothing more than some crusty or toasted bread on the side and be satisfied. I added a topping of soft avocado dressed with a little lemon juice and feta cheese, which fills out the meal nicely. And the muted green colors of avocado toast and cucumber soup look as cooling as they taste.         \n\n \n         \n\nTime: 15 minutes         \n\nYield: 2 to 4 servings         \n\n1 pound cucumbers, peeled, halved lengthwise and seeded         \n\n2 cups buttermilk (or use 1 1/2 cups plain yogurt plus 1/4 cup water)         \n\n1 large garlic clove, peeled and smashed         \n\n2 anchovy fillets (optional)         \n\n2 small whole scallions, trimmed         \n\n1/2 jalape\u00f1o, seeded, deveined and chopped         \n\n1/2 cup packed mixed fresh herbs (like mint, parsley, dill, tarragon, basil and cilantro)         \n\n1/2 teaspoon sherry or white wine vinegar, more to taste         \n\n3/4 teaspoon kosher sea salt, plus more to taste         \n\n4 slices baguette or other bread, toasted         \n\n1 avocado, pitted, peeled and thinly sliced         \n\n1/2 lemon         \n\n2 tablespoons crumbled feta cheese         \n\nExtra-virgin olive oil, for serving         \n\nFreshly ground black pepper         \n\n1 ear of corn, shucked, kernels sliced off         \n\nFresh dill, for serving         \n\n1. In the bowl of a blender or food processor, combine cucumber, buttermilk, garlic, anchovy, scallions, jalape\u00f1o, fresh herbs, sherry vinegar and salt. Blend until smooth and adjust seasoning as needed.         \n\n2. Smash avocado slices on the toasted bread. Sprinkle with crumbled feta, squeeze the juice of the lemon half over the top and finish each with a drizzle of olive oil and some pepper. Transfer to a plate and set aside.         \n\n3. Distribute soup between 4 bowls and garnish with raw corn kernels and a drizzle of olive oil. Serve avocado toast on the side.
