{"headline": "Our Feel-Good War on Breast Cancer", "body": "\nI used to believe that a mammogram saved my life. I even wrote that in the pages of this magazine. It was 1996, and I had just turned 35 when my doctor sent me for an initial screening \u2014 a relatively common practice at the time \u2014 that would serve as a base line when I began annual mammograms at 40. I had no family history of breast cancer, no particular risk factors for the disease.         \n\nSo when the radiologist found an odd, bicycle-spoke-like pattern on the film \u2014 not even a lump \u2014 and sent me for a biopsy, I wasn\u2019t worried. After all, who got breast cancer at 35?         \n\nIt turns out I did. Recalling the fear, confusion, anger and grief of that time is still painful. My only solace was that the system worked precisely as it should: the mammogram caught my tumor early, and I was treated with a lumpectomy and six weeks of radiation; I was going to survive.         \n\nBy coincidence, just a week after my diagnosis, a panel convened by the National Institutes of Health made headlines when it declined to recommend universal screening for women in their 40s; evidence simply didn\u2019t show it significantly decreased breast-cancer deaths in that age group. What\u2019s more, because of their denser breast tissue, younger women were subject to disproportionate false positives \u2014 leading to unnecessary biopsies and worry \u2014 as well as false negatives, in which cancer was missed entirely.         \n\nThose conclusions hit me like a sucker punch. \u201cI am the person whose life is officially not worth saving,\u201d I wrote angrily. When the American Cancer Society as well as the newer Susan G. Komen foundation rejected the panel\u2019s findings, saying mammography was still the best tool to decrease breast-cancer mortality, friends across the country called to congratulate me as if I\u2019d scored a personal victory. I considered myself a loud-and-proud example of the benefits of early detection.         \n\nSixteen years later, my thinking has changed. As study after study revealed the limits of screening \u2014 and the dangers of overtreatment \u2014 a thought niggled at my consciousness. How much had my mammogram really mattered? Would the outcome have been the same had I bumped into the cancer on my own years later? It\u2019s hard to argue with a good result. After all, I am alive and grateful to be here. But I\u2019ve watched friends whose breast cancers were detected \u201cearly\u201d die anyway. I\u2019ve sweated out what blessedly turned out to be false alarms with many others.         \n\nRecently, a survey of three decades of screening published in November in The New England Journal of Medicine found that mammography\u2019s impact is decidedly mixed: it does reduce, by a small percentage, the number of women who are told they have late-stage cancer, but it is far more likely to result in overdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment, including surgery, weeks of radiation and potentially toxic drugs. And yet, mammography remains an unquestioned pillar of the pink-ribbon awareness movement. Just about everywhere I go \u2014 the supermarket, the dry cleaner, the gym, the gas pump, the movie theater, the airport, the florist, the bank, the mall \u2014 I see posters proclaiming that \u201cearly detection is the best protection\u201d and \u201cmammograms save lives.\u201d But how many lives, exactly, are being \u201csaved,\u201d under what circumstances and at what cost? Raising the public profile of breast cancer, a disease once spoken of only in whispers, was at one time critically important, as was emphasizing the benefits of screening. But there are unintended consequences to ever-greater \u201cawareness\u201d \u2014 and they, too, affect women\u2019s health.         \n\n \n your breast doesn\u2019t kill you; the disease becomes deadly when it metastasizes, spreading to other organs or the bones. Early detection is based on the theory, dating back to the late 19th century, that the disease progresses consistently, beginning with a single rogue cell, growing sequentially and at some invariable point making a lethal leap. Curing it, then, was assumed to be a matter of finding and cutting out a tumor before that metastasis happens.
