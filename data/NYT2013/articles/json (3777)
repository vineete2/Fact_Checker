{"headline": "Cruz, Tea Party Hero, Rankles Senate G.O.P. Colleagues", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Senator  \n\u2019s crusade to dismantle  \n\u2019s  \n has helped cement his status as an emerging hero of the Tea Party and conservative grass roots. But it is stoking resentment and derision from many other Republicans, including his own Senate colleagues, who see his campaign as impractical, self-interested and potentially damaging to the party\u2019s electoral efforts in 2014 and beyond.         \n\nThe episode has drawn unwanted attention to a deepening rift among Republicans who feel torn between warring elements. As the party looks to take the Senate majority next year and recapture the White House in 2016, the split pits an emerging, younger class of social-media-savvy leaders like Mr. Cruz of Texas, who claim the mantle of a resurgent grass roots, against those who believe their colleagues are recklessly pursuing a strategy that builds up individual political brands at the party\u2019s expense.         \n\nSome Republicans are beginning to complain more and more that with the help of outside, Tea Party-inspired groups, Mr. Cruz and others like Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Rand Paul of Kentucky \u2014 both presidential prospects who battled alongside their colleague from Texas in the current health care fight \u2014 are leading conservatives to believe the current fight over cutting money for the health law is winnable when it is not.         \n\n\u201cThis is not a situation where you dig your heels in and Obamacare gets defunded,\u201d said Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, who has one of the most conservative voting records in the Senate. \u201cI think people are willing to hope that\u2019s true. I wish it were true. Trust me, I hope Senator Cruz\u2019s oratory convinces five Democratic senators to vote with us. I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen.\u201d         \n\nMr. Cruz and others who insist that they can prevail in defunding the health care law, Mr. Johnson added, are misleading voters who are looking to them for leadership that the party has lacked lately. \u201cThey just want anybody who offers them a path, whether it\u2019s realistic or not,\u201d he said.         \n\nSenators complained publicly this week that their phone lines had been clogged with calls from voters, many of them misinformed about the true nature of the health care defunding bill now before Congress, as well as the confusing procedural gymnastics taking place on the floor.         \n\n\u201cWe have people calling into our office every day saying, \u2018Please support the House bill,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, referring to the bill that the House passed defunding the Affordable Care Act. \u201cWell, I do,\u201d he added, sounding exasperated. \u201cDo I think this has been a constructive process? Not particularly.\u201d         \n\nMr. Cruz\u2019s 21-hour, all-night assault on the Affordable Care Act \u2014 which ended rather anticlimactically on Wednesday after the Senate voted to take up a budget bill that Democrats intend to alter to their liking \u2014 has focused national attention on the 42-year-old agitator, who is only nine months into his first term in the Senate but appears to have greater ambitions. On Tuesday night as he spoke, his political action committee was hosting a $2,500-per-plate fund-raiser in Washington. A television provided a live feed of his speech.         \n\nMr. Cruz\u2019s efforts have helped re-energize a sizable contingent of conservatives who felt leaderless and demoralized after Republicans lost seats in Congress and the White House last year.         \n\nGroups like FreedomWorks, Heritage Action for America and  \n Express have relished picking fights with Republicans like Mr. Corker, whom they dismiss as turncoats. And this week they mobilized as part of a carefully choreographed and mutually beneficial effort to rally conservatives behind Mr. Cruz\u2019s cause.         \n\nA few days before Mr. Cruz took to the Senate floor on Tuesday, members of his staff began reaching out to some of the country\u2019s leading conservative grass-roots groups.         \n\nThey were cryptic and unspecific, saying only that something big was coming, according to one activist who was contacted, and that they should be prepared to activate their social networks and spread the word. They sprang into action once the senator began talking. They used the Twitter hashtag his staff provided \u2014 #MakeDCListen \u2014 to rally their followers online, and deluged their subscriber lists with millions of e-mails telling people to call their senators and demand they support Mr. Cruz as he pulled his all-nighter.         \n\nSo far, their message of entrenched Washington Republican interests being at odds with the interests of ordinary Americans has proved to be a powerful one.         \n\n\u201cWe should continue the fight, that\u2019s what the people want,\u201d Mr. Paul said shortly after Mr. Cruz left the Senate chamber.
