For centuries, spices and flavorings like these have come from exotic plants growing in remote places like the jungles of Mexico or the terraced hillsides of Madagascar. Some were highly prized along ancient trading routes like the Silk Road.         \n\nNow a powerful form of genetic engineering could revolutionize the production of some of the most sought-after flavors and fragrances. Rather than being extracted from plants, they are being made by genetically modified yeast or other micro-organisms cultured in huge industrial vats.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just like brewing beer, but rather than spit out alcohol, the yeast spits out these products,\u201d said Jay D. Keasling, a co-founder of  \n, a company based here that is a pioneer in the field. However, while yeast makes alcohol naturally, it would not produce the spices without the extensive genetic rejiggering, which is called synthetic biology.         \n\nThe advent of synthetic biology raises thorny economic and regulatory issues, such as whether such yeast-made ingredients can be called natural and whether developing countries dependent on these crops will be hurt.         \n\nSupporters say the technique could benefit food and cosmetic companies, and ultimately consumers, by reducing wild swings in price, availability and quality that come from dependence on agriculture. It may even relieve pressure on some overharvested wild plants like sandalwood, a tree that provides a fragrance.         \n\nThe products, which taste or smell nearly the same as the real thing, are coming quickly and even moving beyond flavors and fragrances to include other commodities, like rubber and drugs.         \n\nIn April, the pharmaceutical company Sanofi began commercial production of an essential malaria drug using baker\u2019s yeast genetically modified by Amyris. The drug\u2019s ingredient is usually extracted from a shrub that grows wild or is cultivated in China, Vietnam and various African countries. Amyris is also making a moisturizer for cosmetics that is typically extracted from either olives or shark livers.         \n\n \n, a Swiss company, is about to start marketing yeast-made vanillin, the main component of vanilla. It is also working on saffron, now obtained mainly from crocuses grown in Iran.         \n\nTwo other companies, Isobionics and Allylix, are separately producing valencene, a flavoring usually extracted from oranges, and nootkatone, a grapefruit flavor that also has potential as an insect repellent.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really environmentally friendly. The whole process is sustainable,\u201d said Toine Janssen, chief executive of  \n, based in the Netherlands.         \n\nBut critics say the technology threatens the livelihoods and exports of developing countries. \u201cThey are going after pockets of tropical farmers around the world,\u201d said Jim Thomas, a researcher at the  \n, a Canadian technology watchdog.         \n\nRick Brownell, an executive at the Virginia Dare Extract Company, a leading supplier of natural vanilla based in Brooklyn, said 80,000 farmers in Madagascar, one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, grow vanilla beans.         \n\n\u201cI really count on that to make a living,\u201d said Bersonina, 63, a farmer in Madagascar. Bersonina, who uses only one name, said in a telephone interview arranged by the company that the $200 he made last year producing about 50 kilograms, or 110 pounds, of vanilla barely supported his family of four. He said he was not familiar with the yeast-made vanilla substitute but imagined that an industrial process \u201ccould make thousands and thousands of tons,\u201d posing a threat to farmers like himself.         \n\nChemically synthesized substitutes for vanillin and other extracts already exist and fermentation has long been used to make some vitamins and citric acid. But proponents of synthetic biology say that the more extensively modified yeast can make things that cannot be synthesized chemically and could not previously be made by fermentation. They also say the resulting products might be more natural than chemical substitutes.         \n\n\u201cThe need for natural is the key driver,\u201d said Ahmet Baydar, director of research and development at International Flavors and Fragrances, the big flavorings company that will market Evolva\u2019s vanillin.         \n\nEvolva\u2019s vanillin cannot be called natural vanilla, because the vanilla bean product contains scores of components besides vanillin. But it conceivably could be called a natural ingredient since it is made in a living organism, said John B. Hallagan, general counsel of the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association.         \n\n \n is hoping that the vanillin will be attractive to food companies that want to label their products all-natural but do not want to pay the higher price for natural vanilla.
