{"headline": "Cornell Scientist\u2019s Quest: Perfect Broccoli", "body": "\nGENEVA, N.Y. \u2014 There it sits, a deep-green beauty at the farmers\u2019 market: that sweet, crisp nutritional dynamo we know as fresh local broccoli.         \n\nAnd then there\u2019s this: a bitter, rubbery mass that\u2019s starting to turn yellow around the tips, all bumped and bruised from its long trip from the field to the supermarket.         \n\n \n, a plant scientist at  \n, examined the store-bought specimen like a diagnostician, unflinchingly but with a certain compassion.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s soft, almost limp,\u201d he said, prodding one of the heads. \u201cThat sharp smell is from the sulfur compounds. Scale of 10, with 10 being broccoli picked the same day you eat it? I\u2019d give this a 2, maybe a 3.\u201d         \n\nFor all the wonders of fresh broccoli, in most parts of the country it is available from local growers only during the cooler weeks at either end of the growing season, nowhere near long enough to become a fixture in grocery stores or kitchens.         \n\nBroccoli hates too much heat, which is why 90 percent of it sold in the United States comes from temperate California, which is often bathed by fog. The heads are fine if you live there, but for the rest of us they require a long truck ride (four or five days to the East Coast) and then some waiting time in a warehouse, tarnishing the appeal of a vegetable that health experts can\u2019t praise enough.         \n\nBut Mr. Bjorkman and a team of fellow researchers are out to change all that. They\u2019ve created a new version of the plant that can thrive in hot, steamy summers like those in New York, South Carolina or Iowa, and that is easy and inexpensive enough to grow in large volumes.         \n\nAnd they didn\u2019t stop there: This crucifer is also crisp, subtly sweet and utterly tender when eaten fresh-picked, which could lift the pedestrian broccoli into the ranks of the vegetable elite. Think Asian-style salads of shaved stems, Mr. Bjorkman suggests, or an ultra-crisp tempura with broccoli that doesn\u2019t need parboiling.         \n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve had really fresh broccoli, you know it\u2019s an entirely different thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if the health-policy goal is to vastly increase the consumption of broccoli, then we need a ready supply, at an attractive price.\u201d         \n\nThe new broccoli is part of a mad dash by Cornell scientists to remake much of the produce aisle. The goal is to help shift American attitudes toward fruits and vegetables by increasing their allure and usefulness in cooking, while maintaining or even increasing their nutritional loads. In recent months, the Cornell lab has turned out a full-flavored habanero pepper without the burning heat, snap peas without the pesky strings, and luscious apples that won\u2019t brown when sliced \u2014 a huge boon to school cafeteria matrons plagued by piles of fruit that students won\u2019t eat unless it is cut up.         \n\nThe  \n, based at the university\u2019s Agricultural Experiment Station here in this small Finger Lakes city, also aims to maximize the new broccoli\u2019s concentration of glucoraphanin, a compound that has been found to aid in preventing  \n.         \n\nIn this crusade, Mr. Bjorkman, 50, is a hybrid of Mr. Wizard and the Mr. Smith who went to Washington. While developing the new plants, he has lobbied lawmakers on Capitol Hill to include money for vegetable research in the new  \n. He has reached out to farmers, grocers and economists to ensure the new broccoli finds a mass market, first in the East, then in other parts of the country.         \n\nTwo years of successful trials involving the largest seed companies have made the hot-weather broccoli plants ready for farming, though it may be several more years before East Coast grocers start selling the local florets.         \n\nBut while Mr. Bjorkman is a passionate agrarian and vegetarian, his Perfect Broccoli may challenge a purist view of food. Critics are generally fine with his science, which involves fairly traditional forms of biotechnology, like using petri dishes to mate broccoli with radishes and other plants that would never hook up on their own, and selecting genes through this breeding that can minimize production costs and maximize consumer appeal.         \n\nRather, they cringe at his collaboration with large seed companies like  \n, whose biotechnology lineup includes squash and sweet corn developed with the far more advanced technology of genetic modification. Neither Monsanto nor Mr. Bjorkman says they have plans to pursue that method in developing better broccoli.         \n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s another example of Monsanto\u2019s  \n,\u201d said Marion Nestle, a New York University nutrition professor and the author of  \n \u201cAnd that is a huge and legitimate question: Should one corporation have that level of control over things people depend on?\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/10/dining/a-scientist-helps-to-reinvent-broccoli.html", "date": "2013-07-09", "description": "A new seed promises to flower in more climates, improving freshness and taste for many."}
