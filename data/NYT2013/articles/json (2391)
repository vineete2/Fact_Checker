{"headline": "U.S. Weighs Wide Overhaul of Wiretap Laws", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration, resolving years of internal debate, is on the verge of backing a  \n plan for a sweeping overhaul of surveillance laws that would make it easier to wiretap people who communicate using the Internet rather than by traditional phone services, according to officials familiar with the deliberations.         \n\nThe F.B.I. director,  \n, has argued that the bureau\u2019s ability to carry out court-approved eavesdropping on suspects is \u201cgoing dark\u201d as communications technology evolves, and  \n for a legal mandate requiring companies like Facebook and Google to build into their instant-messaging and other such systems a capacity to comply with wiretap orders. That proposal, however, bogged down amid concerns by other agencies, like the Commerce Department, about quashing Silicon Valley innovation.         \n\nWhile the F.B.I.\u2019s original proposal would have required Internet communications services to each build in a wiretapping capacity, the revised one, which must now be reviewed by the White House, focuses on fining companies that do not comply with wiretap orders. The difference, officials say, means that start-ups with a small number of users would have fewer worries about wiretapping issues unless the companies became popular enough to come to the Justice Department\u2019s attention.         \n\nStill, the plan is likely to set off a debate over the future of the Internet if the White House submits it to Congress, according to lawyers for technology companies and advocates of Internet privacy and freedom.         \n\n\u201cI think the F.B.I.\u2019s proposal would render Internet communications less secure and more vulnerable to hackers and identity thieves,\u201d said Gregory T. Nojeim of the Center for Democracy and Technology. \u201cIt would also mean that innovators who want to avoid new and expensive mandates will take their innovations abroad and develop them there, where there aren\u2019t the same mandates.\u201d         \n\nAndrew Weissmann, the general counsel of the F.B.I., said in a statement that the proposal was aimed only at preserving law enforcement officials\u2019 longstanding ability to investigate suspected criminals, spies and terrorists subject to a court\u2019s permission.         \n\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t create any new legal surveillance authority,\u201d he said. \u201cThis always requires a court order. None of the \u2018going dark\u2019 solutions would do anything except update the law given means of modern communications.\u201d         \n\nA central element of the F.B.I.\u2019s 2010 proposal was to expand the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act \u2014 a 1994 law that already requires phone and network carriers to build interception capabilities into their systems \u2014 so that it would also cover Internet-based services that allow people to converse. But the bureau has now largely moved away from that one-size-fits-all mandate.         \n\nInstead, the new proposal focuses on strengthening wiretap orders issued by judges. Currently, such orders instruct recipients to provide technical assistance to law enforcement agencies, leaving wiggle room for companies to say they tried but could not make the technology work. Under the new proposal, providers could be ordered to comply, and judges could impose fines if they did not. The shift in thinking toward the judicial fines was first reported by  \n, and additional details were described to The New York Times by several officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity.         \n\nUnder the proposal, officials said, for a company to be eligible for the strictest deadlines and fines \u2014 starting at $25,000 a day \u2014 it must first have been put on notice that it needed surveillance capabilities, triggering a 30-day period to consult with the government on any technical problems.         \n\nSuch notice could be the receipt of its first wiretap order or a warning from the attorney general that it might receive a surveillance request in the future, officials said, arguing that most small start-ups would never receive either.         \n\nMichael Sussmann, a former Justice Department lawyer who advises communications providers, said that aspect of the plan appeared to be modeled on a British law, the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act of 2000.         \n\nForeign-based communications services that do business in the United States would be subject to the same procedures, and would be required to have a point of contact on domestic soil who could be served with a wiretap order, officials said.         \n\nAlbert Gidari Jr., who represents technology companies on law enforcement matters, criticized that proposed procedure. He argued that if the United States started imposing fines on foreign Internet firms, it would encourage other countries, some of which may be looking for political dissidents, to penalize American companies if they refused to turn over users\u2019 information.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll look a lot more like China than America after this,\u201d Mr. Gidari said.         \n\nThe expanded fines would also apply to phone and network carriers, like Verizon and AT&T, which are separately subject to the 1994 wiretapping capacity law. The FBI has  \n.         \n\nThe 1994 law would be expanded to cover peer-to-peer voice-over-Internet protocol, or VoIP \u2014 calls between computers that do not connect to the regular phone network. Such services typically do not route data packets through any central hub, making them difficult to intercept.         \n\nThe F.B.I. has abandoned a component of its original proposal that would have required companies that facilitate the encryption of users\u2019 messages to always have a key to unscramble them if presented with a court order. Critics had charged that such a law would create back doors for hackers. The current proposal would allow services that fully encrypt messages between users to keep operating, officials said.         \n\nIn November 2010, Mr. Mueller  \n as it then existed, urging them not to lobby against it, but the firms have adopted a cautious stance. In February 2011, the F.B.I.\u2019s top lawyer at the time testified about the \u201cgoing dark\u201d problem at  \n, emphasizing that there was no administration proposal yet. Still, several top lawmakers at the hearing expressed skepticism, raising fears about innovation and security.
