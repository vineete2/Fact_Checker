{"headline": "The Artist Who Talks With the Fishes", "body": "\nFour years ago, the Australian-born artist Natalie Jeremijenko stood at the edge of Pier 35 in Downtown Manhattan, trying to start a conversation with some striped bass. Just north of the Manhattan Bridge, she and several collaborators dropped 16 tall buoys into the East River. The buoys were fitted with submersible sensors that monitored water quality and with LEDs that flashed when fish swam by, charting the Piscean passage. \u201cI fell into the river four times installing it,\u201d Jeremijenko recalls. \u201cYou have no idea, just standing on land, how ferocious those currents are!\u201d         \n\nThe installation, \u201cAmphibious Architecture,\u201d devised with the architect David Benjamin, stayed in the river for several months \u2014 a miniature skyline bobbing and blinking in the reflected glare of the real thing. With the piece, Jeremijenko was interested, she said, in \u201chighlighting what\u2019s under this pretty reflective surface that enhances real estate value but is actually a diverse, teeming habitat.\u201d Viewers on land alerted to the presence of fish could send them text messages care of an SMS number. The fish then \u201cresponded\u201d with texts of their own, chatting about themselves and their surroundings: \u201cHey there! There are 11 of us, and it\u2019s pretty nice down here. I mean, Dissolved oxygen is higher than last week. . . .\u201d         \n\nAt New York University, where she is a professor of visual art, Jeremijenko had developed seaweed bars containing a PCB-chelating agent that observers were encouraged to hurl into the river \u2014 food meant to help rid the fish, and by extension, the water, of toxins. This snack was formulated to taste \u201cdelicious\u201d to fish and humans alike: if you were feeling peckish, you could have what they were having. \u201cIt\u2019s a very visceral way of demonstrating that we share the same natural resources, we eat the same stuff,\u201d she once explained. \u201cThey\u2019re not inhabiting a different world.\u201d         \n\nMuch of Jeremijenko\u2019s work reimagines environmentalism as a kind of open-ended game. She likes to frame ecological arguments not in the common conservationist language of interdiction \u2014 consume less, reduce your food miles, lose those incandescent bulbs \u2014 but rather as overtures to more engaged and imaginative participation. \u201cA lot of my work concerns a crisis of agency \u2014 what can we do?\u201d she says. Her art, which has appeared at the Museum of Modern Art, two Whitney Biennials, the Guggenheim and her New York gallery, Postmasters, can take the shape of fanciful provocations, prototypes for functioning systems or, as often as not, both. The idea, she says, is to design interfaces or write scripts that will \u201cfacilitate interactions between humans and nonhumans.\u201d         \n\nOn a recent morning, Jeremijenko was at her Greenwich Village apartment, busily preparing a new installation for the East River. Out in the hallway, affixed to her front door, was an oversize postcard depicting Jesus Christ astride a smiling brontosaurus. \u201cMy son decided that should be there,\u201d Jeremijenko said, letting me in. Papers and books covered nearly every horizontal surface; clothing and exercise equipment lay scattered across the floor. A Yorkshire terrier named Wuppy hopped around, yipping as he alternately licked my fingers and bit my ankles. There was no kitchen, just a small refrigerator and a wheeled counter in the living room\u2019s far corner. \u201cThis was originally a two-bedroom apartment,\u201d Jeremijenko said. \u201cI put up a bookshelf to divide it, and my oldest daughter lives on the other side. She got the part with the kitchen.\u201d (In addition to her elder daughter, who is 26, Jeremijenko has two adolescent children from her marriage to the sociologist Dalton Conley: a girl, 15, and a boy, 13, who spend time here and with their father.) In the bathroom was a dish rack laden with china, and silverware was perched above the toilet; a spoon encrusted with dry oatmeal sat in the sink near some toothbrushes and a bottle of dish soap. \u201cI used to have a lovely Chelsea loft \u2014 then I got divorced,\u201d Jeremijenko said wryly.
