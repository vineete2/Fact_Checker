{"headline": "Frank, Once Kidd\u2019s Right-Hand Man, Is Demoted", "body": "\nLess than two hours before  \n tipped off against the  \n on Tuesday, Coach  \n announced a change to his staff. Lawrence Frank, Kidd\u2019s top lieutenant and the Nets\u2019 only assistant with head-coaching experience, was being reassigned away from game and practice duties.         \n\nMost staff changes in the N.B.A. \u2014 unless they involve the head coach \u2014 hardly elicit more than a shrug from fans and the news media, but 17 games into this season, Frank\u2019s effective demotion represented a seismic shake-up for the struggling Nets. It raised more questions about Kidd\u2019s untested grip on the franchise in his first season, and it abruptly voided the perception that Kidd wanted Frank to show him the ropes, as he had said often in courting Frank to team with him in Brooklyn.         \n\nInstead, the mentored has apparently spurned the mentor, casting him aside while the Nets and Kidd try to figure out what kind of team they can be together. When asked if he could have handled coaching without Frank\u2019s supervision at the outset, Kidd responded, somewhat defiantly, \u201cI\u2019ve been doing it from Day 1.\u201d         \n\nHe added, \u201cUnderstanding what it means to be a coach and having guys ready \u2014 that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing since summer league.\u201d         \n\nThat has yet to translate into on-court success, as the Nets fell to 5-13 with a 111-87  \n to the Nuggets at Barclays Center. The Nuggets (11-6) have won seven straight under Coach Brian Shaw, who had been one of the top candidates for General Manager Billy King in his off-season search for a coach.         \n\nInstead, King went with Kidd, days after Kidd announced his retirement from a 19-year N.B.A. career. Less than a month after that, Kidd brought in Frank, who had been fired after two seasons as head coach of the Detroit Pistons.         \n\nOn the surface, it appeared to be a snug fit. Kidd played under Frank in New Jersey, starting when Frank was an assistant from 2001 to 2004. Frank became the head coach in 2004, and Kidd remained with the Nets until 2008. In parts of seven seasons leading the Nets, Frank won 225 games, more than any coach in franchise history.         \n\nTheir relationship was supposedly tight, and Kidd did not hide the fact that he wanted to bring Frank onto his staff. The Nets signed him for six years at more than $1 million per year. It was a homecoming story line and a marriage that seemed immeasurably beneficial to Kidd.         \n\nBut within time, there were also rumblings of discontent and signs of friction, such as Frank\u2019s especially vocal role in practices early on, which seemed to diminish over time, and Kidd\u2019s decision not to name Frank the interim coach while serving a two-game suspension at the start of the season.         \n\nKidd would not elaborate on why the change was made, citing only different philosophies. He said Frank would be assigned to file daily reports, but would not attend games or practices.         \n\n\u201cThis is my decision and what I had to do,\u201d Kidd said. \u201cIt\u2019s about basketball. That\u2019s it.\u201d         \n\nFrank left the team in early October for undisclosed personal reasons. He left the Pistons for six games in March because his wife was seriously ill, and conceivably that could have factored into Tuesday\u2019s decision.         \n\nBut the timing of the Nets\u2019 move, after a rocky month, left them appearing only more unsettled. On Monday, they announced that Paul Pierce, one of their prized off-season acquisitions, could miss a month with a hand injury. Deron Williams, the point guard, remains sidelined with an ankle injury.         \n\nKidd now has the responsibility of shepherding a staff with no head-coaching experience, and already his sideline transgressions have put him in hot water. Last week, he was fined $50,000 by the league for spilling a cup of soda on the court to stall at the end of a game when his team had no timeouts.         \n\nKidd said there would be no other changes to the staff, meaning no one would be hired to replace Frank on the bench. Frank\u2019s specialty was coaching the defense \u2014 with John Welch addressing the offense \u2014 and Kidd said the staff now would just \u201cbe coaches.\u201d         \n\nIn other words, for better or worse, they are on their own.         \n\n\u201cWe move forward,\u201d Kidd said. \u201cYou learn.\u201d         \n\nOn Tuesday, the Nets trailed by only 4 points, 60-56, with 8 minutes 35 seconds left in the third. But they could not stay with the athletically superior Nuggets, who outrebounded the Nets by 56-37, pushed the tempo and shot 50.6 percent from the floor. Before the quarter was over, the Nets trailed by 20 and the fans began to boo.         \n\nIt was a foreboding sign that on the night the Nets demoted their defensive-minded assistant, they nearly surrendered a season high in points.         \n\nForward Kevin Garnett said the shake-up was no excuse for the team\u2019s dismal performance.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of moving parts around here,\u201d Garnett said. \u201cWe\u2019re just all trying to adjust to it.\u201d         \n\nKidd spent most of the fourth quarter seated on the bench, next to Welch, but no longer next to Frank.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to find some answers,\u201d Kidd said, \u201cwhy we\u2019re kind of going our separate ways instead of staying as a team.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/04/sports/basketball/lawrence-frank-no-longer-jason-kidds-top-assistant-with-brooklyn-nets.html", "date": "2013-12-03", "description": "Before the Nets\u2019 loss to the Nuggets, Coach Jason Kidd announced that Lawrence Frank had been reassigned from his position on the bench as Kidd\u2019s top assistant."}
