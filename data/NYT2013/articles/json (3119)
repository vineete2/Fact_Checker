{"headline": "Free Apps for Nearly Every Health Problem, but What About Privacy?", "body": "\nNeed to lose weight, quit smoking, improve your sex life or get a better night\u2019s sleep? There\u2019s an app for that \u2014 all of it \u2014 and more. Thousands of mobile apps are available to improve your health and fitness.         \n\nBut beware.         \n\nHealth apps can provide information and motivation to help you manage your well-being, and they\u2019re easy to use and often free. But they may not have protecting your privacy as a priority.         \n\nHealth apps collect all sorts of personal information, like your name, e-mail address, age, height and weight. Others get even more detailed, depending on the focus of the app; fertility apps, for instance, allow you to enter details of your menstrual cycle, and exercise apps allow you to post the route of your daily jog.         \n\nYet, an analysis of 43 popular wellness apps by the nonprofit Privacy Rights Clearinghouse found that many apps connect to advertising and data analysis sites without the user\u2019s knowledge. And, they often transmit unencrypted information over insecure network connections \u2014 possibly including your medical and pharmaceutical search terms, like those for sexually transmitted diseases or antipsychotic drugs. That\u2019s the computer equivalent of sending a postcard, rather than a letter \u2014 it\u2019s easy for others on a network to read what\u2019s being transmitted, said Craig Michael Lie Njie, a consultant who did the technical analysis for the report.         \n\nFor the analysis, financed by the California Consumer Protection Foundation, the clearinghouse used apps available on the iTunes App Store, for iOS devices, and Google Play for Android phones and tablets. (The report didn\u2019t identify the apps, saying its goal is to educate consumers and app developers.)         \n\nThe report concluded that health apps posed \u201cconsiderable\u201d privacy risks for consumers, and users shouldn\u2019t assume any of their data on a mobile app was private. Only 13 percent of free apps, and 10 percent of paid apps, encrypted all data connections between the app and the developer\u2019s Web site. Many apps don\u2019t have privacy policies, and those that do don\u2019t always adequately describe the potential risks. More than a quarter of the free apps, and 40 percent of the paid apps, had no privacy policy at all.         \n\nRobin Thurston, chief executive of MapMyFitness, which offers a group of exercise sites and apps including the popular MapMyRun, said his company had developed a detailed privacy policy explaining how user information was used. It also includes a link for users who want to opt out of certain kind of ads. \u201cOur apps are not passing any individual health information to any third-party services,\u201d he said. \u201cI can tell you we are not doing that with people\u2019s information.\u201d         \n\nHe advised consumers to consider the credibility of the health apps they choose. Better-known brands and developers with a track record \u2014 in which he includes MapMyFitness \u2014 have more resources to spend on comprehensive data security, whereas smaller or offshore operations may be less reliable. With very small app developers, \u201cYou could be sending your data into someone\u2019s home server to be stored,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure consumers are aware of that.\u201d         \n\nMike Lee, chief executive of MyFitnessPal, which offers a free calorie counter app, said in an e-mailed statement: \u201cProtecting our customers\u2019 personal information is and always has been a top priority. For example, we work very hard to ensure that any data provided to us is transmitted and stored in a secure manner.\u201d He said the company did not sell customers\u2019 data or use it in any way without explicit permission.         \n\nMany apps encourage users to share information through social media sites like Facebook, to seek support for their weight loss or fitness goal. But you should be cautious about revealing details of your medical conditions, since once information is public you have little control over it.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not telling people not to use them,\u201d Beth Givens, director of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, said of health apps. \u201cBut you should know what you\u2019re getting into.\u201d         \n\nHere are some questions to consider.         \n\n\u25a0  \n         \n\nMedical information that\u2019s shared directly between you and your doctor or your hospital is covered by the privacy provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or Hipaa. But there\u2019s little regulatory protection for health information shared over consumer apps, unless it\u2019s a device prescribed or provided by your physician. In most cases, \u201cYou\u2019re on your own with these commercially available apps,\u201d said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, a senior staff technologist who works on health privacy issues at the Center for Democracy and Technology.         \n\n \n         \n\nYou should assume any information you impart using an app will be shared, Ms. Givens said. But you may get better protection by using paid apps, rather than free ones, because paid apps don\u2019t rely solely on advertising revenue \u2014 and so are less likely to share information with outside firms that gather information to target their ads.         \n\n \n  \n         \n\nTry to read an app\u2019s privacy policy before using it. The policy should describe the app\u2019s information-sharing practices, and may give instructions for opting out of some of them. If it\u2019s not available within the app, it may be posted on the developer\u2019s Web site. You can even try to contact the developer with questions.         \n\nPrivacy policies, however, are mainly aimed at protecting app developers from lawsuits, rather than protecting the privacy of your information, said Mr. Lie Njie. He advises sharing only data that you wouldn\u2019t mind becoming public.
