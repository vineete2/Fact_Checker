{"headline": "Rich Risotto, Full-Bodied Wine", "body": "\nA dish this rich requires a similarly broad, full-bodied wine, like a sumptuous chardonnay, something from the C\u00f4te de Beaune, Pouilly-Fuiss\u00e9, California or Oregon, even Australia, rather than a whipsaw Chablis or other lean example. Within that group,\u00a0the best choices would be textured and mineral rather than overtly oaky or flamboyantly fruity.         \n\nBeyond chardonnay, other options to consider include a good white Bordeaux from Pessac-L\u00e9ognan, pinot blanc, pinot gris from Alsace or white Rh\u00f4nes like Condrieu or Hermitage blanc.\u00a0        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/13/dining/rich-risotto-full-bodied-wine.html", "date": "2013-11-12", "description": "A sumptuous chardonnay, rather than a whipsaw Chablis or other lean example."}
