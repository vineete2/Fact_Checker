Pushes New Abortion Limits to Appease Vocal Base", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 After Republicans lost the presidential election and seats in both the House and the Senate last year, many in the party offered a stern admonishment: If we want to broaden our appeal, steer clear of divisive social and cultural issues.         \n\nYet after the high-profile murder trial of an abortion doctor in Philadelphia this spring, many Republicans in Washington and in state capitals across the country seem eager to reopen the emotional fight over a woman\u2019s right to end a pregnancy. Their efforts will move to the forefront on Tuesday when House Republicans plan to bring to the floor a measure that would prohibit the procedure after 22 weeks of pregnancy \u2014 the most restrictive abortion bill to come to a vote in either chamber in a decade.         \n\nThe bill stands no chance of becoming law, with Democrats in control of the Senate and the White House. Republican leaders acknowledge that its purpose is to satisfy vocal elements of their base who have renewed a push for greater restrictions on reproductive rights, even if those issues harmed the party\u2019s reputation with women in 2012.         \n\nBut beyond Washington, advocates on both sides of the issue say the chance to limit abortion in the near future is very real. Republican-dominated state legislatures in South Carolina and Wisconsin are weighing bans similar to the one the House will vote on, which would impose the 22-week limit based on the scientifically disputed theory that fetuses at that stage of development can feel pain.         \n\nThe measures stand a reasonable chance of passing in both states as well as in Texas, where last week Gov. Rick Perry  \n to the Legislature\u2019s agenda. Conservatives  \n for a vote by next week.         \n\nAlready this year,  \n and  \n have passed even more restrictive bans in attempts to directly challenge Supreme Court precedent.         \n\nMuch of the movement in recent weeks can be linked to the outcry over the case of Dr. Kermit Gosnell, the Philadelphia physician who was  \n for cutting the spines of babies after botched abortions.         \n\nHis case, coming on top of successful efforts to curtail reproductive rights in several states over the last three years, has reinvigorated the anti-abortion movement to a degree not seen in years, advocates on both sides of the issue said.         \n\n\u201cThese laws are flying through,\u201d said Elizabeth Nash, a policy analyst for the  \n, a research group that supports access to abortions. \u201cThe attention has really been at the state level around abortion issues. Now what you also see at the federal level is very disturbing, and it shows that abortion opponents are very emboldened.\u201d         \n\nDouglas Johnson, legislative director for the  \n, called the House bill \u201cthe most significant legislation on abortion\u201d at the federal level since 2003, when Congress passed a ban on a type of late-term procedure that opponents call partial-birth abortion.         \n\nOn the eve of the House vote, the Obama administration released a statement late Monday opposing the bill, saying it \u201cshows contempt for women\u2019s health and rights.\u201d         \n\nAware of the risks inherent in abortion politics, Republican leaders have moved to insulate themselves from Democrats\u2019 criticism that they are opening a new front in the \u201cwar on women.\u201d Representative Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, will manage the debate on the bill when it reaches the House floor, a role that would customarily go to the sponsor, Representative  \n.         \n\nAnd in  \n, House leaders slipped in a provision that would allow for a limited exception in cases of rape or incest, but only if the woman had reported the crime.         \n\nStill, the re-emergence of abortion as a driving issue among the conservative base has left some moderate Republicans baffled.         \n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a stupid idea to bring this up,\u201d said  \n of Pennsylvania. \u201cThe economy is on everybody\u2019s minds. We\u2019re seeing stagnant job numbers. Confidence in the institution, in government, is eroding. And now we\u2019re going to have a debate on rape and abortion.\u201d         \n\nMr. Dent said the party risked opening itself up to another \u201cAkin eruption,\u201d a reference to  \n in a Senate race after saying women\u2019s bodies could block a pregnancy after \u201ca legitimate rape.\u201d         \n\nIndeed, Republicans had an unpleasant reminder last week of how perilous the politics of reproductive rights can be when Mr. Franks defended his bill\u2019s lack of an exception for rape by saying \n This occurred at a meeting of the House Judiciary Committee, which Democrats noted with some satisfaction contained not a single woman on the Republican side.         \n\nBut most of the Republican rank and file and their leaders in Congress are solidly behind the bill, arguing that voters back home are clamoring to see something done after the Gosnell case.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hearing from a lot of people who are appalled,\u201d Ms. Blackburn said, pointing to  \n of the public opposes legal second-trimester abortions. \u201cThey feel like this is an appropriate step in this discussion.\u201d         \n\nUnlike other major policy questions that Democrats and Republicans are fighting over this year, like same-sex marriage and background checks for gun buyers, Democrats do not find themselves with either overwhelming public opinion on their side or a favorable shift in sentiment.         \n\nHouse Republicans reject the notion that they are ignoring the lessons of 2012 by not focusing on a message of \u201cgrowth and opportunity,\u201d as the party\u2019s  \n recommended.
