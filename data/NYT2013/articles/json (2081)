{"headline": "Readers React to Death of a Diver, and an Image of Him", "body": "\nWhen the free diver Nick Mevoli, 32, emerged Sunday from an attempt at diving 72 meters below the ocean surface in the Bahamas, the photographer Lia Hyun-Joo Barrett caught him in a frame.  \n, Mr. Mevoli, accompanied by three safety divers, looks startled, his eyes bulging.         \n\nMoments later, he was splayed on a dock fighting for his life, but despite the efforts of the safety divers and a German doctor who administered CPR and three shots of adrenaline over the course of 90 minutes, Mr. Mevoli died. He reportedly had pulmonary edema, the result of capillaries in his body bursting under the pressure of the ocean water surrounding him and flooding his lungs.         \n\nReaders of  \n questioned the ethics of seeing a man\u2019s last conscious moments in print.         \n\nM, from Connecticut,  \n: \u201cIs it appropriate for The New York Times to use this photo of Mr. Mevoli, who clearly looks disoriented and, as the caption points out, will soon pass away? The use of this picture seems morbid, insensitive to Mr. Mevoli\u2019s family and friends, and a bit sensationalist.\u201d         \n\nAnn, from Providence, R.I.,  \n: \u201cMr. Mevoli was participating in a public competition. The photo, while disturbing, speaks volumes about the dangers of the sport depicted. This is exactly why I read the NYT \u2014 to get such well-reported articles and compelling photos.\u201d         \n\nPaulCometX, from New York,  \n if the use of such a photo might serve as a warning: \u201cLooking at the image gave me pause to reflect on mortality, risk taking and similar matters. Perhaps another free diver will see this photo and reconsider his sport. Sad as this image is, it is a reality check for those of us who forget that actions have consequences.\u201d         \n\nMr. Mevoli\u2019s friends and fellow divers flocked to our comments section to reminisce about him and to paint a broader picture of the man. Some remembered him from his prodigious theater, film and television work in New York. He held several jobs \u2014 including as a prop master on the hit television show \u201cGossip Girl\u201d \u2014 to fund his diving and travel expenses. Others knew him only by reputation as a diver.         \n\nLizBurke wrote in several times to discuss Mr. Mevoli, who was a friend. The two knew each other, she said, from his work with the Rising Sun Performance Group, where he acted, wrote and worked a technician.         \n\n\u201cWhile I am shocked, I do not think this is depressing,\u201d  \n \u201cA life lived without courage and risk is depressing. An office worker too afraid to leave and do what they love is depressing. Being 32 and living the life you chose, competing in a sport you love, surrounded by friends and being loved is not depressing \u2014 it is celebratory.\u201d         \n\nSeveral commenters questioned whether free diving should be considered a sport or a stunt. What separates the two, and what makes a person an athlete versus a mere thrill seeker?         \n\n\u201cThis is obsession, not sport,\u201d James Conner of Montana  \n.         \n\nA reader known as American Overseas  \n, writing: \u201cThis is no different than experiencing the thrill of skydiving without a parachute. Athletes know their bodies have limits against nature, and they respect them in order to live another day.\u201d         \n\nBut to  \n, Mr. Mevoli was no different from any other athlete \u2014 he just had a more formidable opponent than most: \u201cMr. Mevoli loved this sport, was inspired, trained, pushed, excelled, and that unforgiving ocean and human frailty won. He didn\u2019t hurt anyone, didn\u2019t take anyone with him, didn\u2019t create any victims.\u201d         \n\nFor some readers, the divide between sport and stunt came down to the pursuit of records.         \n\nJJ of Bangor, Me.,  \n free divers should stop competing and keeping track of records. \u201cIn other sports like track and field,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthere is no or very little real danger of killing oneself by going to the very limits of physical endurance.\u201d         \n\nAJ Burr of Illinois  \n \u201cIf we continue to define excellence as the achievement of some numerical goal,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthen a story like this is the logical consequence.\u201d         \n\nBut Nuchsler of Cambridge  \n this notion, saying it was human nature to test our bodies\u2019 limits. \u201cWho ever could have imagined that man could run a sub-four-minute mile? That we could fly, whether by hang glider or a 787? That ordinary people could complete 26.2-mile marathons?\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/21/sports/readers-react-to-a-divers-rise-and-swift-death.html", "date": "2013-11-20", "description": "Times readers debated the ethics of a photograph of the free diver Nicholas Mevoli and the merits of extreme sports."}
