{"headline": "More Than a Decade After 9/11, a Bull Market for Barriers and Checkpoints", "body": "\nWhen United Airlines Flight 175 hit the South Tower, the windows in Mark Scherzer\u2019s apartment collapsed inward in a fine spray of glass shards. Then the tower collapsed and a metal beam flew in, true as an arrow. Dust, inches thick, covered his floors, bed and shelves.         \n\nMr. Scherzer, 62, and his partner became vagabonds for months after  \n, relying on the kindness and couches of friends.         \n\nStill Mr. Scherzer, a native son of the Bronx, could not wait to return to his apartment on Cedar Street, a few feet from ground zero. This was home, and he rebuilt it. What he cannot countenance is what he sees when he looks outside his window, which is to say fear\u2019s stockade.         \n\nThe Police Department now refers to his neighborhood as \u201cthe World Trade Center campus,\u201d as if it were an arid exercise in corporate security.         \n\nStep outside and you tumble into rivers of tourists herded this way and that, from fleets of buses, through serried rows of fences and tents to the memorial.         \n\nThere are security towers and dozens of police officers, some possessing impressive armament.         \n\nThe construction will end. But the plan for the remade streets could offer a cyborg vision of this city, with metal barriers, sally ports, checkpoints and three-foot-high barriers.         \n\nUndergo a security check and you can obtain a \u201cTrusted Access\u201d certificate and sidestep the worst of it. You can ride a bike, if you\u2019re prepared to dismount and let dogs sniff you.         \n\nIt\u2019s as if a thief crept in and stole away with our hurly-burly anarchic identity.         \n\n\u201cSecurity cannot be the be-all and end-all of how we organize our lives,\u201d said Mr. Scherzer, who has joined his neighbors in  \n to block the \u201cfortresslike\u201d plans for his neighborhood. \u201cThere is a constant sense of police presence \u2014 everything is observed, every movement regulated.         \n\n\u201cNew York has never been that for me.\u201d         \n\nIn 2003, hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers took to the streets to protest our entry into the Iraq war; the police penned them so closely as to call to mind a corset yanked tight on democracy.         \n\nThe Police Department now runs long rows of cars through the streets, lights blinking. We\u2019re told it scares terrorists. It certainly rattles New Yorkers.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m struck by how insecure the security makes me feel,\u201d says Mary Perillo, another resident of Cedar Street.         \n\nIt\u2019s as if we\u2019re in a crouch and can\u2019t stand up straight. Once our marathon was a joyous conga-like celebration of New York in its hallucinatory glory. Poles in Greenpoint handed out pirogies and Puerto Rican children in Harlem sprinted alongside runners. Not after Boston. It was police officers, metal gates, dogs and more police officers.         \n\nAs my colleague Juliet Macur  \n, it was as if the race had morphed into a \u201c26.2-mile crime scene.\u201d         \n\nOur security obsessions offer a lunatic sideshow down Broadway from ground zero. There stands the \u201cCharging Bull,\u201d that bronze and virile image of Wall Street unchained. It stands behind steel police fences.         \n\nEvery day and night since Occupy Wall Street, two officers guard that bull. Last week, I saw a couple of fellows from my 70th Precinct in Brooklyn; this weekend the officers hailed from a precinct on Staten Island.         \n\nNeighbors say that during  \n, as the city shuddered and fell dark, officers remained at their posts, guarding that bronze bull.         \n\nI don\u2019t mean to sound glib. I watched those towers collapse and that cloud of cement and biomass and God knows what rolled over me. I coughed for months and that was the least of it. Fear crawled in and curled up in a corner of my cranium.         \n\nIn 2001 I walked through Central Park on a chilly December afternoon, winter\u2019s sun and shadow in play. I peered at our skyline and my mind\u2019s eye saw a jetliner descending into grand prewar buildings. It took several minutes to shake that image.         \n\nYet we healed.         \n\nRich Roth worked for the Secret Service and has evaluated the stockade plan for Lower Manhattan for the plaintiffs. He isn\u2019t impressed.         \n\n\u201cYou want to be 100 percent secure? Nothing can do that,\u201d he says. \u201cNothing they\u2019re doing prevents an airliner from coming down. Nothing prevents someone from setting off a bomb outside the  \n.\u201d         \n\nMr. Scherzer nods at this. He knows the terrible is possible. \u201cI don\u2019t think the cops have a bad motive, not for a minute,\u201d he says. \u201cBut to remain New Yorkers, we cannot live with security as our highest value.\u201d         \n\nLive too long in fear\u2019s shadow and all becomes darkness.
