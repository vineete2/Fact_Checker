{"headline": "A Statement Rocks Rome, Then Sends Shockwaves Around the World", "body": "\nVATICAN CITY \u2014 The decision, delivered in Latin and in unemotional tones by  \n to a gathering of cardinals on Monday, came \u201clike a bolt out of the blue,\u201d one of the participants said, and it soon ricocheted around the world.         \n\nDuring what was supposed to be a routine meeting to discuss the canonization of three potential saints, Benedict read a statement that said, in part, that after examining his conscience \u201cbefore God, I have come to the certainty that my strengths, due to an advanced age, are no longer suited to an adequate exercise\u201d of leading the world\u2019s one billion Roman Catholics. He was resigning on Feb. 28, he said, becoming the first pope to do so in six centuries.         \n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s world,\u201d Benedict said in his announcement, \u201csubject to so many rapid changes and shaken by questions of deep relevance for the life of faith, in order to govern the bark of St. Peter and proclaim the gospel, both strength of mind and body are necessary, strength which in the last few months has deteriorated in me to the extent that I have had to recognize my incapacity to adequately fulfill the ministry entrusted to me.\u201d         \n\nWithin minutes, #Pontifexit was trending on Twitter. Later, during an evening thunderstorm, a lightning bolt struck the dome of St. Peter\u2019s, though the meaning, if any, was not immediately clear.         \n\nIn recent months, Benedict, 85, had been showing signs of age. He often seemed tired and even appeared to doze off during Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve, after being taken to the altar of Saint Peter\u2019s on a wheeled platform. But few expected the pope to resign so suddenly, even though he had said in the past that he would consider the option.         \n\n\u201cThe pope took us by surprise,\u201d said the  \n spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, expounding on one of the most dramatic moments in centuries of Vatican history. He appeared at a hastily called news conference on Monday, where he sat alone at a table, with an unopened bottle of mineral water and a dog-eared copy of a Canon Law guide before him.         \n\nFather Lombardi said the pope did not display strong emotions as he made his announcement, but spoke with \u201cgreat dignity, great concentration and great understanding of the significance of the moment.\u201d         \n\nIn a statement, President Obama recalled meeting with Benedict in 2009. \u201cI have appreciated our work together over these last four years,\u201d the president said. \u201cThe church plays a critical role in the United States and the world, and I wish the best to those who will soon gather to choose His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI\u2019s successor.\u201d         \n\nPrime Minister Mario Monti of Italy called Benedict\u2019s decision \u201cimmense and unexpected.\u201d         \n\nMore than a few observers were struck that such a traditionalist as Benedict would make such an unconventional exit. \u201cA departure that is paradoxically modern for a pope who was so conservative,\u201d said Christian Terras, the founder and executive editor of Golias, a religious review near Lyon, France, that has been critical of the Catholic Church.         \n\nSome said that Benedict\u2019s decision to step down was one of the most dramatic acts in the history of the papacy. \u201cThis decision has been the only great reform of Benedict, and at the same time it is a revolutionary step for the Catholic Church,\u201d said Marco Politi, a Vatican expert and author of a book on Benedict\u2019s papacy. While in past centuries, popes had stepped down over political struggles, Mr. Politi said, \u201cthis is a clear decision and a free decision made by the pope that will set an example also for the future, setting a limit for the pontificate.\u201d         \n\nBenedict\u2019s 89-year-old brother, the Rev. Georg Ratzinger, said that the pope\u2019s weakening health had led him to step down. \u201cHis age was taking its toll,\u201d Father Ratzinger told the German news agency DPA on Monday, adding that he had been aware of his brother\u2019s plan for several months.         \n\nThat the resignation was long in the planning was confirmed by Giovanni Maria Vian, the editor of the Vatican newspaper, L\u2019Osservatore Romano, who wrote on Monday that the pope\u2019s decision \u201cwas taken many months ago,\u201d after his trip to Mexico and Cuba in March 2012, \u201cand kept with a reserve that no one could violate.\u201d         \n\nFather Lombardi said that the pope would retire first to his summer residence in Castel Gandolfo, in the hills outside Rome, and later to a monastery in Vatican City.
