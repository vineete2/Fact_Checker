{"headline": "U.S. Softens Deadline for Deal to Keep Troops in Afghanistan ", "body": "\nKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 With about a week left in the year, the Obama administration is backing away from a Dec. 31 deadline for securing a deal to keep American troops in Afghanistan beyond 2014, though it is standing by its warning that a total military withdrawal is still possible if delays continue, American and Afghan officials said.         \n\nThe decision is a tacit acknowledgment of what has become obvious in both Kabul and Washington: Neither a hard sell nor soft persuasion has yet induced President Hamid Karzai to go along with the American-imposed timeline for the agreement.         \n\nIt is also an embarrassing turn after weeks of threats by some senior administration officials, including Susan E. Rice, the national security adviser, that a complete American withdrawal from Afghanistan \u2014 the so-called zero option \u2014 would be considered if Mr. Karzai did not sign the deal by the year\u2019s end.         \n\nInstead of prompting Mr. Karzai to action, however, setting a boundary appears to have only reinforced  \n if he refuses their demands \u2014 a lesson that has been repeated often over the past 12 years.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I would call it bluffing,\u201d said one American official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. \u201cBut it looks like that\u2019s what we were doing, and now it looks like Karzai is calling us out.\u201d         \n\nThe official insisted that planning for a potentially final withdrawal in 2014 was still underway, and that it was still a very real possibility. \u201cBut if we want a deal,\u201d the official continued, \u201cwe\u2019re going to have to wait.\u201d         \n\nThe question now is how long the administration is willing to wait. American officials have been careful in recent interviews not to suggest any new deadlines. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty obvious why,\u201d one administration official said.         \n\nThe officials spoke only in vague terms about timelines that stretched into the new year, and reiterated earlier statements about how the administration\u2019s preferred outcome is to reach a deal that would permit a small American force, along with some European troops, to stay on to train and advise Afghan soldiers and the police.         \n\nMr. Karzai, after initially agreeing to the wording of the security deal, known as a bilateral security agreement, or B.S.A., said he wanted to wait until after the April 2014 presidential elections before signing.         \n\nBut American officials say they need a deal finalized soon, in part to give European allies, who lack the robust logistics capability of the United States military, time to plan for an extended mission in Afghanistan. They also said the longer they waited, the more likely those in the administration \u2014  \n \u2014 who want a complete withdrawal would gain support.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been clear that our preference is to conclude the B.S.A. by the end of the year, and that if we cannot conclude a B.S.A. promptly thereafter, then we will be forced to initiate planning for a post-2014 future in which there would be no U.S. or NATO troop presence in Afghanistan,\u201d said Laura Magnuson, a spokeswoman for the White House. \u201cThat has not changed.\u201d         \n\nWith the deal in limbo, the official focus in Kabul has shifted to talks on a companion agreement that would allow other NATO members, such as Italy and Germany, to keep forces in Afghanistan after the alliance\u2019s combat mission formally ends next year.         \n\nThe NATO-led coalition here announced the start of talks in a statement this past weekend. The statement was carefully worded, Western officials said, to head off any talk from Mr. Karzai of cutting out the Americans and trying to work only with European allies, an idea he has previously floated in meetings with Western officials.         \n\n\u201cThe NATO status of forces agreement will not be concluded or signed until the signature of the bilateral security agreement between the governments of Afghanistan and the United States,\u201d the NATO secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen,  \n.         \n\nBut Mr. Karzai appears to still be holding out for a better deal with the United States, despite the original accord\u2019s endorsement last month by a grand council of Afghans, known as a loya jirga, and economic signs that  \n in the absence of an agreement.         \n\n\u201cI want this security agreement with the U.S.,\u201d a statement from the presidential palace quoted Mr. Karzai as saying in an off-the-record meeting with Afghan journalists on Sunday. \u201cBut Afghans\u2019 homes should be protected from American operations, and Afghanistan should not become the battleground of a continuous war.\u201d         \n\nMr. Karzai reiterated that a formal peace process with the Taliban must begin before he signs, and that the United States commit itself to Afghanistan\u2019s peace and security.         \n\n\u201cThe conditions that we have put forward for the signing of the security agreement are ridding Afghanistan of instability and war,\u201d Mr. Karzai told the journalists.         \n\nHe would sign, he said, \u201cas soon as they are ready to accept our conditions, because we are not in a rush.\u201d         \n\nAmerican officials have expressed frustration with Mr. Karzai\u2019s demands, saying that the Taliban have not yet shown a willingness to negotiate seriously. And they emphasize that the United States has spent the past 12 years and hundreds of billions of dollars trying to stabilize Afghanistan.         \n\nThey have also said the deal approved last month by the loya jirga is no longer open for negotiation.         \n\nBut some American officials say there are ways to meet Mr. Karzai\u2019s demands without reopening talks. Addenda could be added, or letters could be sent to Mr. Karzai from President Obama that address the Afghan president\u2019s concerns.         \n\nFirst, though, American officials would have to start delivering consistent messages to Mr. Karzai, and to one another, said the American official.         \n\n\u201cI think if you want to explain what\u2019s going on, you have to look at why it\u2019s confusing,\u201d the official said. \u201cWe\u2019ve never spoken with one voice. One person says sign now, another tells Karzai that he has time. It\u2019s not been clear what\u2019s going on.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/24/world/asia/us-softens-deadline-for-deal-to-keep-troops-in-afghanistan.html", "date": "2013-12-23", "description": "The Obama administration is backing away from its tough talk about a total withdrawal if the agreement is not finalized by Dec. 31."}
