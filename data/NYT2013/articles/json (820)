{"headline": "Raising Questions of Professional Conduct as Brooklyn\u2019s Prosecutor Pursues Votes", "body": "\nIn search of love and votes,  \n, the Brooklyn district attorney, cannot seem to stop tripping over himself.         \n\nLast week, he went on a television and radio show for the Orthodox Jewish community and denounced Sam Kellner. Bearded and intense, a bubbling fountain of words, Mr. Kellner is one of the rare few in the Hasidic community who spoke publicly about the plague of child sexual abuse. He helped the district attorney build cases against prominent Hasidic leaders, including a man accused of molesting Mr. Kellner\u2019s own 16-year-old son.         \n\nOr at least Mr. Kellner spoke until Brooklyn prosecutors turned around two years ago and charged him with trying to extort his son\u2019s accused abuser, the Satmar cantor Baruch Lebovits.         \n\nThe weakness of the case against Mr. Kellner is difficult to overstate. On Monday in State Supreme Court, Mr. Hynes\u2019s prosecutors pleaded for more time to reinvestigate their rapidly disintegrating case.         \n\nNone of which appeared to have given pause to Mr. Hynes. \u201cI believe there was a substantial effort by Mr. Kellner to gain money by making up stories,\u201d he told the host of the program, Zev Brenner, last week. \u201cI think we have a substantial case.\u201d         \n\nIt appears Mr. Hynes, who often emphasizes the management experience he has accumulated over many decades, has violated the state\u2019s rules of professional conduct, which prohibit prosecutors from offering \u201cany opinion as to the guilt or innocence of a suspect\u201d in a criminal matter.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an expression of his opinion of Kellner\u2019s guilt, and he can\u2019t say that,\u201d said  \n of New York University, one of the nation\u2019s leading legal ethicists. \u201cHynes may have tried to stop short, but he didn\u2019t stop short enough.\u201d         \n\nThe case against Mr. Kellner comes with curious aspect piled upon curious aspect.         \n\nMr. Lebovits\u2019s lawyers pounced upon the indictment of Mr. Kellner. They pointed to it, and to legal technicalities, and persuaded a state appeals court to overturn their client\u2019s conviction.         \n\nThe two lawyers for Mr. Lebovits \u2014 Arthur L. Aidala and Alan M. Dershowitz \u2014 make a formidable and intriguing pair. A respected trial lawyer, Mr. Aidala is a former Brooklyn prosecutor and a former campaign manager for Mr. Hynes. He is the registered agent for the Charles Hynes Association. Mr. Aidala, his family, and his legal firm contributed $5,100 to the district attorney last year.         \n\nMr. Dershowitz, meanwhile, rendered his own service to Mr. Hynes. Earlier this year, Pro Publica, a respected investigative news Web site, published a critical account of Michael F. Vecchione, a close friend of Mr. Hynes and chief of the district attorney\u2019s rackets bureau. The news site\u2019s account detailed \u201ca staggering array of misconduct\u201d by Mr. Vecchione as he led the prosecution of a young black man, Jabbar Collins, in the killing of an Orthodox Jew. After 15 years in prison, a court overturned Mr. Collins\u2019s conviction; he is  \n.         \n\nMr. Dershowitz and the defense lawyer Benjamin Brafman wrote a public letter to Pro Publica, arguing that its account relied on \u201cunproved claims made in an adversarial complaint\u201d and that this was \u201cwrong and defamatory.\u201d         \n\nAs it happens, Mr. Vecchione is the man who made the decision to try Mr. Kellner. As it also happens, Mr. Vecchione\u2019s credibility took a seismic hit last month when he gave a deposition in the lawsuit brought by Mr. Collins.         \n\nMr. Vecchione is a proud and confident fellow. As recently as 2006, he declared in a court affidavit that \u201cI and I alone determined the course of our investigation.\u201d He insisted, \u201cI still have a clear recollection of it.\u201d         \n\nUnder questioning by Mr. Collins\u2019s lawyer last month, Mr. Vecchione suffered rapid memory loss. Asked why his signature appeared to be forged on key documents, and asked about all manner of irregularities, Mr. Vecchione took rhetorical refuge in a forest of iterations of \u201cI don\u2019t recall.\u201d         \n\nHe says these words over 300 times.         \n\nThis is an election year, and you can\u2019t begrudge politicians searching where they must for votes. The Orthodox community votes in great blocs, and they have been good to Mr. Hynes.         \n\nBut as I sat on a bench in State Supreme Court on Monday and spoke to Mr. Kellner, and he spoke of his life since the indictment, you wonder about the choices made by Brooklyn prosecutors. \u201cTo be screamed at in the street, people say, \u2018You\u2019re an informer.\u2019\u00a0\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cTrust me, it ain\u2019t easy.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/30/nyregion/raising-questions-of-professional-conduct-as-brooklyns-prosecutor-pursues-votes.html", "date": "2013-07-29", "description": "Charles J.
