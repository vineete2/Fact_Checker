{"headline": "What Did You Do When Your Child Wouldn\u2019t Go to School?", "body": "\nWe present a new feature \u2014 New Parent, Old Parent \u2014 which we hope will connect the readers of two Times staples, the  \n blog and  \n. We\u2019re inviting boomer parents who have raised children to exchange ideas with Motherlode parents who are in the thick of it.         \n\nWe\u2019d like to create a conversation between the generations about those confounding problems that keep parents awake at night.         \n\n \n         \n\nI\u2019m the Old Parent in this venture, the father of four children, ages 19 to 25, and the anchor of Booming. My partner, the New Parent, KJ Dell\u2019Antonia, has four children, ages 7, 7, 9 and 12, and runs Motherlode.         \n\nSchool is starting and so we thought we\u2019d begin with a question as old as organized education itself: What am I supposed to do if my child won\u2019t go to school?         \n\nI have found it doesn\u2019t matter that you are big and they are little: somehow they have the edge, which is what people mean when they say that being a parent is a humbling experience.         \n\nIn our family, the resistance manifested at several different stages.         \n\nIn high school on senior skip day. ( \n         \n\nIn fifth grade, refusing to get out of bed.  \n         \n\nAnd in prekindergarten, when our daughter wouldn\u2019t get on the bus, because, as she explained to us,  \n         \n\nAs is true for a lot of these humbling moments, to this day I don\u2019t have a clue whether my wife and I did the right thing.         \n\nIn the case of senior skip day we told them we didn\u2019t approve, and if they got in trouble, they were on their own. (They did it anyway and didn\u2019t get in trouble.)         \n\nIn the case of our fifth grader, we went to the school guidance counselor and learned several kids felt the same way, which started a dialogue with the school administration about the teacher.         \n\nAnd for our 4-year-old daughter, who wouldn\u2019t get on the bus, we tried lots of talking, drove her to school for a while, spoke to the bus driver, and then, after several days, when it still was a problem, lifted her into the bus and had the driver close the door. (I know that sounds like child abuse, but it worked.)         \n\nSo ... Motherlode parents, do you have questions about getting a resistant child to school?         \n\nBoomer parents, are there things you did that worked? And what did not work?         \n\nAnd a question for New and Old: How did your parents handle the problem when you were the child?         \n\n \n, and I\u2019ll round up some of the most interesting answers and post them on Motherlode next Friday. Then it will be the New Parent\u2019s turn to choose a topic.
