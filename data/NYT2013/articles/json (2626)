{"headline": "Googling Yourself Takes on a Whole New Meaning", "body": "\nHere\u2019s what you see if you look at my face: a skinny titanium headband stretched across my forehead. It looks like a futuristic pair of sunglasses, minus the lenses. On my right-hand side there\u2019s a computer, a metal frame with a small, clear cube of plastic perched just over my eye. When I tilt my head upward a bit, or run my finger along the side of the frame, the cube lights up. What I see, floating six inches in front of me, is a pinkish, translucent computer screen. It gives me access to a few simple apps:  \n search, text messaging, Twitter, a to-do list, some hourly news headlines from CNN (\u201cSee a Truck Go Airborne, Fly Over Median,\u201d \u201cDolphin Deaths Alarm Biologists\u201d). Beside the screen is a teensy camera built into the frame of the glasses, ready to record anything I\u2019m looking at.         \n\nGoogle Glass is the company\u2019s attempt to mainstream what the tech industry calls wearable computing, to take the computer off your desk or out of your pocket and keep it in your field of view. In a world where we\u2019re already peering at screens all day long, pecked at by alerts, the prospect of an eyeball computer can provoke a shudder. But over several weeks of using the device myself, I began to experience some of the intriguing \u2014 and occasionally delightful \u2014 aspects of this new machine. I got used to glancing up to start texting and e-mailing by addressing its surprisingly accurate voice-transcription capabilities. (I admit I once texted my wife while riding my bicycle.) I set up calendar reminders that dinged in my ear. I used an app that guided me back to my car in a parking lot. I sent pictures of magazine articles to Evernote, so I would have reminders of what I\u2019d read. I had tweets from friends float across my gaze.         \n\nDespite my quick adoption, however, only rarely did I accomplish something with Glass that I couldn\u2019t already do with, say, my mobile phone. When I first heard about the device, I envisioned using it as a next-level brain supplement, accessing brilliant trivia during conversations, making myself seem omniscient (or insufferable, or both). This happened only occasionally: I startled a friend with information about the author of a rare sci-fi book, for example. But generally I found that Googling was pretty hard; you mostly control Glass with voice commands, and speaking queries aloud in front of others was awkward.         \n\nThe one thing I used regularly was its camera. I enjoyed taking hands-free shots while playing with my kids and street scenes for which I would probably not have bothered to pull out my phone. I streamed live point-of-view video with friends and family. But it also became clear that the camera is a social bomb. One friend I ran into on the street could focus only on the lens pointing at her. \u201cCan it see into my soul?\u201d she asked. Later, she wrote me an e-mail: \u201cNice to see you. Or spy you spying, I guess.\u201d         \n\nCameras are everywhere in public, but one fixed to your face sends a more menacing signal: I have the power to record you at a moment\u2019s notice, it seems to declare \u2014 and maybe I already am. In the weeks before I got Glass this summer, at least one restaurant banned the device, articles fulminated against it and a parody of its use appeared on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d In public, I sometimes found myself avoiding people\u2019s eyes, as if trying to indicate that I wasn\u2019t recording them. (Of course, if there\u2019s one thing weirder than someone wearing a computer on his face, it\u2019s someone wearing a computer on his face who also refuses to look you in the eye.)         \n\nAs far as Google is concerned, any social quirks, tensions or paranoias Glass produces now are just temporary side effects \u2014 the kind of things we always confront before a new device becomes necessary, accepted, even beloved. Yet there\u2019s always a gulf between how creators intend for their tools to be used and the way people actually use them. There can be a divide, too, between the experience of users and those they interact with. From my perspective, I was wearing a computer, a tool that gave me the constant, easy ability to access information quickly. To everyone else, I was just a guy with a camera on his head. With a technology this strange and new, it\u2019s hard to tell just what it is: a bridge to the rest of the world \u2014 or just another screen blocking people out?         \n\n \n Glass is nothing new. \u201cWe\u2019ve used technology to extend our physicality for thousands of years,\u201d Genevieve Bell, an anthropologist who works for Intel and studies the relationships between people and their digital tools, says. \u201cWe had armor, we had boomerangs to extend our reach, we had bows and arrows.\u201d Women in the 18th and 19th centuries wore chatelaines, bags tied to belts that held the tools of their trade: thermometers and scissors for nurses, thimbles and needles for seamstresses. And as Bell points out, our wearable technologies have never been merely practical enhancements. They\u2019re also theatrical, signaling identity, social status and power. A wristwatch isn\u2019t only a means of promoting punctuality; putting one on is also a way to be seen as a punctual person.
