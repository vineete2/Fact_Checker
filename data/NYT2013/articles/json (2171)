Rock bands do too.         \n\nIn 1979 we feasted on \u201cBreakfast in America,\u201d the commercially successful album by the British rock band Supertramp that launched them to superstardom. Their hit song \u201cGive a Little Bit,\u201d from their 1977 album \u201cEven in the Quietest Moments,\u201d seems like a particularly good fit this holiday season. Sadly, I could find no live YouTube footage of Supertramp performing the song. So I have included a grown-up version of the lead singer  \n (who left the band in \u201983) performing it.         \n\nSkip forward to 1998 when our kids played the  \n nonstop on the Discman. With hits like \u201cIris,\u201d \u201cSlide\u201d and \u201cBlack Balloon,\u201d the band was catapulted into its own superstardom. During a homecoming concert in Buffalo, they covered Supertramp\u2019s \u201cGive a Little Bit.\u201d Today, the band is all grown up and still going strong. Their new album, \u201cMagnetic\u201d (released in June), could be a bridge between their longtime fans and new ones. In a phone chat last weekend with the Dolls\u2019 lead singer, Johnny Rzeznik, I asked what he would like to say to music lovers who don\u2019t know the group yet. \u201cListen to our lyrics,\u201d he said. \u201cI write about everyday people, everyday lives.\u201d         \n\nOn Wednesday, Dec. 4, the Goo Goo Dolls will perform at the Christmas tree lighting at Rockefeller Center, being broadcast on NBC at 8 p.m. Eastern. An additional live hour will be shown on local NBC affiliates in New York and elsewhere at 7 p.m.         \n\nThe band also played in this year\u2019s Hollywood Christmas Parade, which will be shown on the Hallmark Channel on Dec. 11 and on the Hallmark Movie Channel Dec. 20 and 24.         \n\n \n         \nGoo Goo Dolls - Come To Me [Official Music Video] \n\n \n         \n\"Give a Little Bit\" (live in Buffalo, July 4, 2004)  \n\n \n         \nGoo Goo Dolls: \"Come to Me\" (official music video) \nJohn Rzeznik, Goo Goo Dolls: \"Slide\" (live from Daryl's House) \nGoo Goo Dolls: \"Iris\" (official music video) \n\n \n         \n\nCNN  \n         \n\n \n about the making of Supertramp songs.         \n\nInterview with Supertramp\u2019s John Helliwell,  \n and  \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/04/booming/give-a-little-bit-by-hitmakers-supertramp-and-goo-goo-dolls.html", "date": "2013-12-04", "description": "The 1977 song by the British rock band got a new take by the boys from Buffalo."}
