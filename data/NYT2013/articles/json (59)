{"headline": "Drinking Like a Poet", "body": "\nOne chilly evening more than a decade ago, my Glasgow-born-and-bred friend Angus Robertson greeted me at his Brooklyn Heights doorway in his kilt and sporran and welcomed me to my first Burns supper, the Scottish celebration on Jan. 25 that honors the poet Robert Burns. About 20 of us gathered around the haggis (nothing to be afraid of, basically a big mealy sausage), neeps and tatties (that\u2019s turnips and potatoes) and whisky-fortified gravy. Then the time arrived for dessert, poetry, song and whisky. Lots of Scotch whisky, selected with care by our hosts.         \n\nUp to that night, I had nostalgic associations with the blended Scotches favored by my grandfather \u2014 Dewar\u2019s especially \u2014 but I attached a little latent class rage to single malts. Scotch, I thought, was a rich man\u2019s game: the sort of thing that might be found in a still life, in a cut-crystal glass beside a leatherbound book that might never be read. Burns night, then, created some cognitive dissonance. If any writer can be regarded as a poet of the people, it\u2019s Burns \u2014 \u201cthe Ploughman Poet,\u201d a farmer\u2019s son \u2014 who taught us that freedom and whisky go together. The best Burns suppers \u201care the home kind, without any pomp or pretension whatsoever,\u201d says another Glaswegian and an artist, Lex Braes, who always includes a group reading of Burns\u2019s \u201cTam O\u2019Shanter,\u201d which, he says, is \u201ca great cautionary tale of the demon drink.\u201d (Braes\u2019s and Burns\u2019s tongues were at least partly in cheek.)         \n\nBurns night is the perfect opportunity to consider Scotch\u2019s tremendous variety, from mellow and gentle to vegetal and even barnyardy, and up through to the big, peaty, smoky numbers that many people think of first when they think Scotch (see below for a range of recommendations). While the evening highlights whisky served neat \u2014 but with a pitcher of water alongside it, which often helps to open up its flavors \u2014 there\u2019s no reason not to kick the festivities off with a Rabbie Burns cocktail, which adds vermouth, B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine and a bit of citrus. A Rob Roy (a variation on the Manhattan, with Scotch) is also a fine choice. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that the Rob Roy was created not on a windswept Hebridean isle but at the Waldorf Hotel in New York City in 1894.         \n\nWhat\u2019s not to love about a holiday that celebrates a poet? Or one that demands generous quantities of whisky? Burns might have answered the latter question long ago: \u201cO thou, my muse!/guid auld Scotch drink!/Whether thro\u2019 wimplin worms thou jink,/Or, richly brown, ream owre the brink.\u201d Got that? Me, neither. But that won\u2019t stop me from raising a glass this week.         \n\n \n         \n\n1 one-inch strip of orange peel         \n\n1 1/2 ounces Dewar\u2019s White Label         \n\n1/2 ounce Carpano Antica sweet vermouth         \n\n3 dashes B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine.         \n\nRub the rim of a cocktail glass with the orange peel. Shake the other ingredients in a glass with ice. Strain into the cocktail glass and garnish with the reserved peel.         \n\n \n         \n\nI asked my two favorite Scotsmen, Lex Braes and Angus Robertson, to tell me their favorite whiskies for their Burns suppers (and I added my own choices).         \n\n \n ($60): Complex, peaty, a little oily, tinged with sea salt and a honeyed sweetness.         \n\n \n ($67): Earthy, laced with smoke and toasty barley.         \n\n \n ($58): Bright and friendly, with hints of vanilla and brown sugar.         \n\n \n ($65): Smoky and ashy, with a burst of dark spice.
