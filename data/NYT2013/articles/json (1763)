{"headline": "Pettitte Up Next as Dynasty Nears End", "body": "\nIf Hall of Fame starters are supposed to be durable, dominant winners, then Andy Pettitte just misses the cut. But he pitched a long time and won a lot, and that made him an indelible Yankee great.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had the success that I\u2019ve had because of so many great players that have been around me,\u201d Pettitte said Friday in announcing that this would be his final season.         \n\n\u201cDo I feel like I\u2019ve dominated this sport as a pitcher? No, I don\u2019t. Every outing for me, I feel like, has been an absolute grind, to tell you the truth. When I look at lineups and teams that I\u2019m facing, it seems like every hitter\u2019s hitting .300 off of me, you know?\u201d         \n\nIt was vintage Pettitte, the moment in his news conference when you smiled and laughed a little, because you knew the sincerity behind the self-deprecation. It was mostly true, too. Not only did Pettitte never pitch a no-hitter, but he also never pitched a one- or a two-hitter. Opponents batted .270 off him. The league average over his career: .264.         \n\nPettitte had easy days, like all good pitchers, but not many. His self-evaluation was accurate. What separated Pettitte was the way he kept pushing himself to find a way out of trouble, pulling that cap down and fighting. He knew that the worst punishment he could give himself would be to disappoint his teammates, an unpardonable sin.         \n\n\u201cWe laugh at him, because he\u2019s always yelling at himself and talking to himself on the mound,\u201d Derek Jeter said Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s fun watching him beat himself up, because he expects to be perfect. Nobody\u2019s perfect, but he has those expectations, and that\u2019s the reason why he\u2019s had so much success.\u201d         \n\nIt is fitting that Pettitte\u2019s most impressive statistic is his winning percentage \u2014 .627, at 103 games over .500. Wins and losses are often out of a pitcher\u2019s control, as more and more young pitchers recognize. If they work seven innings, allow two runs and lose, they understand they have still done a good job.         \n\nPettitte never believed that. It was comical, indeed, to listen to him berate himself after such games, knowing that, had the offense scored a few more runs, his outlook would have been so different. Pettitte accepted all the responsibility, as he did in 2008 for his use of human growth hormone, the blot on an otherwise sterling reputation.         \n\n\u201cI know my heart, and I\u2019ll tell you, I\u2019ve never tried to cheat this game,\u201d Pettitte said Friday.         \n\nPettitte retired once before, for the 2011 season. He said Friday that he would have stayed retired had General Manager Brian Cashman not called him the next spring. He intended to pitch only in 2012, but when he lost most of that season to a broken leg, he came back.         \n\nAll along, he said, he has known this would be it. He let another retiring Yankee, Mariano Rivera, have the spotlight all season, in every city, and said he planned to retire with a simple announcement the day after the season. Over lunch with Rivera in Toronto this week, Pettitte decided to make the announcement now.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cIt\u2019s giving him a chance to say thanks to the fans.\u201d         \n\nBarring a miracle playoff berth, Pettitte will pitch his final home game as a Yankee on Sunday, when the team honors Rivera. Jorge Posada last played in 2011, choking up by his locker after the playoff finale. Only Jeter will remain from the title teams of more than a decade ago, assuming he picks up his player option, as he has said he intends to do.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long, hard year,\u201d said Pettitte, 41, who is 10-10 with a 3.93 earned run average. \u201cI can\u2019t be happier with my decision. I\u2019ve been retired and I know what it\u2019s going to be like. It\u2019s awesome, and I love it.\u201d         \n\nJeter, who turns 40 in June, has never seemed tempted by retirement. He came up in 1995, like Pettitte, Rivera and Posada, but unlike them, he has no wife or children. Baseball may not be his entire life, but it is all he lets the public see, and he has made no concession to age.         \n\nIf Jeter\u2019s ankle bothers him this winter, as he prepares for the season, you have to wonder if he would put himself through another year like this, which he has described as a nightmare. It is not in Jeter\u2019s nature to want a gauzy farewell tour, and it\u2019s no fun for him to be a figure of sympathy.         \n\nJeter rightly said that it was unrealistic to ever expect another foursome of long-term, mostly one-team stars to reach the majors together. \u201cYou always need to have an influx of young players come in and help organizations,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how we were able to be successful, and I think that\u2019s how any organization can continue or maintain success throughout the years.\u201d         \n\nThe Yankees, however, do not appear to have any stars on the immediate horizon. If they did, those players would have been among the 56 to suit up for the team this season. Compounding the problem is the team\u2019s goal to reduce its bloated payroll.         \n\nRivera and Pettitte clear salary by leaving, and in some ways that helps. But mostly they leave an organization at a point of deep uncertainty, content with their decisions and secure in their legacy.         \n\n\u201cIt just feels right,\u201d Pettitte said. \u201cI just feel like my time here is done. My run\u2019s over.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/21/sports/baseball/yankees-pettitte-is-set-to-announce-his-retirement.html", "date": "2013-09-20", "description": "Andy Pettitte said he struggled with the timing of his announcement because he did not want to take away from Mariano Rivera\u2019s final home game on Sunday."}
