{"headline": "Statutory Rape, Twitter and a Connecticut Town\u2019s  Divide", "body": "\nTORRINGTON, Conn. \u2014 Two 18-year-old high school football players had been arrested, accused of the statutory rape of two 13-year-old girls. Their friends then rallied to their defense, attacking the girls on Twitter. And so, when the Twitter posts brought national condemnation to this old mill town, the principal of Torrington High School decided it was time to appeal to her students\u2019 better natures.         \n\nIn  \n, the principal, Joanne R. Creedon, urged the students to \u201cget that spotlight on the good.\u201d Among other student-sponsored good deeds, she said, the Interact Club was holding a dodgeball tournament for charity that Friday. \u201cCome out for one of these events, have fun, and show everyone what T.H.S. is really about,\u201d she wrote.         \n\nThe dodgeball tournament seemed to go off without a hitch. But the next Monday, the winning team appeared in a picture on the front page of The Register Citizen, the local newspaper \u2014 extending their fingers in 2\u2019s and 1\u2019s, for the \u201c21\u201d on the football jersey of one of the accused players, Edgar Gonzalez, who remains in jail.         \n\nThe paper had found the photo on Instagram. Someone had posted it with a label: #FreeEdgar.         \n\nThe older residents of Torrington, a city of 36,000 in northwestern Connecticut bypassed by economic recovery, would like their town to be known for its middle-class values, for the way people lend a hand to their neighbors. But they have seemed helpless as Torrington has become synonymous with  \n, the defiant Twitter hashtag that has come to stand for everything the teenagers believe is wrong with the arrests \u2014 and everything outsiders believe is wrong with the town.         \n\nWhen  \n  \n teenagers\u2019 Twitter messages defending Mr. Gonzalez and the other football player, Joan Toribio, both seniors, on March 20, a minor scandal became a town preoccupation. It brought unavoidable if rough comparisons to the  \n last year, where repeated violations of a teenage girl were chronicled in social media.         \n\nIn the last two weeks, two 17-year-old boys were arrested, charged, like the 18-year-olds, with sexual assault involving 13-year-old girls. All along, social media have continued to buzz, and Torrington\u2019s parents and  \n have been left to play catch-up, trying to bridge a generational divide that has never felt so sharp here before.         \n\nTwitter accounts normally used to complain about homework, to chatter and to flirt were instead used to accuse the girls of \u201cdestroying\u201d the young men\u2019s lives. \u201cSnitch,\u201d they called one girl, asking why only the male students were being prosecuted if she, too, said yes to having sexual relations. Some people worry that the two girls, who were sending Twitter messages back and forth and to the young men until early February, not long before the first arrests, have seen the messages about them.         \n\n\u201cYoung girls acting like whores there\u2019s no punishment for that,\u201d one student posted the day after Mr. Gonzalez\u2019s arrest on Feb. 20, continuing, \u201cyoung men acting like boys is a sentence.\u201d         \n\nMany adults in the community have been aghast at the posts, particularly those attacking the girls. They also have expressed frustration that many teenagers do not understand the statutory rape law, which is predicated on the notion that juveniles are not mature enough to consent to sex with an older partner. The furor prompted Kenneth Traub, the Board of Education chairman, to convene a community forum on sexual assault, with members of the Police Department and sexual assault counselors.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hard time in Torrington right now,\u201d said Barbara Spiegel, executive director of the  \n, a center here for battered women and victims of sexual assault.         \n\nSchool officials have asked Ms. Spiegel\u2019s counselors to meet with students, including those in the dodgeball photo, acknowledging that administrators must try to change teenagers\u2019 attitudes without being able to regulate what they say online. At Torrington Middle School, where the two victims are in eighth grade, administrators also called an assembly to warn against online \u201cname-calling.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not completely uncharted territory, but it\u2019s new,\u201d Ms. Spiegel said. \u201cA while back it was Myspace, and then it was Facebook, and then it was sexting, and now it\u2019s Twitter.\u201d         \n\nThe school superintendent, Cheryl F. Kloczko, has urged parents to speak to their children, telling them that inappropriate posts can result in suspension or expulsion. But no students, Mr. Traub said, have yet gone before the board for a social-media-related expulsion hearing. (Mr. Traub said he did not know whether there had been any suspensions, and Ms. Kloczko declined to comment.)         \n\nAdding to the district\u2019s challenges is that while there is plenty of speculation online about the statutory rape case, there is little official information. The police have said only that the arrests of Mr. Toribio and Mr. Gonzalez, both residents of a modest housing complex known as Highwoods, stemmed from separate episodes around Feb. 10; one of the victims\u2019 parents reported an assault to the police on Feb. 11.
