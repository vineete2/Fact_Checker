{"headline": "Lundqvist\u2019s Deal With Rangers Is \u2018From the Heart\u2019 ", "body": "\nGREENBURGH, N.Y. \u2014 Henrik Lundqvist said he wanted to be a Ranger for life, and now he will have that chance. The Rangers announced Wednesday that Lundqvist had signed a seven-year contract extension, ending speculation that he might depart when his contract expired at the end of the N.H.L. season.         \n\n\u201cI know there\u2019s been some speculation,\u201d Lundqvist said at a news conference at the Rangers\u2019 practice rink. \u201cBut from the heart, it was never an option to leave this club.\u201d         \n\nThe new deal, for $59.5 million, with an $8.5 million annual salary-cap hit, makes Lundqvist the highest-paid Ranger and the highest-paid goalie in the N.H.L. It represents a significant raise from his old contract, which had a $6.875 million cap hit per year. Lundqvist turns 32 in March, meaning he will be 39 if he stays through the term of the contract, which is one year shorter than the maximum allowed by the new collective bargaining agreement.         \n\nThe importance of re-signing Lundqvist was underscored by the presence of the team owner James L. Dolan at the news conference. Dolan, who rarely attends functions pertaining to hockey matters but who is a lifelong Rangers fan, called Lundqvist \u201ca model of what you want in a player\u201d and said he was pleased that Lundqvist would wear Rangers blue for the rest of his career.         \n\nLundqvist,  \n \u2014 on this occasion, he was impeccably dressed in a well-tailored suit \u2014 smiled as he stood alongside General Manager Glen Sather.         \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a great guy, he\u2019s a great competitor, he\u2019s great in the magazines, and we\u2019re excited to have him here,\u201d Sather said. \u201cSo it\u2019s up to you, Henrik \u2014 now just carry us on your shoulders.\u201d         \n\nSather\u2019s assessment was an accurate measure of how vital Lundqvist has been to the Rangers since coming from Sweden in 2005.         \n\nIn some of his eight seasons, he almost single-handedly willed the Rangers into the playoffs. He has been named the team\u2019s most valuable player seven times. Lundqvist, the N.H.L.\u2019s most consistently excellent goalie, has won a Vezina Trophy and was a finalist for the award four other times, and he has finished among the top 10 in save percentage six times. He also won an Olympic gold medal with Sweden at the 2006 Games in Turin, Italy, and will be his country\u2019s No. 1 goalie at the Games in February in Sochi, Russia.         \n\nBut the Stanley Cup has eluded him.         \n\n\u201cI really want to win a Cup here in New York,\u201d Lundqvist said. \u201cIt\u2019s my biggest goal and my biggest dream.\u201d         \n\nThe re-signing came after a minor controversy this week. Coach Alain Vigneault started the backup Cam Talbot in a second straight game in a  \n to the Winnipeg Jets on Monday. It was the first time a healthy Lundqvist had sat out two straight games since the 2010-11 season.         \n\nBut on Wednesday, Vigneault seemed to have put that experiment in the past.         \n\n\u201cWhat do they say \u2014 happy wife, happy life?\u201d Vigneault said. \u201cHappy goalie, happy team.\u201d         \n\nAsked if he had decided who would play goal in the Rangers\u2019 game at Buffalo on Thursday, Vigneault said it was \u201cpretty obvious I\u2019m going with Hank.\u201d         \n\nAfter a shaky start this season, Lundqvist has registered a .930 save percentage in his last 13 appearances. But he has continued to allow the occasional soft goal and expressed dissatisfaction with his performance. He said again Wednesday that the contract talks were not a factor in his play this season.         \n\n\u201cDuring the summer, I probably thought about it every day, and going into training camp it was definitely there,\u201d Lundqvist said. \u201cWhen it didn\u2019t happen, for a couple days it was on my mind. But then I let it go.\u201d         \n\nSather said he was talking with the representatives for the seven pending unrestricted free agents still on the roster: the captain Ryan Callahan, Dan Girardi, Anton Stralman, Brian Boyle, Taylor Pyatt, Dominic Moore and Benoit Pouliot.         \n\n\u201cIn my mind, Henrik was the one that had to be signed first,\u201d Sather said.         \n\nCallahan, Girardi and Stralman said they were not thinking about their own contract situations.         \n\n\u201cThis is where I want to be, obviously, but I just go about my business on my ice, and that stuff takes care of itself,\u201d Callahan said.         \n\n\u201cHank\u2019s paying for dinner, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d he added, unable to resist a quip.         \n\nLundqvist\u2019s new contract eats up significant salary-cap space and could make it difficult to re-sign Callahan, who makes $4.275 million in his expiring contract, and Girardi, a top defenseman, who makes $3.325 million. A $4.9 billion Canadian television contract signed last week with Rogers Communications is expected to provide more cap space in coming seasons.         \n\nSather said that television deal would probably raise the salary ceiling, \u201cbut you still have to be careful.\u201d He added that Lundqvist could have earned if he signed elsewhere as a free agent.         \n\nSather recalled the time some nine years ago when he traveled to Gothenburg, Sweden, to watch Lundqvist play for Frolunda, his hometown club.         \n\n\u201cI asked him after that game if he was ready to be in New York,\u201d Sather said. \u201cAnd in his sophisticated, elegant way, he said, \u2018Absolutely.\u2019 And it was clear in my mind that this guy was going to be a great goaltender.\u201d         \n\nLundqvist noted that when he was growing up, Frolunda was his favorite team.         \n\n\u201cNow the love and respect I have for the Rangers organization is just what I had for that club, if not more, and that means a lot,\u201d Lundqvist said. \u201cTo stay with one club throughout your career is very special, and something I put a lot of value to.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/05/sports/rangers-sign-lundqvist-to-seven-year-extension.html", "date": "2013-12-04", "description": "Goalie Henrik Lundqvist, 31, who could have been a free agent at the end of the N.H.L. season, agreed to a deal worth $59.5 million."}
