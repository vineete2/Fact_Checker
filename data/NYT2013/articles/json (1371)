{"headline": "Tenants Worried by Plans to Build Near City Projects", "body": "\nWhen Hassan Adam was growing up in public housing on the Lower East Side of  \n, his playground was a nearby recreational yard in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge, where residents have long played basketball and neighbors hold an annual \u201cfamily day.\u201d Mr. Adam still lives in the project, and he taught his daughter to ride a bike in the play area.         \n\nBut soon, that patch of asphalt at the  \n could be replaced by market-rate apartment buildings. And tenants like Mr. Adam, 37, said they feared what could come next.         \n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll make our buildings condos,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to move us.\u201d         \n\nThe  \n, facing one of the most serious financial shortfalls in its history, is for the first time  \n to lease open land on the grounds of its housing projects to developers to generate revenue.         \n\nThe authority wants to raise more than $50 million a year on long-term leases for parks, courtyards, parking lots, playgrounds and other property, seeking to address a $6 billion backlog of repairs.         \n\nBut the plan has stirred deep concern, if not paranoia, among tenants who have been warily eying gentrification in one of the nation\u2019s most expensive housing markets. The proposal is initially directed at eight housing projects in Manhattan near the waterfront and other prime areas where real estate values have jumped.         \n\nThe authority has repeatedly told tenants that it has no plans to sell buildings themselves, and that no public housing tenant will be displaced by the new policy.         \n\nStill, in a city that teems with real estate anxieties, the tenants harbor their own.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always an ongoing rumor that Trump is going to buy the buildings,\u201d said Damaris Reyes, 41, a community organizer on the Lower East Side who lives in the  \n. \u201cIf a white man in a suit that no one has seen before walks through the development, the next thing we hear is, \u2018They\u2019re looking at the buildings to buy them.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nTenants also said they were alarmed about the potential loss of open space, especially for children and the elderly.         \n\nThe plan has not yet been formally adopted by the authority\u2019s board, and approval by the federal government is also required. Furthermore, it is not clear whether developers will flock to lease land for market-rate buildings so close to public housing.         \n\nAuthority officials have held meetings in recent weeks with tenants and members of the City Council to try to calm them about the plan\u2019s impact.         \n\nIn his  \n address last month, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said that the alternative would be to allow public housing buildings \u201cto crumble\u201d or to \u201cknock them down.\u201d         \n\nThe plan is part of a broader effort to close the authority\u2019s budget gaps that includes raising rents for some tenants and leasing retail space on the ground floor of some buildings.         \n\nThe authority, landlord to more than 400,000 residents, has a backlog of about 350,000 repair orders. It also has a waiting list of 160,000 families. The authority\u2019s chairman, John B. Rhea, whom Mr. Bloomberg appointed, said his agency  \n to address both an operating deficit of $60 million in its current budget and $6 billion in capital needs.         \n\n\u201cThis is the single largest opportunity to preserve public housing units and our buildings,\u201d Mr. Rhea said, referring to the proposal to lease the land.         \n\nAsked about the fears of tenants, he emphasized that \u201cthe plan is not a plan to privatize public housing.\u201d         \n\nThe authority is proposing 4,000 to 5,000 private apartments on 13 parcels of land at eight projects \u2014 about three million square feet in all. Of those apartments, 20 percent or up to 1,000, would be designated as affordable. The eight projects, with a combined population of more than 25,000 people, are Alfred E. Smith, Baruch, Campos Plaza, Fiorello LaGuardia and Meltzer in Lower Manhattan; Carver and Washington on the Upper East Side; and Douglass on the Upper West Side.         \n\nFred Harris, the housing authority\u2019s executive vice president for real estate and development, said officials were looking at projects in other boroughs for similar development sites.         \n\nSome public housing advocates acknowledged that the city had few options as it confronts a sharp drop in federal aid \u2014 a total of more than $1.5 billion since 2001.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough choice because the money would support the rest of the system,\u201d said Edward Josephson, director of litigation with Legal Services NYC. \u201cIf you keep the parking lot and the rest of the project falls into pieces, that\u2019s worse.\u201d         \n\nNew York has done more than most localities to preserve its public housing. In other cities, high-rise buildings, let alone parking lots, have been sold off or demolished.         \n\nStill, the prospect of high-income neighbors at their doorsteps has moved some tenant associations in  \n to hire lawyers and appeal to elected officials to intercede.         \n\nA group headed by Representative Carolyn B. Maloney of Manhattan and Representative Nydia M. Vel\u00e1zquez of Brooklyn, both Democrats, asked the Bloomberg administration to postpone a request for proposals from developers scheduled to go out by April to allow for more consultation with tenants.         \n\nAt a raucous tenants\u2019 meeting last month attended by more than 300 people, tenant leaders said they were worried about higher retail prices as stores cater to high-earning newcomers. They said their communities could lose city services for the poor and political clout as ZIP codes become more affluent.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be foreigners in our own homes,\u201d said Aixa O. Torres, the tenants\u2019 president at the Alfred E. Smith Houses, with 12 buildings and nearly 2,000 apartments.         \n\nDespite the authority\u2019s assurances, some tenants said they were convinced that the plan was the first step in a process that would lead to their eviction.         \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to have people who are paying market rent to want to live in the same place as low-income people,\u201d said Thelma R. Yearwood, the residents\u2019 president at  \n, a building for elderly people on the Lower East Side that is to lose its only park under the plan. \u201cThey\u2019ll find a way to transfer people out of here.\u201d         \n\nDereese Huff, president of the tenant association at  \n, said she favored the plan \u201cif it\u2019s going to help me get windows in my development.\u201d         \n\nJessica Thomas, tenant association president at  \n on the Lower East Side near Chinatown, said that her project needed new entrance doors, but that she would oppose the trade-off.         \n\nMs. Thomas, 62, said she had opposed installing racks at LaGuardia for the city\u2019s bike-sharing program because they would be \u201cjust a toe in the door\u201d for wealthier newcomers drawn by the growing list of attractions along the nearby East River.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s South Street Seaport,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re building on the waterfront on the F.D.R. Drive. Gorgeous. Now we have Basketball City across the street. They\u2019re connecting to Pier 42. Who wouldn\u2019t want to live here?\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/12/nyregion/plan-to-lease-open-land-at-housing-projects-stirs-concern.html", "date": "2013-03-11", "description": "New York City wants to raise revenue by leasing open land on the grounds of its housing projects, stirring deep concerns among residents wary of gentrification."}
