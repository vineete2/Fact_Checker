{"headline": "In Battle Over Malibu Beaches, an App Unlocks Access", "body": "\nMALIBU, Calif. \u2014 The battle between Malibu beachfront homeowners and a less privileged public that wants to share the stunning coastline has been fought with padlocks, gates, menacing signs, security guards, lawsuits and bulldozers. There seems little question who is winning: 20 of the 27 miles of  \n are inaccessible to the public.         \n\nYet this month, the homeowners \u2014 including some of the wealthiest and most famous people in the country, but also a hearty colony of surfers, stoners and old-fashioned beach lovers \u2014 are confronting what may be the biggest threat to their privacy yet.         \n\nThe smartphone.         \n\nJenny Price, an environmental writer who has pressed the battle to open hidden beaches, has developed  \n offering a beach-by-beach battle plan for anyone wishing to explore what are, by design, some of the most secluded beaches around. It has maps to often hidden entry gates, house-by-house descriptions showing public property boundaries and spine-stiffening advice on dealing with counterfeit no-parking signs (\u201cfeel free to enjoy and then ignore\u201d) and threatening property owners (\u201cthey\u2019re welcome to call the sheriff\u201d).         \n\n \n in a  \n is stirring questions of land use, property rights and privilege that have long been a source of tension in Southern California, a fight made all the more alluring because long stretches of beachfront are owned by well-known Hollywood figures, including  \n,  \n and  \n.         \n\nBy state law, California beaches are public property, though the dividing line between private property and public beach is as changeable as the high-tide mark and the easements a homeowner is granted for development rights. And the beachfront homes in Malibu tend to be crammed together, making it impossible to catch even a glimpse of long stretches of the beach, much less walk onto it.         \n\n\u201cI sort of see this as one of the most egregious problems we have with public space in a region that\u2019s plagued with problems with public space,\u201d Ms. Price said as she walked along Carbon Beach, lined with glistening estates, the only sign of life being the clip-clip-clip of the occasional landscaper.         \n\nLater, strolling along Malibu Road Beach as the sun cracked through the morning marine layer, Ms. Price stopped in front of a house that had seven variations of a \u201cno trespassing\u201d sign. \u201cYou need to stand behind the tide line,\u201d she said. \u201cLast time we were here, the owner called the sheriff.\u201d         \n\nThe release of the  \n has set off waves of anxiety among homeowners here, fearful that a high-tech weapon in a long-fought war will open the gates on what has been a largely secret world. The despair cuts across demographic lines. Malibu is a more complicated place than is commonly portrayed, a mixture of the very wealthy and people who bought relatively modest homes and cabins here a generation ago and hung on.         \n\n\u201cThere are plenty of places that have bathrooms, lifeguards, parking,\u201d said Wendy Ledner, who grew up on Malibu Road Beach. \u201cThere are none of those facilities at these beaches. People come through, they urinate, defecate, they leave their garbage \u2014 there are no garbage pails. They can\u2019t park; there is no parking, so they block driveways.\u201d         \n\nArnold G. York, the publisher of The Malibu Times, said the uproar was feeding long-held and incorrect stereotypes about the community. \u201cOne of the things that makes for a wonderful story is how Malibu is elitist and we don\u2019t want anyone here,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reality is we get 15 million people coming out each year to the beaches. The biggest problem is not access but parking.\u201d         \n\nHe said he understood the concern of homeowners that these remote and often small beaches, some with rough surf and jagged rock formations, were not made to accommodate large influxes of sun-seekers.         \n\nA drive through Malibu testifies to the utility of such a guide. Although there are some parking spaces, particularly along the Pacific Coast Highway, there are not many, and beachgoers have to compete with homeowners and people who work on the estates. And wily homeowners drop orange cones on the street or build fake garage doors to block off what are, in fact, legal parking spots. One beach access gate was mostly obscured by hedges planted by property owners.         \n\nThe gates are often weighted down with all kinds of signs, some legitimate, some not. \u201cRight to pass by permission and subject to control of owner,\u201d a sign at Lechuza Beach, fell in the latter category.         \n\nThere are 17 public access ways to the Malibu coastline. Under state law, there should be more than 100. The last time one was opened was in 2005.         \n\n\u201cThere is a lot of resistance to opening new access ways; there are 15 additional easements that have yet to be opened,\u201d said Linda Locklin, who leads the coastal access program for the  \n. \u201cOur record is frankly not so good. It takes us forever to open them.\u201d         \n\nMuch of the information in the Malibu beach app has been available to the public, but in the form of bulky, 300-page regional coastal guides, which cost $25 apiece.         \n\nMs. Locklin called the app \u201ca big deal\u201d that would greatly advance the commission\u2019s goal of making these beaches more accessible. It is easier to use than the books and, at least for now, free. (An Android version of the app is expected to be released in the fall and cost $1.99.)         \n\nThis tug of war has always had overtones of class warfare. One of the beaches is known as Billionaires\u2019 Beach, and Ms. Price has named the access way to that beach \u201cHurray for Hollywood.\u201d Still, she said she resisted any attempt to frame the battle along those lines, even as she stood in front of the home of Mr. Geffen, who at first fought the coastal commission when it tried to open a public walkway by his home.         \n\n\u201cEven Geffen, despite his fake garages, he\u2019s been a decent neighbor, and I don\u2019t call him out,\u201d Ms. Price said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about who lives down here. It\u2019s not a take-down-the-billionaires project. This is not a political statement. People are constantly asking us, \u2018Can you show us Pierce Brosnan\u2019s house?\u2019 Yeah \u2014 but no.\u201d         \n\nMs. Price cast her arm across Billionaires\u2019 Beach. \u201cThis is one of the premier beaches, and look how many people have come,\u201d she said, pointing to a largely empty swatch of beach. \u201cThe hordes have not descended.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/13/us/in-battle-over-malibu-beaches-an-app-unlocks-access.html", "date": "2013-06-12", "description": "The app, which has maps that point the way to hidden entry gates, escalates the war between homeowners and a less-privileged public that wants to share the California coastline."}
