{"headline": "On the Edge of Poverty, at the Center of a Debate on Food Stamps", "body": "\nDYERSBURG, Tenn. \u2014 As a self-described \u201ctrue Southern man\u201d \u2014 and reluctant recipient of food stamps \u2014 Dustin Rigsby, a struggling mechanic, hunts deer, doves and squirrels to help feed his family. He shops for grocery bargains, cooks budget-stretching stews and limits himself to one meal a day.         \n\nTarnisha Adams, who left her job skinning hogs at a slaughterhouse when she became ill with cancer, gets $352 a month in food stamps for herself and three college-age sons. She buys discount meat and canned vegetables, cheaper than fresh. Like Mr. Rigsby, she eats once a day \u2014 \u201cif I eat,\u201d she said.         \n\nWhen Congress officially returns to Washington next week, the diets of families like the Rigsbys and the Adamses will be caught up in a debate over deficit reduction. Republicans, alarmed by a rise in food stamp enrollment, are pushing to revamp and scale down the program. Democrats are resisting the cuts.         \n\nNo matter what Congress decides, benefits will be reduced in November, when a provision in the 2009 stimulus bill expires.         \n\nYet as lawmakers cast the fight in terms of spending, nonpartisan budget analysts and hunger relief advocates warn of a spike in \u201cfood insecurity\u201d among Americans who, as Mr. Rigsby said recently, \u201clook like we are fine,\u201d but live on the edge of poverty, skipping meals and rationing food.         \n\nSurrounded by corn and soybean farms \u2014 including one owned by the local Republican congressman, Representative Stephen Fincher \u2014 Dyersburg, about 75 miles north of Memphis, provides an eye-opening view into Washington\u2019s food stamp debate. Mr. Fincher, who was elected in 2010 on a Tea Party wave and collected nearly $3.5 million in farm subsidies from the government from 1999 to 2012, recently voted for a farm bill that omitted food stamps.         \n\n\u201cThe role of citizens, of Christianity, of humanity, is to take care of each other, not for Washington to steal from those in the country and give to others in the country,\u201d Mr. Fincher, whose office did not respond to interview requests, said after his vote in May. In response to a Democrat who invoked the Bible during the food stamp debate in Congress, Mr. Fincher cited  \n. \u201cThe one who is unwilling to work shall not eat,\u201d he said.         \n\nOn Wednesday, the Department of Agriculture released a  \n showing that nearly 49 million Americans were living in \u201cfood insecure\u201d households \u2014 meaning, in the bureaucratic language of the agency, that some family members lacked \u201cconsistent access throughout the year to adequate food.\u201d In short, many Americans went hungry. The agency found the figures essentially unchanged since the economic downturn began in 2008, but substantially higher than during the previous decade.         \n\nExperts say the problem is particularly acute in rural regions like Dyersburg, a city of 17,000 on the banks of the Forked Deer River in West Tennessee. More than half the counties with the highest concentration of food insecurity are rural, according to an  \n, the nation\u2019s largest network of food banks. In Dyer County, it found, 19.4 percent of residents were \u201cfood insecure\u201d in 2011, compared with 16.4 percent nationwide.         \n\nOver all, nearly 48 million Americans now receive food stamps, an $80 billion-a-year program that is increasingly the target of conservatives. Robert Rector, a scholar at the conservative  \n, argues that the food stamp program should be overhauled so that benefits are tied to work, much as welfare was revamped under President Bill Clinton. He advocates mandatory drug testing for food stamp recipients \u2014 a position that draws support from Mr. Rigsby, who dreams of becoming a game warden and said it irritated him to see people \u201cmooch off the system.\u201d         \n\nBut when benefits drop in November, the Rigsbys, who say they receive about $350 a month, can expect $29 less.         \n\n\u201cPeople have a lot of misimpressions about hunger in America,\u201d said Maura Daly, a Feeding America spokeswoman. \u201cPeople think it\u2019s associated with homelessness when, in fact, it is working poor families, it\u2019s kids, it\u2019s the disabled.\u201d Hunger is often invisible, she said, and in rural areas it is even more so.         \n\nHunger was easy to see on a recent morning in Dyersburg. Hundreds of people, many of them food stamp recipients, lined up at the county fairgrounds for boxes of free food \u2014 21,000 pounds of meat, potatoes, grains and produce \u2014 that had been trucked in from a food bank in Memphis. About 80 volunteers set up an assembly line in a warehouse to distribute the food.         \n\nMore than 700 families get help each month from the charitable program,  \n, which was founded in 2009 by Mark Oakes, the chairman of the local Salvation Army, after a string of nearby factories closed.         \n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t absorb the work force back into our community,\u201d Mr. Oakes said, \u201cand people were hungry.\u201d         \n\nAmong the first in line at the fairgrounds was Kathy Baucom, 61, a former welder disabled by lupus. She lives alone in a trailer, hunts deer \u2014 \u201clast year I bagged seven,\u201d she said \u2014 and makes burgers, roasts and jerky out of venison. Her food stamp benefits of $125 a month were recently reduced to $117.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t buy milk because it\u2019s so expensive,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t buy cheese.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/05/us/as-debate-reopens-food-stamp-recipients-continue-to-squeeze.html", "date": "2013-09-04", "description": "As lawmakers cast a fight over cuts to food stamps in terms of spending, budget analysts and hunger relief advocates warn of a spike in \u201cfood insecurity\u201d among Americans."}
