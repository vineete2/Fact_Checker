{"headline": "At a Philippine Hospital, Survivors Face Quiet Despair", "body": "\nTACLOBAN, the Philippines \u2014 Richard Pulga, a 27-year-old farmer with thick black hair and a gentle manner, has been lying on a hard steel bed in a dark hallway of the main hospital here since Saturday with a shattered lower right leg, abdominal pain and his right eye filling with blood.         \n\nOne of the first victims of Typhoon Haiyan to be brought to the  \n, Mr. Pulga was given just an intravenous drip \u2014 a bag of saline solution to prevent dehydration. No painkillers, no antibiotics, not even antiseptic to dress the purple, bulging wound on his calf.         \n\nHe needs an X-ray to assess the damage to his leg. Miraculously, the hospital\u2019s X-ray machine made it intact through the typhoon and accompanying storm surge, which partly flooded the hospital\u2019s main floor.         \n\nBut the hospital lacks even the electricity to turn the machine on to check if it works. The only source of power is a gasoline generator the size of a small clothes dryer, which powers the lights in the emergency room and a simple operating room.         \n\nFood is in short supply \u2014 Mr. Pulga receives just two small bowls of rice porridge a day. \u201cThe government should do more for me and fellow victims,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough, we\u2019re almost starving here.\u201d         \n\nAlmost everyone in Tacloban, a city of 220,000 that absorbed the heaviest blow from the typhoon, has lost family members; Jerry T. Yaokasin, the vice mayor, estimated that 90 percent of the city\u2019s employees were either killed or injured, or had a family member who was. Many, like Mr. Pulga, were hit by debris scattered by the typhoon, one of the most powerful ever recorded in the Pacific.         \n\nAs he lay on the thin, striped cloth mat that was his only cushion against the bed, Mr. Pulga recounted his odyssey.         \n\nAs the storm approached, Mr. Pulga sent his wife, 7-year-old son and 6-week-old daughter to stay with neighbors in a sturdier home, where they survived without serious injury \u2014 physically, at least. Traumatized and depressed, relatives say, his wife has not yet summoned the strength to visit him at the hospital.         \n\nMr. Pulga stayed behind to guard their small, wood house. He tried to hide from the wind by hunching down behind the back of the house, only to find the wind and rain swirling in from every direction. A large coconut, accelerated to extraordinary speed by gusts that may have exceeded 200 miles per hour, rocketed through the dark and struck his leg, breaking it.         \n\nAs he lay alone and injured, the wind tore the house into little pieces and flung them into the night. He was hit by a chunk of wood that bloodied his eye and cut the right side of his face. His 16-year-old nephew, at the home of one of Mr. Pulga\u2019s sisters, went outside to take a quick look at the storm and was struck by a piece of wood so heavy and sharp and moving so fast that it severed his leg, eventually killing him, Mr. Pulga said.         \n\nA neighbor brought Mr. Pulga first to a village clinic, where a wide, rectangular patch of gauze was firmly pressed to his leg wound with four long strips of white surgical tape. Then the neighbor brought him to the hospital here.         \n\nAs they live roughly two miles from the ocean, they did not have to deal with the 13-foot storm surge that flattened large areas of Tacloban. One of Mr. Pulga\u2019s biggest worries is how to feed his family. The typhoon destroyed the vital rice crop, almost ready for harvest, on the meager two acres that he farms with his sisters and their families. The extended family is mostly women, and Mr. Pulga said that he needed to be healthy to do the heavy work of farming.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any money, I\u2019ve lost everything, even my house is gone,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what is on my mind.\u201d         \n\nThe storm also snapped off most of the coconut palms on his land that help provide sustenance. It will take a few years for them to start producing coconuts again, said Luminada Florendo, Mr. Pulga\u2019s aunt.         \n\nCoconuts, a source of food, fiber and charcoal, become a menace during powerful typhoons. The hospital bed parked in front of Mr. Pulga\u2019s in the hallway held a young man, Junlie Bueno, whose lower back had been broken by a wind-thrown coconut, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down.
