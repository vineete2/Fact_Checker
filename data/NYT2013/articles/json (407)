{"headline": "Senate Vote on Border Gives Push to Immigration Overhaul", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The bipartisan push to overhaul the nation\u2019s immigration laws took a major step forward\u00a0Monday\u00a0evening when the Senate endorsed a proposal to substantially bolster security along the nation\u2019s southern borders as part of a measure that would provide a path to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants already in the country.         \n\nThe 67-to-27 vote prevented any filibuster of the plan to devote roughly $40 billion over the next decade to border enforcement measures, including nearly doubling the number of border agents to 40,000 and completing 700 miles of fencing. Opponents of the measure questioned whether the security steps would ever be taken and said that the legislation should require that the border be secure before undocumented immigrants could seek legal status.         \n\nBut the solid bipartisan support for the border security proposal by two Republican senators, Bob Corker of Tennessee and John Hoeven of North Dakota, suggested that advocates of the overhaul had the votes needed to clear remaining hurdles and pass the legislation, which was drafted by a bipartisan \u201cGang of Eight\u201d senators, perhaps before lawmakers leave town for the July Fourth\u00a0recess.         \n\nSenators and aides said that Monday\u2019s vote offered a preliminary glimpse of how many senators, roughly, would vote for the bill\u2019s final passage. Several senators missed the vote because of flight delays, and Democrats said they could have landed at least 69 votes had all legislators been present.         \n\n\u201cThe bill has been improved dramatically tonight by this vote, there\u2019s no question,\u201d Mr. Corker said. \u201cHopefully there will be other improvements made with other amendments, and my sense is we\u2019re going to pass an immigration bill out of the United States Senate, which will be no doubt historic.\u201d         \n\nEarlier Monday, speaking at the White House to business leaders in favor of the legislation, President Obama called for speedy action: \u201cNow is the time to do it,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe Corker-Hoeven plan helped bring on board more than a dozen Republicans, many of whom said they were reluctant to support any immigration overhaul that did not secure the southern border and guard against a future wave of illegal immigrants. Their amendment will also require a $3.2 billion high-tech border surveillance plan \u2014 including drone aircraft and long-range thermal imaging cameras \u2014 as well as an electronic employment verification system and a visa entry/exit system at all air and sea ports.         \n\nAll those security measures must be in place before any undocumented immigrant can become a legal permanent resident and receive a green card.         \n\nAny final bill passed by the Senate will head to the Republican-controlled House, where it already faces vocal opposition. Speaker John A. Boehner has publicly said that he will not bring any immigration bill up for a vote that does not have the support of a majority of House Republicans. That decision pleased the conservative wing of his caucus but also raises hurdles for any broad immigration bill in the House, where many Republicans oppose any pathway to citizenship.         \n\nMr. Hoeven sounded a note of cautious optimism.         \n\n\u201cI think that we\u2019re on track to move the bill forward and then remember, it\u2019s got to go to the House,\u201d Mr. Hoeven said. \u201cThere\u2019s more work to be done, but we\u2019re working on it, we\u2019re making progress \u2014 more to do \u2014 but we want to continue to improve it in the Senate and likewise in the House.\u201d         \n\nSpeaking earlier on the Senate floor, Mr. Corker urged his colleagues to vote for the amendment, while also reminding them that a \u201cyes\u201d vote on the Corker-Hoeven proposal did not necessarily translate into support for the final legislation.         \n\n\u201cI hope everyone will get behind this,\u201d Mr. Corker said. \u201cI think this puts in place a balance, and I think if this amendment is passed we will be doing something great for our nation.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/25/us/politics/senate-endorses-proposal-calling-for-extra-border-security-measures.html", "date": "2013-06-24", "description": "The Senate, in a major step toward a bipartisan immigration overhaul, endorsed an amendment that would nearly double the Border Patrol force."}
