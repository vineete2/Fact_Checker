{"headline": "When Mom\u2019s Clicks Lead to Love First", "body": "\nWhen my mom started setting up her profile on a dating Web site called Ourtime.com, she was super pumped.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m having so much fun,\u201d she told me over the phone. Taking a bunch of selfies, filling in boxes and overthinking her answers to questions, she asked me what options she had for religion.         \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a Taoist?\u201d she said, pronouncing it with a \u201ct.\u201d I offered her the correct pronunciation.         \n\n\u201cWell, then what\u2019s this yin and yang?\u201d she asked.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a black and white cookie, Mom. Only for your whole life.\u201d         \n\nFor my generation, getting truly excited about an Internet date is kind of gauche. Most of us in big cities like New York view Internet dating the same as paying for public transportation; we\u2019re not crazy about it, but what option do we have? For my mom, this was the future. I wondered if my weird paternal reaction was how she and my late father felt when teenage me began dating. \u201cHe has no idea what\u2019s ahead,\u201d they must have thought, smiling outwardly, but internally shaking their heads.         \n\nRecently single myself, I was back on OkCupid, not just for me, but in solidarity with my mom. If the Britts were unfairly alone in love, then it made sense to try and pool our resources, compare notes and figure out what we were doing wrong.         \n\nWhile Brooklyn and East Village singles grab a whiskey at 11 p.m., the older crowd in the Chandler, Ariz., suburbs where my mom lives, tends to meet when the sun is out. My mom had a Starbucks date in which her guy talked only about his ex-wife. I had a stroll through the Guggenheim with a girl who claimed to \u201chate the sun.\u201d My mom saw a big summer blockbuster with a guy who hogged the popcorn and snorted. I saw \u201cFrancis Ha\u201d with a girl who talked during the scene where Greta Gerwig runs and dances in the streets.         \n\nBut one day, Mom had some news for me. \u201cThere\u2019s a new man in my life,\u201d she said, \u201cI think he might be the one.\u201d This dream dude sounded like an altruistic James Bond supervillain: he worked overseas as a contractor on oil rigs, and as such was in and out of Arizona a lot. He had a deep, gravelly voice, which he said was the result of years and years of having to yell above the din of the machinery, which (I guessed) is just how it went on oil rigs.         \n\n\u201cWell, do you like the way he looks, Mom?\u201d         \n\n\u201cI like the way his pictures look,\u201d she said.         \n\n\u201cWhat? You haven\u2019t met him?\u201d         \n\n\u201cNo, but we\u2019ve talked a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cI told you, he\u2019s out of town a lot on oil rigs.\u201d         \n\n\u201cOh, Mom,\u201d I said. And then, in the same way I was instructed to avoid \u201cstranger danger,\u201d I told her not to take anything too seriously until she had met him. I reminded her that there were plenty of schemes out there on the Internet, and she shouldn\u2019t let herself become so involved that she would tell a bunch of stuff about herself to a person who might be a lot of different people.         \n\nSure enough, he hit my mom up for a $4,000 wire transfer a few days later, mentioning that he lost his wallet and was stuck somewhere in Europe. My worst suspicions were confirmed, and my mom was, to put it mildly, really annoyed.         \n\n\u201cHow could he do that to me,\u201d she said, fuming.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a person, Mom,\u201d I said, \u201cIt\u2019s a scam. There\u2019s probably a whole group of people.\u201d         \n\nOddly, though she waited a few days, Mom was relatively undeterred by this big disappointment. She scheduled more dates than ever before. Bizarrely, I felt as if I needed to up my game too, so I threw myself at my own OkCupid pursuits. If Mom could do it, so could I. Eventually, I snagged an advertising agent who looked like a cross between \u201cFelicity\"-era Keri Russell and Natalie Portman. She started coming over a lot, usually late at night, and generally after we did shots of whiskey at the International Bar, or some other place where you have to yell to order a drink.         \n\nSomewhat inexplicably, after three weeks of crashing at my place and making out with me in bars, she dumped me in front of a movie theater on the Lower East Side. It just wasn\u2019t working, but I suspected it had something to do with us being sober. She didn\u2019t ask me for a weird wire transfer or tell me lies about her background; she just left.         \n\nOn the walk home, I called Mom, and a strange version of her voice answered. She sounded like she was on drugs or committing a murder.         \n\n\u201cOh, hi Ryan,\u201d she said.         \n\n\u201cHi, Mom,\u201d I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d         \n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m in Prescott,\u201d she said. This was odd. Prescott is a solid hour drive from where my mom lived.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m with Ron,\u201d she said, \u201cI met him on Match.com. It\u2019s much better than Ourtime.\u201d         \n\nIn the middle of the Bowery, I stopped walking and put my free hand over my mouth, the way people do in bad movies when something shocking happens. I moved it under my chin and then to the side of my face, as if I were holding up my head.         \n\n\u201cO.K., Mom,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d         \n\n\u201cO.K., sweetie,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll call you soon.\u201d         \n\nI couldn\u2019t believe it! Here I was, a 31-year-old bachelor, living in New York City, and the reality of this evening was I was going home  \nwhile my mom was not. We were still on the phone, but I didn\u2019t know how to end it. Was I cool with this? Was I even happy for her?         \n\n\u201cMom,\u201d I heard myself say.         \n\n\u201cYeah, honey?\u201d         \n\n\u201cBe careful.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/06/booming/when-moms-clicks-lead-to-love-first.html", "date": "2013-10-03", "description": "Mother and son hit dating Web sites at the same time, with unpredictable, and somewhat surreal, results."}
