{"headline": "Jack Handey Is the Envy of Every Comedy Writer in America", "body": "\nWhen Jack Handey sold his first jokes to Steve Allen in 1977, Allen sent him a letter offering him $100 and telling him his name sounded like a product, not a person. \u201cSay homemakers, take a look at the new Jack Handey,\u201d Allen wrote. \u201cJust the thing for slicing, dicing, mopping, slopping, stamping, primping. . . . \u201d         \n\nThe longtime \u201cSimpsons\u201d writer Ian Maxtone-Graham, who worked with Handey at \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d recalled that everyone he told about Handey asked if that was a fake name. \u201cI wonder why that is,\u201d Maxtone-Graham said. \u201cI guess because it sounds like, if your car breaks down, you should have a Jack Handey.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI hope your article can clear up all the confusion,\u201d Senator Al Franken told me when I contacted him. \u201cJack Handey is a real person, and he wrote all the \u2018Deep Thoughts.\u2019 Not me.\u201d         \n\nJack Handey is a solidly built man of 64 with a swoop of graying hair; when he smiles, his teeth are blindingly white. We were sitting around the island in Handey\u2019s Santa Fe kitchen as his wife, Marta, made huevos rancheros for breakfast. Jack and Marta have been together for 36 years. I asked if he helped out around the kitchen, and he said, \u201cI can cook Cheerios.\u201d         \n\n\u201cYou can cook a hard-boiled egg!\u201d Marta said brightly.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting pretty good at that,\u201d he agreed.         \n\nHandey is best known as the writer and performer of \u201cDeep Thoughts,\u201d a series of quasi-philosophical cracked aphorisms that ran on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d from 1991 to 1998. The license plate on Handey\u2019s car is DPTHOTS; on the wall of the garage is mounted the plate he purchased initially but never used: DEEPTHT. That\u2019s because the day Handey was screwing it on, Marta\u2019s brother asked, \u201cWhy does your license plate say \u2018Deep Throat\u2019?\u201d         \n\nThe four \u201cDeep Thoughts\u201d books hogged bookstore checkout counters for much of the 1990s and sold, in total, about a million copies. Now he has written a novel, his first, titled \u201cThe Stench of Honolulu,\u201d available this month. The narrator is a narcissistic borderline sociopath, and the novel\u2019s fictional Honolulu is a smelly hellhole full of ooga-booga natives right out of a 1930s cartoon. Handey is familiar with the real Hawaii; he recounted a memorable trip the couple took to Kauai, in which a beautiful day of snorkeling ended at nightfall with hundreds of cockroaches emerging from every corner of their rental house and swarming over everything they owned. (Handey joked about being nervous that, once the book comes out, he won\u2019t ever be allowed to go back.) The novel also functions as a kind of thought exercise. The exercise is: What if the \u201cDeep Thoughts\u201d guy was a character in a book?         \n\nMaria Semple, a writer for \u201cS.N.L.\u201d and \u201cArrested Development\u201d and the author of the novel \u201cWhere\u2019d You Go, Bernadette,\u201d spent a long time on the phone with me trying to explain what it is about Handey\u2019s comedy that makes him different from almost anyone else writing comedy today. \u201cIn the rewrite room,\u201d she finally said, \u201cwe used to say, \u2018It smells like a joke.\u2019 That\u2019s the scourge of comedy these days. It smells like a joke, but there\u2019s no actual joke there. I\u2019m not the comedy police, but you watch a movie, and everyone\u2019s laughing, and then you shake it out and you realize, \u2018There\u2019s no joke there!\u2019 \u201d But in Handey\u2019s novel, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t think four lines go by without a killer joke. These are real jokes, man. They don\u2019t just smell like jokes.\u201d         \n\nThis idea \u2014 the notion of real jokes and the existence of pure comedy \u2014 came up again and again when I asked other writers about Handey. It seemed as if to them Handey is not just writing jokes but trying to achieve some kind of Platonic ideal of the joke form. \u201cThere is purity to his comedy,\u201d Semple said. \u201cHis references are all grandmas and Martians and cowboys. It\u2019s so completely free from topical references and pop culture that I feel like everyone who\u2019s gonna make a Honey Boo Boo joke should do some penance and read Jack Handey.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/magazine/jack-handey-is-the-envy-of-every-comedy-writer-in-america.html", "date": "2013-07-15", "description": "The man behind \u201cDeep Thoughts\u201d and the quest for the one true joke."}
