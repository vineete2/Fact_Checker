{"headline": "Jets\u2019 Up-and-Down Pattern Holds, and Crumples Them", "body": "\nCINCINNATI \u2014 It was not the  \n\u2019 first touchdown that epitomized their domination of  \n on Sunday. Or their second. Or their third. Or even their fourth, though all were worthy candidates.         \n\nNot the sixth or the seventh, either. No, it was the fifth. That was when Cincinnati safety Chris Crocker intercepted Geno Smith\u2019s first pass after halftime by sticking out his left hand, plucking the ball out of the air as if he were picking apples, and dashing into the end zone.         \n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t many games like this,\u201d Crocker said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get a complete victory when you just smother the team.\u201d         \n\nThe highlight for the Jets came when time expired in their 49-9 loss at Paul Brown Stadium. No longer were they forced to watch what devolved into a glorified practice for the Bengals, a performance that challenged the standard for ineptitude in  \n\u2019s four and a half seasons as the coach. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 11 signifying a debacle equivalent to the 45-3 fiasco at New England in 2010, Ryan characterized Sunday\u2019s defeat as a 10.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re only fortunate that it only counts for one loss,\u201d said Ryan, who watched his team fall behind by 14 points after the first quarter, 22 at halftime and 33 after three. He added, \u201cI don\u2019t know if there was one guy out there, on the sideline or on the field, that had a very good day.\u201d         \n\nNick Folk made all three of his field-goal attempts, but Ryan was not thinking about the Jets\u2019 kicking game.         \n\nNot after Andy Dalton shredded their defense for one of the best individual passing displays against Ryan, throwing for 325 yards and 5 touchdown passes \u2014 four to Marvin Jones \u2014 in three quarters. It seemed as if Dalton were competing against mannequins masquerading as cornerbacks, so thorough was his dismantling of the rookie Dee Milliner, who yielded four catches for 108 yards and a touchdown and was benched midway through the second quarter for the second time in five games.         \n\nAnd not after Smith threw two interceptions that were returned for touchdowns, his progress stunted by a Cincinnati defense that sacked him three times, hit him seven more and harassed him to such an extent that Matt Simms replaced him two minutes into the fourth quarter, after Adam Jones returned an interception 60 yards for a touchdown. In all, Smith has accounted for 16 turnovers this season.         \n\n\u201cNo one wants to lose the game, especially like this,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI think all the guys know what\u2019s at stake.\u201d         \n\nThat they do. They see a jumbled A.F.C. and a chance for a playoff berth. They also look around and see a team that is the ultimate tease, buoyant in victory and dumbfounded in defeat, unsure why losses have followed every win this season. Their inability to handle prosperity is an unflattering habit, a product of their seesawing rookie quarterback and an inexperienced roster. They demand \u2014 or at least welcome \u2014 recognition after toppling New England. And then they absorb a 40-point shellacking.         \n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s going to give us respect till we earn it,\u201d guard Willie Colon said. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re not earning it.\u201d         \n\nThe Jets reached the midway point of their season at a respectable 4-4. But they did so teetering and wobbling, mindful that with another defensive meltdown next week, Ryan said, New Orleans quarterback Drew Brees will \u201cbreak every record known to man.\u201d         \n\nTheir inconsistency produced divergent opinions in their locker room, with some players sharing the perspective of Ryan and Antonio Cromartie, who said, \u201cWe know we\u2019re a better group than what we showed.\u201d Muhammad Wilkerson, who addressed the team at halftime, described Sunday\u2019s loss as shocking, saying, \u201cI thought we was way better than this.\u201d Others still hinted at a lack of focus \u2014 at practice last week, and again early Sunday \u2014 that proved foreboding.         \n\n\u201cI felt like we were flat,\u201d receiver Jeremy Kerley said.         \n\nTwo ignominious patterns have emerged for Smith, patterns that intertwined Sunday: in their four games after victories, he has sputtered like an old car on a frosty morning, his struggles especially pronounced against teams with top-10 defenses.         \n\nSometimes, statistics can be misleading. The first quarter was not one of those times: Cincinnati outgained the Jets, 172 yards to 1, and the carnage, if possible, seemed far worse. Perhaps because of how Dalton dissected the Jets\u2019 secondary, sparing no one.         \n\nDalton completed passes to five receivers, throwing for two touchdowns \u2014 a 9-yard back-shoulder throw to Jones and a 4-yarder to Jermaine Gresham \u2014 in leading a scoring barrage unprecedented in Ryan\u2019s tenure as the Jets\u2019 coach. The Bengals (6-2) became the first opponent to score touchdowns on their opening two drives, and if not for a defensive stand at their 2 on the next drive, they would have been the first to score three.         \n\nEvery positive development for the Jets was followed by one that was twice as deflating. After converting Wilkerson\u2019s acrobatic interception into a field goal that cut their deficit to 14-3, the Jets responded by allowing an 86-yard scoring drive, with Darrin Walls \u2014 who had replaced Milliner two plays earlier \u2014 the culprit in coverage on another back-shoulder fade to Jones.         \n\nAfter drawing to 21-6 with 1 minute 8 seconds left in the first half, the Jets conceded a 71-yard kickoff return before a 14-yard touchdown to Jones with 16 seconds left. At the end of their worst 30 minutes of the season, the Jets staggered into halftime. Some players jogged toward the tunnel. Others chose to walk, as if dazed. Around the 20-yard line, Sheldon Richardson paused. He dropped to one knee and prayed. He stayed there, perhaps appealing for it to get better in the second half.         \n\nIt did not. Not at all.
