{"headline": "Storm Still Brews Over Scalding Coffee", "body": "\nEven 21 years later, it\u2019s clear that the case of Liebeck v. McDonald\u2019s hasn\u2019t lost its power to provoke. The Retro Report video about the lawsuit featured here this week has been watched more than a million times on several websites and attracted  \n, many vehement.         \n\nThe documentary, which I produced over months of reporting, showed that many misconceptions had arisen since a 79-year-old woman, Stella Liebeck, ordered coffee at a McDonald\u2019s drive-through, spilled the coffee, suffered severe burns, sued the company and was given a jury award of $2.9 million, later reduced to about $500,000.         \n\nNevertheless, a good many commenters remained committed to their erroneous understanding of the case, some castigating Ms. Liebeck as foolish for driving with liquid she must have known would be hot. This frustrated a host of other commenters, including M Craig from Kirkland, Wash., who reminded people: \u201cShe was in the passenger seat of a PARKED car when she was scalded. She was not one isolated case of scalding, there were hundreds \u2014 which, amazingly, did not move McDonald\u2019s to change their policy on the temperature at which to keep the coffee.\u201d         \n\nLaura of Brentwood wrote: \u201cShe got $500,000 \u2014 not the millions reported.\u201d         \n\nPatalcant from Southern California said, \u201cFrom what has been reported, the woman was not acting recklessly, given any kind of reasonable assumption she might have made about the actual risk of what she chose to do. Even if coffee is expected to be hot, who would expect that spilled coffee would result in third-degree burns on a significant portion of her body?\u201d         \n\nBeyond arguing over the facts of the case, commenters sparred over whether the lawsuit was warranted, tort reform, corporate responsibility, the American character (Scott in Rochester: \u201cUnfortunately, in America, we no longer have the ability to accept responsibility\u201d), even the proper brewing temperature for coffee.         \n\nMany who believed that Stella Liebeck was negligent remained unmoved. C from Atlanta wrote: \u201cShe ought to have gone inside to eat in the restaurant, where the coffee was less likely to have spilled and burned her. In other words, the people who don\u2019t like this verdict still don\u2019t like this verdict.\u201d         \n\nOther commenters focused on one of the elements that made this case a quintessential Retro Report, the way a story was initially amplified and distorted in the news media. Bill Milbrodt from Howell, N.J., wrote, \u201cif you are in the information-delivery business and want a message to have a specific twist brewed for a specific predilection, this is one hell of a story to learn from.\u201d         \n\nAnd Nina from New York approximated the Mark Twain quote when she wrote, \u201cA lie can go halfway around the world before the truth has got its boots on.\u201d         \n\nFor some of the principals in the case, the range and intensity of the reaction was not a complete surprise. Ms. Liebeck\u2019s lawyer, Ken Wagner, was gratified to see the media angle covered in such depth. \u201cThis story isn\u2019t about McDonald\u2019s or about Mrs. Liebeck per se, but about the media\u2019s failure to do its job in a measured way,\u201d he said. \u201cThe way the political winds were blowing, politicians seized on this and they don\u2019t do any fact checking. We\u2019ve all lost out in this because of the basic fact that the media didn\u2019t do its job.\u201d         \n\nJudy Allen had already endured seeing her mother, who died in 2004, belittled in news reports, comedy routines and even the Toby Keith song, \u201cAmerican Ride,\u201d with its lyric, \u201cSpill a cup of coffee, make a million dollars.\u201d She said this week that she felt a sense of relief to know that more people were getting to know the full story.         \n\n\u201cThe more exposure from the media as to what the correct story was, the better,\u201d Ms. Allen said about this report. She said that she got tired of having to correct people, but that there was one person she\u2019d look forward to confronting. \u201cI would like to spend five minutes with Toby Keith,\u201d she said, \u201cand ask him what he was thinking.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/28/booming/storm-still-brews-over-scalding-coffee.html", "date": "2013-10-25", "description": "Hundreds of wide-ranging and intense reactions followed the Retro Report video revisiting a 1992 case of Liebeck v.
