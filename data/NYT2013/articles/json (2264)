{"headline": "The Professor, the Bikini Model and the Suitcase Full of Trouble", "body": "\nIn November 2011, Paul Frampton, a theoretical particle physicist, met Denise Milani, a Czech bikini model, on the online dating site  \n. She was gorgeous \u2014 dark-haired and dark-eyed, with a supposedly natural DDD breast size. In some photos, she looked tauntingly steamy; in others, she offered a warm smile. Soon, Frampton and Milani were chatting online nearly every day. Frampton would return home from campus \u2014 he\u2019d been a professor in the physics and astronomy department at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for 30 years \u2014 and his computer would buzz. \u201cAre you there, honey?\u201d They\u2019d chat on Yahoo Messenger for a while, and then he\u2019d go into the other room to take care of something. A half-hour later, there was the familiar buzz. It was always Milani. \u201cWhat are you doing now?\u201d         \n\nFrampton had been very lonely since his divorce three years earlier; now it seemed those days were over. Milani told him she was longing to change her life. She was tired, she said, of being a \u201cglamour model,\u201d of posing in her bikini on the beach while men ogled her. She wanted to settle down, have children. But she worried what he thought of her. \u201cDo you think you could ever be proud of someone like me?\u201d Of course he could, he assured her.         \n\nFrampton tried to get Milani to talk on the phone, but she always demurred. When she finally agreed to meet him in person, she asked him to come to La Paz, Bolivia, where she was doing a photo shoot. On Jan. 7, 2012, Frampton set out for Bolivia via Toronto and Santiago, Chile. At 68, he dreamed of finding a wife to bear him children \u2014 and what a wife. He pictured introducing her to his colleagues. One thing worried him, though. She had told him that men hit on her all the time. How did that acclaim affect her? Did it go to her head? But he remembered how comforting it felt to be chatting with her, like having a companion in the next room. And he knew she loved him. She\u2019d said so many times.         \n\nFrampton didn\u2019t plan on a long trip. He needed to be back to teach. So he left his car at the airport. Soon, he hoped, he\u2019d be returning with Milani on his arm. The first thing that went wrong was that the e-ticket Milani sent Frampton for the Toronto-Santiago leg of his journey turned out to be invalid, leaving him stranded in the Toronto airport for a full day. Frampton finally arrived in La Paz four days after he set out. He hoped to meet Milani the next morning, but by then she had been called away to another photo shoot in Brussels. She promised to send him a ticket to join her there, so Frampton, who had checked into the Eva Palace Hotel, worked on a physics paper while he waited for it to arrive. He and Milani kept in regular contact. A ticket to Buenos Aires eventually came, with the promise that another ticket to Brussels was on the way. All Milani asked was that Frampton do her a favor: bring her a bag that she had left in La Paz.         \n\nWhile in Bolivia, Frampton corresponded with an old friend, John Dixon, a physicist and lawyer who lives in Ontario. When Frampton explained what he was up to, Dixon became alarmed. His warnings to Frampton were unequivocal, Dixon told me not long ago, still clearly upset: \u201cI said: \u2018Well, inside that suitcase sewn into the lining will be cocaine. You\u2019re in big trouble.\u2019 Paul said, \u2018I\u2019ll be careful, I\u2019ll make sure there isn\u2019t cocaine in there and if there is, I\u2019ll ask them to remove it.\u2019 I thought they were probably going to kidnap him and torture him to get his money. I didn\u2019t know he didn\u2019t have money. I said, \u2018Well, you\u2019re going to be killed, Paul, so whom should I contact when you disappear?\u2019 And he said, \u2018You can contact my brother and my former wife.\u2019 \u201d Frampton later told me that he shrugged off Dixon\u2019s warnings about drugs as melodramatic, adding that he rarely pays attention to the opinions of others.         \n\nOn the evening of Jan. 20, nine days after he arrived in Bolivia, a man Frampton describes as Hispanic but whom he didn\u2019t get a good look at handed him a bag out on the dark street in front of his hotel. Frampton was expecting to be given an Herm\u00e8s or a Louis Vuitton, but the bag was an utterly commonplace black cloth suitcase with wheels. Once he was back in his room, he opened it. It was empty. He wrote to Milani, asking why this particular suitcase was so important. She told him it had \u201csentimental value.\u201d The next morning, he filled it with his dirty laundry and headed to the airport.         \n\nFrampton flew from La Paz to Buenos Aires, crossing the border without incident. He says that he spent the next 40 hours in Ezeiza airport, without sleeping, mainly \u201cdoing physics\u201d and checking his e-mail regularly in hopes that an e-ticket to Brussels would arrive. But by the time the ticket materialized, Frampton had gotten a friend to send him a ticket to Raleigh. He had been gone for 15 days and was ready to go home. Because there was always the chance that Milani would come to North Carolina and want her bag, he checked two bags, his and hers, and went to the gate. Soon he heard his name called over the loudspeaker. He thought it must be for an upgrade to first class, but when he arrived at the airline counter, he was greeted by several policemen. Asked to identify his luggage \u2014 \u201cThat\u2019s my bag,\u201d he said, \u201cthe other one\u2019s not my bag, but I checked it in\u201d \u2014 he waited while the police tested the contents of a package found in the \u201cMilani\u201d suitcase. Within hours, he was under arrest.         \n\n \n Frampton this past fall in the prison warden\u2019s office in Devoto, one of the few remaining old-style jails in Buenos Aires, so dilapidated that its windows stick open and rain leaks through the roof. It was September, the beginning of spring in the Southern Hemisphere, but there was still a chill in the air, and the prison heating system was down as usual.         \n\n\u201cHey Professor, have you won the Nobel yet?\u201d a guard shouted as Frampton walked by. He was wearing a red Adidas tracksuit (\u201cAdidas seems to have a franchise in Devoto,\u201d he said), running shoes and a tattered Barbour coat to keep warm. \u201cThis is the coat the royal family wears, it\u2019s for hunting,\u201d Frampton, who grew up in Britain, pointed out. \u201cSee, it has this pocket in the back where you can put a dead bird.\u201d Frampton had been in Devoto for eight months, awaiting trial on charges of transporting two kilos of cocaine into the country. He was housed not in a single cell but in a group pavilion with 80 men accused of drug dealing or smuggling, most of them from other Latin American countries. Frampton had had almost no experience with drugs in his life, apart from the occasional drink and a nicotine addiction (he\u2019d given up smoking two years before). Now he was living with people who were not only well versed in the intricacies of the drug trade but regular users of marijuana and cocaine. The pavilion was often illuminated at night by little flames held under spoons, as inmates cooked  \n, a cocaine paste similar to crack that is often made with kerosene and sulfuric acid. But there were good things about not being in a private cell, too. A number of the prisoners on the pavilion had their own TVs. On Sunday mornings, Frampton would turn on the classical-music station, Arpeggio, so he could listen for a few hours before others got up and switched the channel back to music videos. Whenever his case was reported on local news channels, pictures of Denise Milani would flash across the TV screen, eliciting catcalls and applause from the other prisoners.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m a bit of a celebrity in here,\u201d Frampton said. From the moment of his arrest he had maintained that he was the victim of a scam \u2014 even if it didn\u2019t occur to him right away that the Milani with whom he was corresponding was not the real Milani \u2014 and he projected a sense that all that had happened to him was a mistake that would soon be resolved. Perfectly congenial, he kept punctuating my questions about his present predicament with \u201cAnd after this, we\u2019ll get to physics, right?\u201d         \n\nFinally, eyes burning with schoolboy enthusiasm, interrupted now and then by a spasmodic cough \u2014 he has a lung condition, which the smoke-filled prison air worsened \u2014 he talked me through what he called his \u201c14 groundbreaking discoveries,\u201d which he had written out for me on a piece of notepaper. Frampton closed our interview half-seriously, half-impishly, with another kind of calculation: \u201cI\u2019ve co-authored with three Nobel laureates. Only 11 theoretical physicists have done that. Six out of those 11 have won  \n themselves. Following this logic, I have a 55 percent chance of getting the Nobel.\u201d         \n\n \n holds an  \n and has been an adviser to the Department of Energy, ended up in Devoto appears at first to be a classic tale: a brilliant man of science gets into trouble as soon as he tries to navigate the real world. Since his arrest, he has certainly cultivated this notion, burnishing his wacky-scientist profile with lines like \u201cThat\u2019s my na\u00efvet\u00e9\u201d and \u201cMy mind works in a strange way.\u201d         \n\nThose who know him well also portray him as a kind of idiot savant, someone who could have been easily duped by whoever was posing as Milani. \u201cWomen came later in Paul\u2019s life,\u201d says Richard Czerniawski, a chemist who was a student with Frampton at Oxford University and now lives in Buenos Aires. Frampton was married for the first time at age 50, to Anne-Marie Frampton, then 52, a Frenchwoman living in the United States, who calls herself a physics groupie: \u201cI couldn\u2019t completely follow everything Paul said, because of the mathematics, of course, but either I could understand the words, or I could just listen to the music, the music of physics.\u201d The pair divorced in 2008 but are still on good terms. Anne-Marie describes her ex-husband as a very good scientist with the emotional age of a 3-year-old. \u201cI was flabbergasted, flabbergasted but not surprised,\u201d she said, referring to the call she received from Frampton from Devoto prison. \u201cPaul is a very experienced traveler, but that sentence, \u2018Don\u2019t take any luggage that doesn\u2019t belong to you,\u2019 he doesn\u2019t even hear that. He\u2019s in another world, an alternate universe.\u201d         \n\nOne story about his search for a new wife certainly bolstered this view. Shortly after his divorce, Frampton, then 64, expressed concern about finding a wife between the ages of 18 and 35, which Frampton understood to be the period when women are most fertile. One particularly promising candidate was a young Chinese woman. After an extended e-mail correspond\u00adence, Frampton arranged to see her during a trip to China to visit another eminent scientist, but they met for only an hour, and \u201cit didn\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d The next important contender appears to have been Milani. \u201cHe told me to look her up on the Internet,\u201d Dixon recalled. \u201cI thought he was out of his mind, and I told him that. \u2018You\u2019re not talking to the real girl. Why would a young woman like that be interested in an old guy like you?\u2019 But he really believed that he had a pretty young woman who wanted to marry him.\u201d When I later asked Frampton what made him think that Milani was interested, he replied, \u201cWell, I have been accused of having a huge ego.\u201d         \n\nOver the course of three and a half months, Frampton called my house 42 times from jail. He\u2019d call to report the latest news.  \n about the U.N.C. provost\u2019s \u201cillegal\u201d action \u2014 cutting off his salary without any due process \u2014 had succeeded in getting the provost fired. (The provost had granted Frampton 60 days of paid leave, then suspended his salary until he could resume his duties as a faculty member.  \n.) He was particularly pleased about the provost\u2019s dismissal, because the severance of his salary had had real repercussions. Apparently without savings, he was unable to afford a private lawyer and had to rely on an overburdened Argentine public defender. He\u2019d given up his health insurance and risked losing his car and apartment in Chapel Hill. In Argentina, he scrambled to get the money he needed to buy himself decent food in prison and telephone cards, of which he might have as many as 30 in his pocket.         \n\nIt turned out that the provost was stepping down voluntarily in June 2013 and would remain as a faculty member. Frampton didn\u2019t seem sheepish about having linked the provost\u2019s fate to his own. He was excited about something else now. The president of Harvard, he\u2019d heard, had been given a memo about his case in hopes that she\u2019d mention it to Argentina\u2019s president, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, during Kirchner\u2019s visit to the university. \u201cI think I\u2019ve never been discussed by two such important people in my life,\u201d Frampton reflected. (Harvard\u2019s president never received any memo about Frampton, and she and Kirchner never did discuss his case.) Or he\u2019d report, ever hopefully, that he\u2019d be out on house arrest any day. (His Argentine public attorney, Ignacio Anitua, had requested that his client be placed on house arrest, given his age and his pulmonary ailment, but the request was still wending its way through official channels.) He asked me to bring him Gruy\u00e8re, blue cheese, curry powder, chili pepper, notebooks, reading glasses and telephone cards, and he expressed frustration about the slow progress of his case. He was especially exasperated that the text messages on his confiscated cellphone from Jan. 20, the day of the bag exchange, had still not been handed over to his defense lawyer by the police, despite repeated requests. \u201cIt\u2019s clear from those messages that it was not my bag,\u201d he said. \u201cThat should be sufficient to exonerate me.\u201d (His public defender told me that the text messages were actually in his file but would never be enough to prove his innocence.)         \n\nOne Monday, Frampton called three times. The first time was at 3 p.m. He was animated and talked at length about the \u201cvolatile situation\u201d at the university, which had yet to reinstate his salary, despite letters of support from the Nobel laureate Sheldon Lee Glashow and from John C. Taylor, emeritus professor of physics at the University of Cambridge,  \n. \u201cResearch institutions throughout the country are in jeopardy if a tenured professor of 30 years has his salary suddenly revoked without any due process,\u201d Frampton said. \u201cThis means that the jobs of tens of thousands of tenured professors are at risk.\u201d         \n\nSecond call, 6 p.m.: Frampton reported that he was a month into his prison stay before his fellow prisoners managed to convince him that the woman he thought he\u2019d been in touch with all this time had probably been a man impersonating her. The real Denise Milani was never accused of having a role in the drug smuggling and has no connection to Frampton. \u201cThe only real connection we have is through the international media,\u201d Frampton admitted.  \n expressed alarm about having her name associated with drug smugglers, fear for herself, her 12-year-old son and \u201csympathy\u201d for the professor. \u201cI feel sympathy for her, too,\u201d Frampton said. (Despite repeated attempts, Milani could not be reached for comment.)         \n\nThird call, 8 p.m.: \u201cThere could be retribution. I could be assassinated.\u201d He spoke about how he had overheard the dealers and smugglers he was now living with talking about what happens to drug mules who lose the stash. He said people had told him someone must have been watching him move around at the airport, so they knew what he looked like. \u201cThese thoughts keep me up at night.\u201d         \n\n \n to seeing himself as the center of the action whatever the milieu. When he was growing up in Worcestershire, England, in what he describes as a \u201clower-middle-class family,\u201d his mother encouraged him to report his stellar grades to all the neighbors, a practice that may have led the young Frampton to confuse worldly laurels with love. At 18, he enrolled at Brasenose College, Oxford, obtaining his Ph.D. in 1968. He received a number of offers for postdocs, including one at Princeton and another at the University of Chicago. His advisers suggested he go to Chicago to work with the Japanese physicist Yoichiro Nambu. Nambu was an intellectual giant in the field, but Frampton\u2019s advisers may have had other reasons for steering Frampton his way. Nambu, who would go on to win the Nobel Prize in 2008, has, Frampton told me, \u201castonishingly no ego.\u201d         \n\nAs Frampton tells it, his life is one unbroken line of impressive grades, advanced degrees and innumerable citations of his work in cosmology and physics. There is certainly much truth to this. \u201cHe has always been very inventive in thinking of new ideas extending and going beyond the standard model of particle physics,\u201d says Prof. Edward Witten of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. But then there is Frampton\u2019s tendency to transfer his professional accomplishments to his personal life. In what a fellow physicist described as a \u201cvery vain, very inappropriate\u201d talk delivered on the 80th birthday of Murray Gell-Mann, a Nobel laureate in physics, Frampton veered into autobiography, recounting how his ability to multiply numbers in his head at 4 led him to see himself as \u201ccleverer than Newton.\u201d This line became a refrain throughout the talk. Interspersed with the calculations and hypotheses were his Oxford grades, which, he said, showed that he, like Newton, was in the top 1 percentile for intelligence. Frampton insists that he was merely joking and that his sense of humor was misinterpreted as self-regard. Yet in many of my conversations with him, he seemed to cling to the idea of his own exceptionalism. During our first meeting, when I asked him what attracted him to Milani, he said, \u201cNot to offend present company,\u201d referring to me and the representative from the penitentiary service, \u201cbut, to start with, she\u2019s in the top 1 percentile of how women look.\u201d And in an e-mail to Milani \u2014 or, rather, the fake Milani \u2014 Frampton wrote, \u201cAs these days tick by, and I think about it a lot, the more I realize that we are the perfect couple in all respects.\u201d         \n\nThe strategy of Frampton\u2019s defense team was to present Frampton as a brilliant man out of touch with day-to-day life. They called in a psychologist, who pronounced him unusually gullible without, however, diagnosing a mental illness. The judges sent their own doctor, who declared Frampton normal. A total of three psychological evaluations were presented at the trial, and two agreed that he had the traits of a narcissistic personality \u2014 an overblown and unrealistic image of himself. One concluded that it did not constitute a pathology, while the other suggested that there were pathological aspects to his narcissism that led to gaps in his understanding of reality.         \n\nFidel Schaposnik, a physics professor at the National University of La Plata, which, along with the University of Buenos Aires, had offered Frampton a visiting professorship to help get him released from Devoto while he awaited trial, said of Frampton: \u201cHe\u2019s a typical person trained at Oxford. He knows he\u2019s part of an elite and can\u2019t imagine such things would happen to him.\u201d Indeed, Frampton sees academia\u2019s denizens as creative misfits who deserve special protection. \u201cPeople who are socially inept can nevertheless be the most creative people,\u201d he told me one afternoon on the telephone. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that they can\u2019t be fired. This is the genius of tenure.\u201d         \n\n \n case similar to Frampton\u2019s in the past year, that of a New Zealander named  \n. Like Frampton, Armstrong, a former executive at the Maori Language Commission, said she met her lover on an Internet dating site and, after months of online contact, made a plan to meet him abroad, passing through Buenos Aires on her way to London to pick up some important paper contracts for him. She was caught carrying a bag with five kilos of cocaine. After the two were mentioned together in a number of articles, Armstrong contacted Frampton. The judges in her case \u2014 she received a sentence of 4 years 10 months \u2014 were also going to be the judges in his.         \n\nAccording to Rusty Payne, a spokesman for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, if Frampton and Armstrong were unaware of their involvement, they would be the exception. He had never heard of a case in which a virtual \u201choney trap\u201d had been used to dupe someone into being an unwitting drug mule. \u201cWhen it comes to drug trafficking, we rarely see someone duped or used as part of a ruse,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is very typical for those arrested to claim no knowledge or involvement.\u201d The prosecutor in Frampton\u2019s case, Mario Villar \u2014 80 percent of his cases involve drug smuggling \u2014 concurred. It is highly improbable, he said, that a person is unaware that he or she is carrying drugs. Frampton acknowledged that this was undoubtedly true \u2014 most of the time. Of the other 79 prisoners on his pavilion, he thought none were innocent. \u201cSome people will say they\u2019re innocent, but when I talk to them further, it becomes clear that they were somehow involved. I think people like me are less than 1 percent.\u201d         \n\nThree weeks before his trial, Frampton hired private lawyers. When I asked how he was able to afford them, he first said he\u2019d rather not tell me, then claimed that friends in Argentina were footing the bill. The new lawyers picked up where his public defenders left off, yet at a significantly accelerated pace. On Oct. 30, I spoke to Frampton as he was driving away from Devoto, accompanied by his friend, Czerniawski, who had agreed to take Frampton in on house arrest. Giddily, he said that the first thing he wanted to do was to sleep in, impossible in prison because every morning at 7:30 they do the roll call.         \n\nThe following day at midday, I met Frampton at the Czerniawskis\u2019 three-bedroom apartment, just blocks away from the Argentine Parliament. Dressed in a dark blue pinstriped suit and a tie covered with tiny red-beaked penguins, Frampton was finishing lunch with Czerniawski\u2019s wife, Silvia, and their two daughters. \u201cSee,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m Paul Frampton again.\u201d Czerniawski was at work. When I asked Frampton if he had slept in, he said he spent half the night on the Internet, reading through all the latest discoveries in his field, checking to see what his \u201ccompetitors\u201d had been working on, and beginning to answer the thousands of e-mails he received. He reported that he had more citations than ever. The conversation turned to his long-awaited release to house arrest. How had the new lawyers achieved so quickly what his public attorney had been requesting for more than four months? \u201cThey say they drink mat\u00e9 with the judges,\u201d Frampton answered cryptically. Later he added, \u201cA little bird told me that if I get off, I\u2019ll never know why.\u201d         \n\nHe showed me his latest calculations, pages of beautifully rendered symbols with not a word in sight except for \u201cNestor Kirchner,\u201d the former president and deceased husband of current president, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, written in the margin. \u201cI\u2019m trying to connect the God particle, the  \n, with dark energy \u2014 you know, the thing that makes the universe accelerate. This sounds a bit egomaniacal, but to understand dark energy, I think we have to be open-minded about Einstein\u2019s general relativity.\u201d         \n\nThis time, he was the one who brought the conversation back around to drug smuggling, showing palpable anxiety about the outcome of his trial. He told me uneasily that his lawyers had reported that nearly all drug-smuggling cases that came to trial ended in guilty verdicts.         \n\nAs I was leaving, he stepped out with me into the hallway. \u201cCan I do this?\u201d he asked, wondering if he was violating his house arrest. He got into the elevator, a wrought-iron cage that offered a view of the stairs as it descended, and repeated, \u201cCan I do this?\u201d He accompanied me down another long hall to the entrance and gave me a kiss on the cheek goodbye, peering out at the street as the door closed.         \n\n \non Nov. 12, Frampton\u2019s trial began in a small wood-paneled courtroom, where he sat before three judges. On exhibit in front of the judges was a collapsed black cloth suitcase with wheels wrapped in yellow cellophane.         \n\nFrampton\u2019s long-held defense \u2014 that he was duped because he had a childlike understanding of the ways of the world \u2014 began to unravel. The prosecutor opened his cross-examination of Frampton by citing a text message retrieved from Frampton\u2019s confiscated cellphone. \u201cOn Jan. 22 at 9:46 a.m.,\u201d he said, \u201cyou wrote from Ezeiza airport to the person you understood to be Denise Milani: \u2018Was worried only about sniffer dogs but more.\u2019 \u201d As his interrogation of Frampton continued, he read other text messages sent from Frampton\u2019s phone. One at 9:52 a.m.: \u201cNeed to know if your loyalty is with the bad guy-agent & bolivian friends \u2014 or good guy, your husband?\u201d And another at 9:56 a.m.: \u201cSIRU\u201d \u2014 the Hotel Siru, where they were planning to meet in Brussels \u2014 \u201cIS AMBUSH.\u201d 10:14 a.m.: \u201cYour naivety is bad for me, us. This is millions. NO SIRU, OK?\u201d At 11:19 a.m., Frampton sent Milani an e-mail: \u201cThis stuff is worth nothing in Bolivia, but $Ms in Europe. You meet me at the airport and we do not go near the hotel the \u2018agent\u2019 suggested. Stay at another hotel.\u201d At 11:47 a.m., there was another text message: \u201cMonday arrival changed. You must not tell the coca-goons.\u201d At 12:16 p.m., he wrote: \u201cWHY ARE YOU IGNORING ME? AT THIS LAST MOMENT. WE DID NOT DECIDE HOW TO MEET TOMORROW IN BRUSSELS AND KEEP COCA & LIVES. AT SIRU WE MAY LOSE BOTH!!\u201d At 1:06: \u201cWe may do cool 1,000,000.\u201d         \n\nFrampton explained to the judges that these messages were jokes. He\u2019d made them up because of Dixon\u2019s earlier warnings about drugs. \u201cI was trying to keep Denise amused. I had already decided to fly back to North Carolina.\u201d But even taking Frampton\u2019s peculiar brand of humor into account, it was hard to understand why he would have taken the joke so far. He sent 30 messages like this, with specific details that made it seem as if he were referring to a real situation, a considered plan, not fabricating a story on the spot. Or did he think that whoever was behind the man who came to the hotel with the suitcase might hurt Milani if he didn\u2019t agree to take the bag? While for much of his life Frampton seems to have had little interest in money, he may well have seen his actions as a strategy to prove to Milani once and for all that he was indeed the husband of her dreams \u2014 a knight slaying dragons.         \n\nThe defense worked to show that far from hatching some elaborate plot, Frampton was unconcerned about the contents of the bag. Footage from airport security cameras showed him getting up from a cafe table and wandering off, leaving his open laptop and his two bags \u2014 his own white one and Milani\u2019s black one \u2014 unattended for up to 25 minutes at a time, gazing in shop windows, talking to security personnel, standing at an airline counter, returning to his abandoned luggage and then, an hour or so later, repeating the operation. Would anyone, even a wacky scientist, behave this way if he knew he was transporting two kilos of cocaine?         \n\nAnd if Frampton\u2019s behavior was innocent, it still called for an explanation. Who leaves his bags unattended in an airport? Frampton, apparently. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him in airports,\u201d his ex-wife said, \u201cHe leaves all his bags and goes for half an hour somewhere else.\u201d         \n\nThe prosecution continued to press its case, producing a piece of paper on which Frampton had written:         \n\n\u201c1 gram 200 dollars         \n\n2,000 grams 400,000 dollars.\u201d         \n\nThe amount of cocaine found in the bag Frampton was carrying was 1,980 grams. When asked why he\u2019d been making this calculation, Frampton said: \u201cMy mind works in a strange way.\u201d That evening, Frampton told me on the telephone, \u201cI made those calculations in the airport office after having been arrested,\u201d a fact that his defense team stressed the following day, noting Frampton\u2019s tendency to make random calculations. They asked him to explain another notation on the same piece of paper that read \u201c5 standard deviations 99.99994%.\u201d \u201cThe criterion for the discovery of the Higgs boson had to be 5 standard deviations, which means it\u2019s extremely unlikely to be a statistical fluctuation,\u201d Frampton explained. He was \u201ccalculating the probability that Denise Milani would become my second wife, which was almost a certainty.\u201d Pursuing this line of questioning, his lawyer asked whether Frampton was also calculating the weight of one of the judges.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m embarrassed to admit it, but yes,\u201d Frampton answered. \u201cI calculated that he must weigh 100 kilos.\u201d         \n\n\u201cYou calculated badly, as badly as you did about your second marriage,\u201d the judge responded. \u201cI\u2019m 124 kilos.\u201d         \n\nOn the third and last day of the trial, the defense exhibited love letters Frampton had written to Denise Milani that they recovered from his Gmail account. They were full of tenderness, vividly imagining their life together in Chapel Hill. She wouldn\u2019t need to work at first; she could accompany him to the office, make friends at the gym, the cafeteria and the supermarket; they\u2019d take walks on the beach, and soon their little baby would arrive. Eventually she could get a contract with Victoria\u2019s Secret. A response from Milani exhibited matching tenderness: \u201cYou\u2019re the best thing that\u2019s happened in my cursed life.\u201d But the judges were apparently unmoved by these declarations of love. As Frampton\u2019s former defense lawyer said, \u201cThe only thing that matters as far as the law is concerned is whether Frampton knew there were drugs in the bag. Whether he did it for money or a woman doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d         \n\nOn Nov. 19, Frampton was sentenced to 4 years 8 months for drug smuggling.         \n\nAfter the trial, Frampton said his lawyers had forbidden him to speak to me, fearing that he might say something \u201cstupid.\u201d But three weeks later, this injunction was lifted, and I went to visit him again at the Czerniawskis\u2019, where he remains under house arrest. With credit for the time he has already spent in custody, Frampton is expected to be released in May 2014. (Under Argentine law, a foreigner must serve half his sentence but can then be expelled from the country, and the penalty is then considered discharged.) It was a hot summer day, and he was dressed casually this time, in a light blue polo shirt, white shorts, black socks and black sneakers. He was still insisting on his innocence, but a new wariness had crept into his manner. He asked me several questions about myself, as if trying to gauge with each word which version of Paul Frampton I believed. He reported that U.N.C. would not make any decisions about his position on the faculty until it heard the results of his appeal, which could be months away. (U.N.C. confirmed that Frampton still has his position but that his current salary is $0.) His lawyers were using the same strategy they had previously, but introducing further evidence, like the complete record of his Yahoo Messenger chats with Milani, which he felt sure would exonerate him. \u201cIt shows unambiguously,\u201d he said later, \u201cthat the only reason I went to South America was to meet Denise Milani.\u201d For his part, Frampton had been working on two papers simultaneously. \u201cSo I can rest assured that I\u2019m not like Oscar Wilde,\u201d he said. While in Devoto, he checked out a copy of Oscar Wilde\u2019s \u201cPicture of Dorian Gray,\u201d destined for English-language learners, from the prison library. He read in the preface that after Wilde\u2019s stay in prison, he gave up writing. \u201cThat really affected me. He lost his confidence.\u201d         \n\nThe night before, Frampton told me, he watched the Nobel Prize ceremony live in Stockholm. He described to me how the king of Sweden presented the prizes in a concert hall, adding that he had been there once himself. His greatest dream was \u201cto have a prediction verified by experimentation.\u201d This, he explained, was how you win the Nobel as a theoretical particle physicist. \u201cThat would bring an enormous sense of fulfillment, quite apart from the Nobel Prize,\u201d he said. \u201c \u2018I predicted a particle that\u2019s actually in the universe.\u2019 Wouldn\u2019t that be a rush? Much better than other ways of getting a lot of dopamine.\u201d Later in the conversation, he reflected: \u201cI\u2019ve written 450 papers, an absurd number. A typical professor writes 100 in his career. I don\u2019t regret my work in physics, but I have made sacrifices.\u201d When asked what kind of sacrifices, he responded as if the answer were obvious, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t have a family.\u201d         \n\nOne of Frampton\u2019s last e-mails to Denise Milani was written on a pirated cellphone a month into his stay inside Devoto prison: \u201cI only think of cuddling all day and having sex all night with Denise Milani. How can you prove that you are Denise Milani?\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/10/magazine/the-professor-the-bikini-model-and-the-suitcase-full-of-trouble.html", "date": "2013-03-08", "description": "A world-renowned physicist meets a gorgeous model online.
