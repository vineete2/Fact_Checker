{"headline": "G.O.P. Is Resisting\nObama Pressure on\nTax Increase", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 House Republicans, shrugging off rising pressure from  \n, are resolutely opposing new tax increases to head off $85 billion in across-the-board spending reductions, all but ensuring the cuts will go into force March 1 and probably remain in place for months, if not longer.         \n\nDespite new calls from the White House on Wednesday to enact a combination of tax increases and cuts to postpone the so-called sequester, the House is moving forward on a legislative agenda that assumes deep and arbitrary cuts to defense and domestic programs \u2014 once considered unthinkable \u2014 will remain in place through the end of the year.         \n\nCongressional Republicans have relented in the most recent fiscal showdowns with the White House. But lawmakers say they have no intention of surrendering in this one even though  \n in government services and even military operations in the weeks ahead. The president\u2019s January fiscal victory, which yielded increases in income, capital gains and dividend tax rates on affluent families, has only bolstered Republican resolve.         \n\n\u201cThe president says he has to have tax increases to head off the sequester. Well, he already got his tax increase,\u201d Representative Martha Roby, Republican of Alabama, said in an interview Wednesday after visiting the town just outside of the Army\u2019s Fort Rucker, which stands to take a deep hit this spring. \u201cIt\u2019s unconscionable to use our military men and women in uniform as a bargaining chip to raise our taxes.\u201d         \n\nHouse Republicans say they believe they have politically inoculated themselves against claims they are responsible for the cuts by approving measures last year that would have substituted reductions in government programs like food stamps for the lower Pentagon spending. Party strategists have advised Republican members to aggressively blame the president for the creation of the automatic cuts and the failure to stop them.         \n\nTaking steps to avoid a full government shutdown at the end of March, the House Appropriations Committee as soon as next week will introduce legislation to keep the government financed through Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year, but do nothing to stop the pending cuts.         \n\nThe current stopgap  \n, and Republican leaders are eager to avoid an Easter-week shuttering of the government. In recent days, Mr. Obama has sought to force Republicans into negotiations: a Saturday radio address criticizing \u201cthe current Republican plan\u201d that \u201cputs the burden of avoiding those cuts mainly on seniors and middle-class families\u201d; a news conference on Tuesday with uniformed first responders whose jobs might be threatened; and on Wednesday, local television interviews broadcast in eight media markets, from Hawaii to South Carolina, urging Republicans to accept his \u201cbalanced approach\u201d to unwind the cuts or accept responsibility for their consequences.         \n\nBut House Republicans say they are feeling invulnerable in the current clash. Not only can they point to last year\u2019s bills to replace the cuts, but redistricting has made most of them immune to political threats and entreaties. For many representing conservative districts where the president holds little sway, an attack by Mr. Obama is a badge of honor, senior Republican House aides say.         \n\nIn the last showdowns won by the president, inaction was seen as intolerable. Had Republicans done nothing in 2011, a temporary  \n would have lapsed without offsetting tax cuts to ease the blow. On Jan. 1, every tax cut of the Bush administration would have expired at once had the Republicans not relented and let some taxes rise. This time, Republicans need not do anything and deep spending cuts they have demanded for years will go into force automatically.         \n\nSpeaker John A. Boehner wrote in an  \n on Wednesday: \u201cAs the president\u2019s outrage about the sequester grows in coming days, Republicans have a simple response: Mr. President, we agree that your sequester is bad policy. What spending are you willing to cut to replace it?\u201d         \n\nAnd the speaker sought to turn the blame back on the president after Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta on Wednesday fired off a letter, warning that he will have to furlough a large number of Pentagon civilian staff members, \u201cforgo critical objectives\u201d and \u201cdo real harm to our national security\u201d because of the cuts.
