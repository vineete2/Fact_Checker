But few people complain these days when they visit that New Deal-era building.         \n\nThey are glad to get their mail, send off a package and maybe chat a bit while they still can. In December, the government said it planned to sell it.         \n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to this beautiful, Depression-era architectural jewel,\u201d said Sara Meric, 87, a retired script analyst who has used this post office since 1959. \u201cIf, God forbid, this slaughter does go through, some entity should make sure that this building is protected.\u201d         \n\nThe Santa Monica post office, with its distinctive PWA Moderne style, is one of about 200 post offices around the country, dozens of them architecturally distinctive buildings, that the Postal Service has indicated it may choose to sell in coming years because of its financial problems.         \n\nEleven historic post offices are already on the market in places like Yankton, S.D.; Gulfport, Miss.; Norwich, Conn.; and Washington.         \n\nIn many cases the buildings have not only been community hubs, but also remain among the most architecturally distinguished buildings in their towns, legacies of New Deal efforts  \nto put America back to work.         \n\nSo as the Postal Service tries to shrink, it is often finding itself in battle with groups trying to prevent what the National Trust for Historic Preservation last year labeled one of the most significant threats to the country\u2019s architectural heritage.         \n\n\u201cUnless the U.S. Postal Service establishes a clear, consistent process that follows federal preservation law when considering disposal of these buildings, a significant part of the nation\u2019s architectural heritage will be at risk,\u201d the trust  \n that placed historic post offices on its most endangered list.         \n\nWhen these post offices close, preservationists say, important public buildings become private preserves as they are refurbished into commercial spaces like high-end retail stores. Though many of the buildings\u2019 exteriors are protected by local landmark laws, many of the interiors are not and developers tend to make changes like renovating lobbies.         \n\nIn one case, a post office built in 1937 without protected status was demolished. That building, in Virginia Beach, was knocked down in 2009 to make room for a Walgreens, despite attempts to save it.         \n\n\u201cThere are lots of quite significant post office buildings that are threatened because the Postal Service itself is threatened,\u201d said G. Martin Moeller Jr., a senior curator at the National Building Museum in Washington.         \n\nThe Postal Service  \n last year, and last month announced it was considering eliminating Saturday letter service. It says that the real estate sales raise revenue and save on operating costs, and that the shuttered post offices are those where the number of customers had declined, or where it found a less-expensive alternate site.         \n\n\u201cThe trend has been to maintain the post offices that are operational while saving money at the same time,\u201d said Sue Brennan, a spokeswoman for the service. \u201cThe Postal Service follows all applicable laws regarding the disposal of historic buildings.\u201d         \n\nThere are some 31,000 retail postal offices in the country, most of them leased. But roughly a quarter are government-owned and as many as 1,100 were built in the 1930s, when the government hired architects to design civic buildings.         \n\nIn 2011, the Postal Service identified about 3,700 post offices \u2014 some leased, some owned, some historic and some not \u2014 that it said may have to close in coming years to save money. When that plan met with opposition, the service announced it would instead try to lower expenses by reducing operating hours.         \n\nBut even as postal officials agreed not to eliminate outlets in some towns and cities, they did leave open the option to sell valuable properties and relocate services. \u201cPeriodic sales of post offices will be ongoing,\u201d Ms. Brennan said.         \n\nThe agency acknowledges that in recent years the sale of post office buildings has accelerated, and in 2011 it hired CBRE, a commercial real estate services firm, to handle the transactions.         \n\n\u201cOur biggest concern is the way they\u2019re going about it isn\u2019t transparent,\u201d said Chris Morris, a senior field officer for the National Trust and project manager for post office buildings. \u201cA lot of us are very confused about the process.\u201d         \n\nAdvocates say there have been too few public discussions or assurances that prized buildings will be protected.
