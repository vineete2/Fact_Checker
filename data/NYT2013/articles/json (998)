{"headline": "U.S. Agencies Dance Around Cellphone Use Aloft", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Transportation Department said on Thursday that it would consider banning the use of cellphones for voice calls aboard airplanes, a reaction to public outrage at a Federal Communications Commission proposal to lift a rule that has long forbidden the use of mobile phones during flight.         \n\nStill, consumers are likely to soon be able to text, check email and connect to the Internet on their cellphones while their flight is above 10,000 feet.         \n\nThe F.C.C. voted 3 to 2 to go ahead with its own measure to solicit comment on whether to repeal the rule on connected devices. But all five commissioners said they shared the public\u2019s doubts about such a change.         \n\nAfter nearly three weeks of public complaints for even raising the possibility of passengers\u2019 having to sit for hours while seatmates chatter on cellphones, the F.C.C. chairman and the transportation secretary agreed this week that there was a way to both promote technology and protect the public interest.         \n\n\u201cOver the past few weeks, we have heard of concerns raised by airlines, travelers, flight attendants, members of Congress and others who are all troubled over the idea of passengers\u2019 talking on cellphones in flight \u2014 and I am concerned about this possibility as well,\u201d the transportation secretary, Anthony Foxx, said.         \n\nThe department will consider whether allowing in-flight voice calls \u201cis fair to consumers,\u201d he said, in part by soliciting public comment.         \n\nA Quinnipiac University poll conducted last week found that roughly 59 percent of Americans said using a cellphone to make a call should not be allowed during flights, while just 30 percent said that it should.         \n\nAn Associated Press-GfK poll, also conducted last week,  \n did not want to allow cellphone conversations on flights, while 19 percent were in favor of it. About 30 percent had no opinion.         \n\nThe F.C.C.'s consideration, which focuses on all mobile devices, is different from the Transportation Department\u2019s more narrow interest in voice calls. \u201cThis is not a rule about usage,\u201d the F.C.C.'s chairman, Tom Wheeler, said. He added: \u201cThis is a rule about technology,\u201d specifically new technology that allows cellphones to be used on airborne planes without interfering with wireless networks on the ground.         \n\n\u201cLet me make clear what\u2019s going on here \u2014 nothing will be different on your flight tomorrow,\u201d Mr. Wheeler said. He added, \u201cI don\u2019t want to listen to the personal conversations and the business deals of person sitting next to me on a flight.\u201d         \n\nMr. Wheeler and the F.C.C. were surprised last month by the flood of phone calls and emails expressing anger at the possibility that cellphone conversations would be allowed on flights.         \n\nRepealing the existing regulation is necessary, Mr. Wheeler said, given the commission\u2019s responsibilities. \u201cIf technology eliminates interference and therefore it eliminates the need for an interference protection rule, then we ought to eliminate the rule,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe commission\u2019s two Republican members voted against seeking public comment on the proposed change. One of them, Ajit Pai, said removing the rule would not be in the public interest because it would allow airlines to infringe on the rights of wireless companies, which have exclusive licenses to use the airwaves at given frequencies.         \n\nCommissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, concurred with the other two Democrats on the panel to go ahead and ask the public about the cellphone proposal. But she made clear that she was unlikely to support a rule allowing in-flight voice calls.         \n\n\u201cIf we move beyond what we do here today and actually update our rules to allow calls on planes, we could see a future where our quiet time is monetized and seating in the silent section comes at a premium,\u201d Ms. Rosenworcel said.         \n\n\u201cBut worse, given the anger this proposal has generated and the negative response of so many of those who work on planes, I fear that our safety would be compromised,\u201d she added.         \n\nMr. Wheeler has regularly said that it would be up to individual airlines whether to permit voice calls. Several airlines in Asia, Europe and Australia allow the practice, but with rules about where the devices can be used and for how long.         \n\nIn a second cellphone-related measure, the F.C.C. and the wireless telephone industry announced terms that would allow consumers to unlock a cellphone bought from one carrier so that it may work on another\u2019s networks.         \n\nThe rules will apply to devices bought from a cellphone company under a mandatory subscription plan, once the contract is fulfilled, and to prepaid cellphones no longer than a year from purchase.         \n\nLocked mobile devices contain software that prevents cellphones or tablets from being used on compatible mobile networks, and can make it harder for consumers to keep the same mobile phone when changing carriers.         \n\n\u201cConsumers win when they are armed with the right information and know their options, especially when it comes to navigating how to unlock a wireless phone after completing a contract,\u201d Mr. Wheeler said in a statement.         \n\nThe wireless industry has opposed the measure until recently. Its industry group warned consumers not to confuse what the measure would and would not let them to do.         \n\n\u201cDevices that work on one provider\u2019s network may not be technologically compatible with another wireless provider\u2019s network,\u201d said Steve Largent, president and chief executive of CTIA-The Wireless Association.         \n\nFor example, an unlocked device may support voice services but not data when activated on a different network.
