{"headline": "G.O.P. Opposition to Immigration Law Is Falling Away", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Republican opposition to legalizing the status of millions of illegal immigrants is crumbling in the nation\u2019s capital as leading lawmakers in the party scramble to halt eroding support among Hispanic voters \u2014 a shift that is providing strong momentum for an overhaul of immigration laws.         \n\nSenator Rand Paul of Kentucky, a Tea Party Republican, on Tuesday became the latest to embrace a more welcoming approach, declaring to the nation\u2019s 11 million illegal immigrants that if they want to work in America, \u201cthen we will find a place for you.\u201d         \n\nWhile he never uttered the word \u201ccitizenship\u201d and said a secure border must come first, Mr. Paul strongly implied that citizenship would eventually be available to them.         \n\nRepublican sentiment for a more liberal immigration policy has been building in the aftermath of last year\u2019s election. But Mr. Paul\u2019s comments provided strong new evidence that the rising generation of conservative leaders is turning against the Republican argument that those who enter the country illegally should be denied the chance to become permanent residents.         \n\n\u201cPrudence, compassion and thrift all point us toward the same goal: bringing these workers out of the shadows and into becoming and being taxpaying members of society,\u201d Mr. Paul said in a speech before the  \n.         \n\nThe remarks are a departure for Mr. Paul, who as a Senate candidate in 2010 called for an electronic fence and helicopter stations to help secure the border with Mexico. His new message follows the publication on Monday of a blistering report from the Republican National Committee that urged the party\u2019s members to champion an immigration overhaul that Hispanics can embrace or risk seeing the party shrinking \u201cto its core constituencies only.\u201d         \n\nThe report left vague, however, just what that \u201ccomprehensive\u201d overhaul would include.         \n\nMr. Paul joins Senator Marco Rubio of Florida in a growing list of leading conservatives to urge a new approach on immigration. Mr. Rubio is part of a bipartisan group of eight senators who are working to create an immigration overhaul that can earn support from both parties.         \n\nSome Republicans, including Mr. Paul, remain wary of any plan that would move illegal immigrants ahead of those who are in the country legally when it comes to getting full citizenship.         \n\nThat view is particularly strong in the House, where Speaker John A. Boehner on Tuesday dodged the question of whether a separate, bipartisan group in his chamber working on immigration legislation would back a path to citizenship. But the House plan is expected to include some way for illegal immigrants to gain legal status.         \n\nSenator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, released a letter on Tuesday urging the Senate Judiciary Committee to move slowly, explaining to a group of reporters that there is no \u201cmoral or legal responsibility to reward somebody who entered the country illegally.\u201d         \n\nBut the new political landscape in Washington contrasts sharply with just a few years ago, when most Republicans derided the idea of legalized status for illegal immigrants as a form of amnesty that would simply encourage more people to cross the border illegally.         \n\nThe overall shift in sentiment means that four months after Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, made \u201cself-deportation\u201d the party\u2019s official position on immigration \u2014 and lost decisively to President Obama, especially among Hispanic voters \u2014 top party strategists and lawmakers of all ideological stripes are racing to change course.         \n\n\u201cNow, you have the standard-bearer of the Tea Party saying that we should welcome undocumented immigrants as Americans,\u201d said Frank Sharry, executive director of  \n, a pro-immigration group. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the fastest turnarounds I\u2019ve seen on any issue. It\u2019s mind-blowing.\u201d         \n\nBob Dane, a spokesman for the  \n, which opposes a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, conceded Tuesday that \u201cit certainly appears to be settled if one assumes that the inside Republican elite strategists represent the core of the  \n.\u201d         \n\nBut it remains to be seen how Republican voters and conservative activists across the country will respond to proposals that allow illegal immigrants to live in America and compete legally for jobs. Mr. Dane\u2019s group is meeting with 52 talk radio hosts in Washington next month for a two-day session intended to bolster opposition to the idea.         \n\n\u201cAmnesty is that which rewards lawbreaking,\u201d Mr. Dane said. \u201cAn amnesty bill is going to split the party. Workers are going to go crazy.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/20/us/politics/gop-opposition-to-immigration-law-is-falling-away.html", "date": "2013-03-19", "description": "A scramble by leading Republican lawmakers to halt a loss of support among Hispanic voters is providing strong momentum for an immigration overhaul."}
