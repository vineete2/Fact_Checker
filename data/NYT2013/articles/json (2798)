Snowden intensified on Wednesday, with one of the United States\u2019 closest allies, Germany, announcing that its leader had angrily called President Obama seeking reassurance that her cellphone was not the target of an American intelligence tap.         \n\nWashington hastily pledged that the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, leader of Europe\u2019s most powerful economy, was not the target of current surveillance and would not be in the future, while conspicuously saying nothing about the past. After a similar furor with France, the call was the second time in 48 hours that the president found himself on the phone with a close European ally to argue that the unceasing revelations of invasive American intelligence gathering should not undermine decades of hard-won trans-Atlantic trust.         \n\nBoth episodes illustrated the diplomatic challenge to the United States posed by the cache of documents that Mr. Snowden handed to the journalist Glenn Greenwald. Last week, Mr. Greenwald concluded a deal with the eBay founder Pierre Omidyar to build a new media platform that aims in part to publicize other revelations from the data Mr. Greenwald now possesses.         \n\nThe damage to core American relationships continues to mount. Last month, President  \n to the United States after Brazilian news media reports \u2014 fed by material from Mr. Greenwald \u2014 that the N.S.A. had intercepted messages from Ms. Rousseff, her aides and the state oil company, Petrobras. Recently, the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, which has said it has a stack of Snowden documents, suggested that United States intelligence had gained access to communications to and from President Felipe Calder\u00f3n of Mexico when he was still in office.         \n\nSecretary of State John Kerry had barely landed in France on Monday when the newspaper Le Monde disclosed what it said was the  \n, as well as spying on French diplomats. Furious, the French summoned the United States ambassador, Charles H. Rivkin, and President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande expressed \u201cextreme reprobation\u201d for the reported collection of 70 million digital communications from Dec. 10, 2012, to Jan. 8, 2013.         \n\nIn a  \n published online, James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, disputed some aspects of Le Monde\u2019s reporting, calling it misleading and inaccurate in unspecified ways.         \n\nHe did not address another report by Le Monde that monitoring by the United States had extended to \u201cFrench diplomatic interests\u201d at the United Nations and in Washington. Information garnered by the N.S.A. played a significant part in a United Nations vote on June 9, 2010, in favor of sanctions against Iran, Le Monde said.         \n\nTwo senior administration officials \u2014 from the State Department and the National Security Council \u2014 had arrived in Berlin only hours before the German government disclosed on Wednesday that it had received unspecified information that Ms. Merkel\u2019s cellphone was under surveillance.         \n\nIf confirmed, that is \u201ccompletely unacceptable,\u201d said her spokesman, Steffen Seibert. The accusations followed Der Spiegel\u2019s disclosures in June of widespread American surveillance of German communications, which struck an especially unsettling chord in a country scarred by the surveillance undertaken by Nazi and Communist governments in its past.         \n\nMr. Seibert quoted the chancellor, who was raised in Communist East Germany, as telling Mr. Obama that \u201cbetween close friends and partners, which the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States of America have been for decades, there should be no such surveillance of the communications of a head of government.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThat would be a grave breach of trust,\u201d Mr. Seibert quoted her as saying. \u201cSuch practices must cease immediately.\u201d         \n\nThe government statement did not disclose the source or nature of its suspicions. But Der Spiegel said on its Web site that Ms. Merkel acted after it submitted a reporting inquiry to the government. \u201cApparently, after an examination by the Federal Intelligence Service and the Federal Office for Security in Information Technology, the government found sufficient plausible grounds to confront the U.S. government,\u201d Der Spiegel wrote.         \n\nARD, Germany\u2019s premier state television channel, said without naming its sources that the supposed monitoring had targeted Ms. Merkel\u2019s official cellphone, not her private one.
