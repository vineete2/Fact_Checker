{"headline": "A Gamble in Iran Talks: Easing of the Sanctions", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In its delicate negotiations with Iran over freezing its nuclear program, the Obama administration is gambling that the gradual relaxation of punishing sanctions will whet Tehran\u2019s appetite for greater economic relief, inducing the country\u2019s leaders to negotiate a further deal to roll back its nuclear progress.         \n\nYet, President Obama\u2019s biggest critics \u2014 in Congress, the Arab world and Israel \u2014 argue that he has the strategy entirely backward. By changing the psychology around the world, they argue, the roughly $100 billion in remaining sanctions will gradually be whittled away. Wily middlemen, Chinese eager for energy sources and Europeans looking for a way back to the old days, when Iran was a major source of trade, will see their chance to leap the barriers.         \n\nSecretary of State John Kerry arrived in Geneva Saturday for his second visit in two weeks, again heightening expectations that negotiators are close to agreement on a pact to suspend Iran\u2019s nuclear program for six months. But Mr. Kerry cautioned that his presence and that of the five other foreign ministers whose countries are negotiating with Iran might not be enough to guarantee that a deal could be reached.         \n\nNevertheless, with a deal seemingly in reach, the focus is now shifting to the details, and particularly what sanctions would be reversed, in return for the freezing or dilution of Iran\u2019s uranium stockpile.         \n\nTo some critics, almost any relief is too much.         \n\n\u201cWe know who we\u2019re dealing with, and you know, we\u2019ve watched this same type of activity occur in North Korea where you begin to alleviate sanctions,\u201d said Senator Bob Corker, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, invoking the example that many cite of a sanctions relaxation, begun in the Bush administration, that backfired.         \n\n\u201cThe concern is that whatever you do on an interim basis becomes the new norm,\u201d Mr. Corker told reporters as he left the White House the other day, unconvinced by Mr. Obama\u2019s counterarguments.         \n\nThe Senate narrowly avoided this week  \n against Iran that the White House feared would blow up its chances of getting a preliminary agreement in Geneva this weekend, but Senator Harry Reid, one of President Obama\u2019s greatest allies, has made it clear a vote may well come soon after the Thanksgiving break.         \n\nAt the heart of the dispute is a fundamental disagreement about how best to negotiate with a savvy, skilled adversary, one whose own decision-making processes have long baffled American intelligence agencies.         \n\nMr. Obama and his aides have argued that unless they give President Hassan Rouhani and his Western-educated chief negotiator, Mohammad Javad Zarif, something to take home and advertise as a victory from the first round of negotiations, there is little chance they will return to negotiate a second, permanent deal.         \n\n\u201cZarif says he has at most six months to get a deal before the hard-liners rise again,\u201d one of the Obama administration\u2019s strategists said recently. \u201cAnd we believe him.\u201d         \n\nThe belief that Mr. Zarif\u2019s warning was real set off a lengthy debate among the United States and its fellow major powers \u2014 Britain, Germany, France, China and Russia \u2014 about how to give Iran a taste of relief without giving up too much. They settled on unfreezing a portion of the long-frozen assets that Iran has hungered to tap \u2014 roughly $3.6 billion in oil revenue parked in foreign banks. A senior administration official said the money would be doled out in still-to-be-determined increments over the six months of the agreement.         \n\nThe other calculation is that if Tehran is allowed to sell some petrochemicals, its second-largest export at roughly $11 billion last year, and to build autos from kits brought into the country, the Iranian economy will begin to create new jobs. The idea is to create a constituency for a bigger deal \u2014 one in which rolling back nuclear facilities, dismantling centrifuges and allowing inspectors far greater access to suspect sites would be traded for a far greater lifting of sanctions.
