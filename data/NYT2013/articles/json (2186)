{"headline": "Selling a Dream at Sundance", "body": "\n \n For years this ski enclave has held the dual distinction of being the home of Robert Redford\u2019s Sundance movie festival and of some of the highest-end properties in the state.         \n\nWhere else can ski enthusiasts own a home with backdoor access to the slopes at a top-notch ski resort like Deer Valley? Not in Aspen, which is surrounded mostly by public land. The sense of exclusivity has drawn a bevy of movie moguls and celebs here to Park City, from Jeffrey Katzenberg to Will Smith, who have bought multimillion-dollar ski homes in the area.         \n\nWhile Sundance attracts A-listers and up-and-comers each year, the event hasn\u2019t been much help in the past for brokers trying to sell high-end properties. That was especially true after the recession scared off investors hoping for quick returns. Brokers now say they\u2019re seeing more buyers who are not so interested in flipping, but instead are looking for good long-term investments.         \n\nSo taking a popular page out of the playbook used in places like  \n,  \n and  \n, some in the real estate community took a different tack at Sundance this year. Rather than the hordes of actors, directors and producers, they sought to connect with another growing cohort of the Sundance experience: the executive crowd.         \n\nOn a hill in the exclusive Deer Crest neighborhood, a crowd of the wealthy and connected mixed and mingled at the \u201cSki Dream House,\u201d a 13,500-square-foot home owned by the vacation rental company Resorts West that has 6 bedrooms, 15 fireplaces, a ski bar and backdoor access to the slopes. Its price tag: $21.9 million.         \n\nThis was no ordinary open house. Over two days, the guests sipped $500 V\u00e9rit\u00e9 wines and nibbled on contemporary Korean fare prepared by David Shim the chef of Kristalbelli in Manhattan, while being able to test-drive Rolls Royces, hear pitches about private jets and try on ski goggles with built-in cameras. Armani publicized a new fragrance, Essenza, while Hasselblad orchestrated the North American debut of a $6,000 camera, the Lunar, which comes in 14-carat, 18-carat and rose-gold versions.         \n\nDownstairs in the \u201cChill Room\u201d a D.J. entertained the crowd between screenings and receptions for movies like \u201cRunning From Crazy,\u201d the exploration of Mariel Hemingway\u2019s family history of suicide and mental illness. Nearby, next to a 550-gallon fish tank, a Sony representative demonstrated an 84-inch TV that lists for $25,000. Sony also provided the HD projector for the 14-seat home theater, which was screening \u201cLawrence of Arabia\u201d when I dropped by.         \n\nResorts West hired the Manhattan-based Rand Luxury to organize the event. Bradford Rand, the company\u2019s president, said he had run similar events, like the \u201cRed Cross Ball\u201d at an $18 million  \n estate. Mr. Rand organized events in 2007 and 2008, before the home finally sold in 2009, he said. (This kind of cross-branding  \n in December at  \n, where cocktail parties hosted by investment banks doubled as chances to show off high-end developments on Miami Beach.)         \n\nBrokers say recent sales suggest that Park City is drawing big buyers.         \n\nAn eight-bedroom Park City ranch sold last week for $16 million to a dot-com billionaire from California. A 63-acre estate owned by Jon Huntsman Sr., the richest man in Utah, has an interested buyer after being listed for $44 million, the highest asking price ever in Utah, said Paul Benson, a broker with Sotheby\u2019s in Park City. A giant ski cabin that Mr. Katzenberg, the DreamWorks co-founder, commissioned some 20 years ago and used to entertain friends like Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton, is on the market for $20.5 million.         \n\n\u201cThe last few years we had to beg to get people to come\u201d during Sundance, Mr. Benson said. \u201cReal estate wasn\u2019t really a hot topic. But this year that has changed. The people are actually spending money to be here. They aren\u2019t here because they had free tickets. They are looking at high-end homes. It is 2006 all over again.\u201d         \n\nBefore the housing bust, Mr. Benson tried to use Sundance to draw buyers to luxury properties in Park City. Since 2006 he has hosted  \n an event featuring celebrity chefs. He helped Prudential, which he worked for at the time, to sell more than 20 condos in the Waldorf, he said. It was after Sundance in 2006 that attendees soured on high-end real estate in the area, brokers said.         \n\nThis year Mr. Benson is once again hosting \u201cChef Dance.\u201d But he has also helped sponsor an event for the private banking group of JPMorgan, as well as for a group from Google. \u201cThey all want real estate information,\u201d Mr. Benson said, \u201cso we have had to tailor brochures for these events.\u201d         \n\nHigh-end developers are moving in, meaning that Park City is likely to get more expensive. Kenneth Abdalla, a former investment banker from  \n who now resides mostly in Park City, has bought seven properties along Main Street in the past 16 months for a total of over $100 million, Mr. Benson said.
