{"headline": "Immigration Poses Threat of Another Republican Rift", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A push to bring immigration legislation to the House floor, led by an unusual coalition of business executives, prominent conservatives and evangelical leaders, threatens to create another schism in the Republican Party and could have a noticeable effect on campaign contributions before the midterm elections.         \n\nSeveral Republican executives and donors who are part of a lobbying blitz coming to Capitol Hill next week said they were considering withholding, or had already decided to withhold, future financial support to Republican lawmakers they believe are obstructing progress on immigration.         \n\n\u201cI respect people\u2019s views and concerns about the fact that we have a situation in the United States where we have millions of undocumented immigrants,\u201d said Justin Sayfie, a lawyer from Florida who said he helped Mitt Romney raise more than $100,000 for his presidential campaign last year, in addition to helping other Republican candidates. \u201cBut we have what we have. This is October 2013. And the country will be better off if we fix it.\u201d         \n\nCapitol Hill has for months been the focus of immigration advocates urging lawmakers to take up one of the four measures that have been approved by the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee. What is different about next week\u2019s lobbying effort is that it will include about 600 mostly conservative leaders in business, agriculture and religion who will focus on 80 representatives from 40 states \u2014 all of them Republican.         \n\nThe effort comes just weeks after House conservatives alienated many longtime supporters, including much of corporate America, by trying to block financing for Mr. Obama\u2019s health care law, a move widely blamed for the government shutdown. The intraparty tension that was apparent in the budget standoff could resurface in the immigration fight, though the sides may not align in exactly the same way.         \n\nSponsors of next week\u2019s event include the  \n; the  \n;  \n, a political action group set up by Silicon Valley executives including Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook; and the  \n, which is led jointly by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, Rupert Murdoch and Bill Marriott Jr.         \n\nPushing back against the pressure to act from within their own party, a core group of conservatives said in interviews this week that they would not be intimidated by corporate America or other outside parties, even though in this case that includes farmers, evangelical leaders and some prominent conservatives.         \n\n\u201cI care about the sovereignty of the United States of America and what it stands for, and not an open-door policy,\u201d said Representative Ted Yoho, Republican of Florida, who is one of several conservatives opposing all of the bills the House is currently considering.         \n\nThough House Republican leaders \u2014 including Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio and Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader \u2014 have expressed support for moving on their own immigration measure this year, given that the Senate has already passed a comprehensive bill, the prospect for any legislation before year\u2019s end is uncertain.         \n\nThere is intense division within the party over the proposals under consideration, and some hard-line conservative members have made it clear that they have no interest in advancing a key part of Mr. Obama\u2019s agenda.         \n\nEven some who support a measure to increase border security say they would not vote for such a bill, fearing that it could become a vehicle to grant citizenship to an estimated 11 million immigrants in the United States illegally.         \n\n\u201cWe have seen the character of this president, and the way that he does business,\u201d said Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, explaining why he would oppose any measure.         \n\nLooking to restart discussion on immigration after months when it was overshadowed by foreign policy crises and the budget dispute, Mr. Obama spoke at the White House on Thursday and said Democrats and Republicans in the House must unite to pass an immigration package.         \n\n\u201cEverybody wins here if we work together to get this done,\u201d the president said.
