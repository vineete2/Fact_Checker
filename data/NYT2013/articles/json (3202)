{"headline": "Kindness, and Cold Shoulders, After Sandy", "body": "\nYana Fishman stood on the porch of her townhouse Saturday and remembered what it was like to come home to \u201csomething straight out of a nightmare.\u201d         \n\nOn the night of Oct. 29, 2012,  \n engulfed Fishman\u2019s Staten Island neighborhood in seawater. Her entire ground floor was submerged in maybe 10 feet of it, and everything the water touched was destroyed. Closets full of winter clothes. Furniture in the family room. The walls.         \n\nOutside, it looked as if a tornado had hit: a house that had once stood about a hundred feet down the block now rested across the street, battered and askew in a field. And that was far from the worst of it. Three of Fishman\u2019s neighbors, including a man across the street, were later found dead in their basements.         \n\n\u201cAll that happened here and the city was talking about hosting a marathon \u2014 a running race, when people died here?\u201d Fishman, 33, said. \u201cFor days, we didn\u2019t even have government officials or the Red Cross here. We all were like: \u2018What about us? You\u2019ve abandoned us.\u2019         \n\n\u201cBut then,\u201d she said, as her voice began to crack, \u201cthen came the marathoners.\u201d         \n\nWhen the  \n was canceled \u2014 a move that came sorely late, nearly three days after the storm hit \u2014 47,000 runners suddenly had no plans for Marathon Sunday.         \n\nThousands chose to spend the day running a makeshift marathon in Central Park. Another group decided it was needed elsewhere.         \n\nLike a battalion of soldiers in spandex, thousands of runners headed to Staten Island. Hundreds descended upon Fishman\u2019s neighborhood, Oakwood Beach. When Fishman saw them coming, it took her breath away.         \n\n\u201cThey were strangers, from Australia, from Ohio, all over the world,\u201d she said, wiping tears. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have to come. They didn\u2019t owe us anything. But they came. I didn\u2019t even know their names.\u201d         \n\nI  \n last year. All had paid the high fees to enter the marathon. Many had opened their wallets again for airplane tickets and expensive hotel rooms. And all put aside their investments of time and money for an unexpected opportunity to get filthy. Really filthy.         \n\nIn Oakwood Beach, they ripped crumbling wallboard, gathered clumps of muddy reeds in their hands, lugged impossibly heavy, wet furniture onto curbs. They knelt in muck to scrub floors. \u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine running,\u201d one said, \u201cwhen there are people who need help.\u201d         \n\nBack in Manhattan, others  \n. Many of them had excoriated marathon organizers and city officials for canceling the race on short notice. One of my friends complained that he had spent months raising money for a charity, and that those people needed the money just as much as the people affected by the hurricane.         \n\n\u201cHow can people be so selfish?\u201d he said.         \n\nHe and the other complainers would have had a different attitude if they had seen Oakwood Beach after the waters receded \u2014 and if they could see it now. I returned last weekend expecting to see people rebuilding their community. What I found was more like a ghost town.         \n\nThe Halloween decorations in the windows \u2014 cutout black cats, giant spiders \u2014 are not for this year\u2019s trick-or-treaters; they are left over from last year. Many houses are boarded up, or gone altogether. In one stretch, the houses have been razed,  \n.         \n\nAbout three-quarters of the residents never returned after the storm.         \n\n\u201cThe marathoners gave us a huge boost in morale,\u201d Frank Lettieri said, \u201cbut, you know, for a lot of people here, life as they knew it ended when Sandy hit.\u201d Lettieri lives next to a now-empty lot where a father and son died in the storm.         \n\nSeeing that neighborhood now made me think of how much effort was wasted to save last year\u2019s marathon. Mary Wittenberg, the chief executive of New York Road Runners, spent long hours and late nights negotiating with city officials. Prerace events were canceled so organizers could focus on the main event. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said the people who died in the storm would want the city to go on.         \n\nIt all seems even more callous now. They all missed the point. We are often told that the marathon\u2019s economic impact on the region is in the hundreds of millions of dollars. But event organizers and politicians should stop pushing the false notion that a city needs a sporting event to bounce back from a tragedy.         \n\nWhen baseball returned after Sept. 11, some claimed it would help heal the country. When the Saints returned to New Orleans after  \n, lawmakers and team officials hailed the moment as helping to revive the city. But the people who profit from sporting events should never be the ones who decide what a community needs in its darkest hour. The residents of Oakwood Beach could have told them that.         \n\nHolding a marathon wouldn\u2019t have helped Yana Fishman or her neighbors. They didn\u2019t need people to cheer for them. A running singlet with the words \u201cFor Staten Island\u201d wouldn\u2019t have helped them salvage their soaking-wet wedding albums or their waterlogged mattresses. It wouldn\u2019t have brought their neighbors back.         \n\nThousands of runners last year missed out on a unique opportunity to make a mark on the people of Oakwood Beach, and it\u2019s too late for them to make it right. The neighborhood, home to generations of families, is being erased. With the aim of returning the area to its original marshland, the state  \n. Nearly all have applied for them.         \n\nFishman and her family were early takers. On Saturday, they loaded their belongings into a U-Haul truck and pointed it toward Denver, and a new life. Down the street, Esther and Steven Tauscher spent the weekend looking for a new place to call home.         \n\nEsther Tauscher said one of the positive memories of a terrible year remained the marathoners who came to help when she and her neighbors needed it the most.         \n\n\u201cWe got something from the volunteers, but I think they also got something from us, you know?\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a spiritual thing. A good deed gives you, what can I say, grace? Yeah, that\u2019s it. It gives you grace.\u201d         \n\nAnd who couldn\u2019t use more of that?
