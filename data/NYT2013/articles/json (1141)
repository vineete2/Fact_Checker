{"headline": "Olympics Invite Trouble When Politics Drive Choices", "body": "\nLess than two months before the opening ceremony of the Sochi Olympics, the 2014 Winter Games are making headlines again, but \u2014 as usual \u2014 the big news is not about the athletes or the competitions. It\u2019s about politics.         \n\n \n announced on Tuesday that he would not attend the Olympics, and neither would the vice president, the first lady or any former United States president or vice president. The last time an American presidential delegation lacked high-powered officials like those was 1988, and the move is likely to impart a stinging message to  \n, the Russian president, who considers these Olympics his pet project.         \n\nWhat is worse for Putin is that Obama will send a delegation that includes the tennis legend  \n and a two-time Olympian in ice hockey, Caitlin Cahow. Both are openly gay, and both are probably Obama\u2019s way of answering back to Putin for Russia\u2019s antigay laws.         \n\nBut whether you agree with Obama\u2019s decision or not, ask yourself this: Why are we talking about this, and how did Olympians end up in the middle of a caustic debate about human rights \u2014 yet again?         \n\nThe last time this happened on a scale like this was before and during the 2008 Beijing Olympics, when human rights violations, censorship and severe air pollution made people wonder how the  \n had awarded the Olympics to China in the first place. I\u2019ll tell you how: politics and influence and self-interest.         \n\nDon\u2019t let the I.O.C. fool you with its rhetoric about being free of politics, as sports should be, because it isn\u2019t. And as a result, having the best bid for the Games is no guarantee that a particular city will be picked.         \n\nWhen I.O.C. members chose Sochi seven years ago to play host to the 2014 Games, they should have known that they were asking for trouble. Anyone who was paying attention back then knew that choosing Sochi had its drawbacks, not the least being that it is in the Caucasus region, one of the world\u2019s most troubled hot spots. The Olympic Village is about five miles, walking distance for some, from Abkhazia, one of two breakaway regions of Georgia that ignited a war between that country and Russia in 2008. The restive region of Chechnya is also pretty much just down the road.         \n\nBut the I.O.C. chose Russia anyway, with Putin himself helping to win the bid for his favorite beach vacation spot by showing up to address the I.O.C. just before the vote that allowed Sochi to win out over its competition. He spoke in English, shocking nearly everyone in Moscow with his willingness to break from Russian.         \n\nHe was charming, and he guaranteed that \u201cthe Olympic family is going to feel at home.\u201d He ended his speech by speaking briefly in French, which, along with English, is an official language of the Olympic movement.         \n\nPutin is one of the most powerful people in the world, and the fact that he felt compelled to put the finishing touches on Sochi\u2019s bid, that its quality could not stand on its own, speaks to the political dynamics that ultimately sway the I.O.C.         \n\nIn reality, the other two finalists that year \u2014 Pyeongchang, South Korea, and Salzburg, Austria \u2014 probably had the better bids. But other factors won the day, just as they nearly always do, in one form or another, when the I.O.C. is involved. Remember the bribery scandal that surrounded Salt Lake City\u2019s successful bid for the Winter Games? The fact that the I.O.C. has put that episode behind it does not mean that it has rid itself of all questionable allegiances and alliances. It does not mean I.O.C. members cannot be influenced by a bid city that is good at courting, bestowing favors and using its muscle.         \n\nIn the past, some of the I.O.C.\u2019s selections of Olympic cities have come about because the organization wanted to broaden the reach of the Olympic movement. Fair enough. That is how the Summer Olympics ended up in China, which guaranteed the I.O.C. that there would be no Internet censorship and that Beijing\u2019s air would be relatively pristine.         \n\nBut in the news media center during those games, there were times that reporters could not connect to some websites, including those of The Washington Post and Amnesty International. The day after the Olympics ended, I opened the curtains in my hotel room to find that the heavy smog that had long plagued the city had returned. So much for the Olympics changing the country for the better.         \n\nChina had promised the I.O.C. so many improvements. The I.O.C. bought it because it wanted to. But in the end, the Games did little to change the country\u2019s mind-set. The same thing is likely to happen in Sochi.         \n\nIf the I.O.C. chose its cities more carefully, perhaps we would not be wondering whether athletes should be worried about showing their support for gay rights when they are in Russia. Of course, a couple of more votes for Pyeongchang seven years ago and we might be talking about the security issues in that city, which is close to unstable North Korea. Not much better, right? But we will have a chance to worry about that, anyway, because the I.O.C. chose Pyeongchang, over Munich and Annecy, France, to host the 2018 Winter Olympics.         \n\nPerhaps that choice will ultimately be seen as evidence of still more questionable decision-making by the I.O.C.         \n\nOn the immediate Olympic horizon is Sochi, then Rio de Janeiro in 2016. Already, the decision to give Rio the Games has become an issue because the city has been evicting poor residents of some of the country\u2019s biggest slums to make way for Olympic construction.         \n\nUltimately, when we talk about the Olympics, it sometimes seems that we rarely focus on the athletes themselves. We talk about whether there will be snow \u2014 Vancouver 2010 \u2014 instead of who will be skiing on it. More significant, we talk about whether athletes will protest antigay laws in the manner of Tommie Smith and John Carlos\u2019s black power salute on the Olympic podium in 1968 in Mexico City. The I.O.C. has set us up for this.         \n\nBut perhaps the I.O.C. has learned its lesson. Last fall, it chose Tokyo \u2014 which brilliantly promoted itself as a \u201cvery low-risk\u201d choice \u2014 to host the 2020 Summer Games, choosing it over Istanbul.         \n\nSome I.O.C. members were interested in taking the Olympics to Turkey, a Muslim country, which would have been a significant step. Others, though, balked at the fact that Istanbul had never hosted a huge sporting event and that Syria, which Turkey borders, was in the throes of a bloody conflict.         \n\nIn that instance, sensible voters won out. Let\u2019s hope that was the start of a trend.
