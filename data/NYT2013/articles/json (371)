{"headline": "Q. and A. With Clint Dempsey", "body": "\nIt has been a long, long soccer season for Clint Dempsey, the captain of the United States national team who plays professionally in England\u2019s Premier League for Tottenham Hotspur.         \n\nIn his first season with Spurs after a transfer from Fulham, Dempsey was third on the team in goals and second in assists. He played in 29 Premier League games, starting 22, and appeared in 43 in all competitions, starting 32.         \n\nHe is No. 3 on the United States national team\u2019s career goal-scoring list with 32, two goals behind Eric Wynalda. Tuesday\u2019s World Cup qualifying match against Honduras in Sandy, Utah, will be Dempsey\u2019s last before he rejoins Spurs for preseason training and exhibition matches in Asia in July. Dempsey spoke with Jack Bell of The Times as he prepared for the Honduras match, about his role as captain, his partnership with Jozy Altidore and his future in England.         \n\n \n  \n         \n\n \n Very good. The team is confident. We\u2019re on a good run of form, getting good results. We just have to keep our feet on the ground and make sure we get full points on Tuesday. I think with two or three more wins we qualify [for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil].         \n\n \n  \n         \n\n \n It is difficult, especially with our schedule and going at it all year in Europe. But everyone has to deal with that. You get to rest in the summer. You do have to deal with the situations, there\u2019s not much turnaround, but you\u2019ve got to be ready to go on any given day. So far, the schedule has been good for us. We came up from Jamaica to the Northwest, someplace I haven\u2019t played for a long time. It was a great atmosphere.         \n\n \n  \n         \n\n \n Yeah, I\u2019m looking forward to the rest. But I want to go into it on a good note. I don\u2019t want to have this last result set the tone. I don\u2019t want to go home with a draw or a loss. Three points will make me feel good.         \n\nI only have about three and half weeks off. I go back to England on July 18 or 19, then we\u2019re flying to Hong Kong for preseason training and a couple of games.         \n\n \n  \n         \n\n \n I think the team is playing really well, and I\u2019m playing better also. There\u2019s more movement off the ball, more confidence in the team. When the team plays better, individuals play better as well. We\u2019re just playing good soccer. We want to keep the momentum and keep building that consistency going into every game.         \n\n \n  \n         \n\n \n Yeah, I think there\u2019s something to that. Everybody comes in different stages of their seasons. Some are playing in Europe, some in M.L.S. Some playing consistently, some aren\u2019t. There are different formations and styles and for it to come together you all have to be on the same page. When you come in with the national team, there\u2019s an adjustment period. Sometimes you don\u2019t have time to adjust. It\u2019s just about trying to keep that consistency with the national team and trying to remember what it\u2019s like. Saying you shouldn\u2019t miss a beat is easier said than done.         \n\nBut I\u2019m curious ... why do you say Jozy and I are playing better? We\u2019re hearing that a lot.         \n\n \n  \n         \n\n \n Yeah, I think the turning point for me was the camp in March. After the first Honduras game there was a lot of drama around the team. We had to come together. We got a good result against Costa Rica and getting a point in Mexico doesn\u2019t happen very often. We just played two tough games that we were trying to get something out of, and then comes the qualifiers.         \n\nWe did get confidence against Germany, we were able to score a good number of goals and we\u2019ve been scoring two goals a game since the Belgium game. I would say it\u2019s confidence. That\u2019s the turning point. You get wins and get points and you naturally start feeling better about the situation. You feel less pressure and you\u2019re able to play with more freedom. That\u2019s a big factor.         \n\n \n  \n         \n\n \n I think that more was made out of it than what was really going on with the team. I also feel that sometimes it\u2019s good to talk about whatever the problems might be. In the end, we came together as a team. We\u2019re the only people in the room who can change the situation. All we all want to do is qualify for the World Cup.         \n\n \n  \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/18/sports/soccer/q-and-a-with-clint-dempsey.html", "date": "2013-06-17", "description": "The striker for the United States national soccer team and Tottenham Hotspur spoke with Jack Bell of The Times."}
