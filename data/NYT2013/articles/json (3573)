{"headline": "Officials Detail Premium Costs of Health Plan", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration on Tuesday provided the first detailed look at premiums to be charged to consumers for health insurance in 36 states where the federal government will run new insurance markets starting next week, highlighting costs it said were generally lower than previous estimates.         \n\nAdministration officials released the information, central to their campaign to persuade millions of uninsured Americans to sign up for coverage, even as Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, waged a fierce fight on the Senate floor, risking a government shutdown if necessary to eliminate financing for the expansion of coverage under President Obama\u2019s health care law.         \n\nThe White House sought to focus attention on what it portrayed as the financial advantages of the health insurance program, which is set to start accepting customers on Oct. 1.         \n\n\u201cI can tell you right now that in many states across the country, if you\u2019re, say, a 27-year-old young woman, don\u2019t have health insurance, you get on that exchange, you\u2019re going to be able to purchase high-quality health insurance for less than the cost of your cellphone bill,\u201d Mr. Obama said Tuesday, speaking at a health care forum in New York City with former President Bill Clinton.         \n\nFor a benchmark plan \u2014 the second-lowest-cost \u201csilver plan,\u201d covering 70 percent of projected medical costs for a typical consumer \u2014 the average premium nationally will be $328 a month for individuals, the administration said in a new report.         \n\nFor a family of four with an annual income of $50,000, the administration said, monthly premiums for the second-cheapest plan will vary widely, averaging $600 in Arizona, $800 in Georgia, $961 in Indiana, $1,069 in Mississippi, $859 in New Hampshire, $943 in New Jersey and $656 in Utah.         \n\nUnder the 2010 health law, most people buying insurance in the exchanges will be eligible for federal subsidies in the form of tax credits. Taking account of these subsidies, the administration said, a family of four with income of $50,000 will generally be able to buy a silver-level plan for $282 a month, while a 27-year-old with income of $25,000 will be able to get such coverage for $145 a month.         \n\nHowever, the data provided only a partial picture of the reality that consumers will face. The government did not identify the insurance companies offering policies in the federal marketplaces, also known as exchanges. Nor did it provide any information about the many policies that will cost more than the amounts cited in its report. Such information will not be available until the exchanges open, federal health officials said. Republicans and other critics of the health program were likely to take issue with the financial picture painted by the administration as the new premium information became more widely known.         \n\nThe figures, almost by definition, provide a favorable view of costs, highlighting the least expensive coverage in each state.         \n\nConsumer advocates said that people shopping for health insurance should consider not only price, but also other factors like the list of covered drugs and the doctors and hospitals available in a health plan.         \n\n\u201cWe are excited to see that rates in the marketplace are even lower than originally projected,\u201d said Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services. Insurance, she said, will be affordable even to low- and moderate-income people.         \n\nGary M. Cohen, the director of the federal Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight, said that premiums were generally lower in states with vigorous competition in their insurance markets and robust programs to review rates.         \n\nIn the 36 states where the federal government has primary responsibility for the exchanges, Mr. Cohen said, consumers will be able to choose from an average of 53 health plans. In most states, health plans will be offered by two or more insurance companies \u2014 a high of 13 companies in Wisconsin, but just one apiece in New Hampshire and West Virginia.         \n\n\u201cAbout one in four of these insurance companies is offering health plans in the individual market for the first time in 2014, a sign of healthy competition,\u201d Mr. Cohen said.
