{"headline": "9 Points, 4 Goals and Looking Ahead", "body": "\nWhat a month.         \n\nIt\u2019s truly hard to put into words how exciting and memorable June has been for me.         \n\nThe obvious thrill came three times over when my United States teammates and I pulled off huge victories against Jamaica, Panama and Honduras in World Cup qualifying. Getting those nine points and earning a spot alone atop the Hex was huge in our quest to make that coveted trip to Brazil next year.         \n\nI think it\u2019s safe to say \u2014 and obvious for those watching us \u2014 that we\u2019ve really continued to develop a chemistry with one another and grown as a team with each match. I know I see and feel it, so hopefully the fans and soccer pundits have noticed the improvement from the start of camp to where we are currently as a team.         \n\nIt won\u2019t be for another few months or so that we come together again, so hopefully we pick up where we left off in Utah and remember what helped us get such positive results.         \n\nPersonally, it goes without saying those games were extremely important. Scoring for my country in all three qualifiers, as well in the US Soccer Centennial friendly against Germany, was simply great and showed how well we are clicking as an offensive unit.         \n\nAt that level of play, we aren\u2019t going to get an abundant amount of quality scoring opportunities. So finding the back of the next was satisfying and hopefully made the fans proud.         \n\nAs I finish this latest blog entry back home in Florida, I\u2019m getting ready for my trip to New York City for a bunch of appearances, interviews and other events.         \n\nI was set to participate in a special event, highlighted by a charity auction, at the Astor Center, which was held Wednesday, where athletes and some of the country\u2019s most decorated chefs joined forces with the Partnership at Drugfree.org to raise awareness for the organization. I put together a great package for the auction with my New York Red Bulls family, so I\u2019m excited to see how much money we can raise for the organization.         \n\nOn Thursday, I am doing something I truly love and that\u2019s meeting fans. I will be at Upper 90 soccer store for an autograph-signing session from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. at its Upper West Side location. There will be a suggested donation for items being signed, with all the money raised going toward projects with the Jozy Altidore Foundation.         \n\nUntil then, it\u2019s back to packing and getting in that \u201cEmpire State of Mind\u201d (cue Jay-Z and Alicia Keys). As always, thank you for the continued support for me and my teammates. Our fans and supporters are truly amazing. I can\u2019t wait to get back on the field later this summer wearing the red, white and blue.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/27/sports/soccer/9-points-4-goals-and-looking-ahead.html", "date": "2013-06-26", "description": "U.S. striker Jozy Altidore is in New York this week for a number of appearances after scoring goals for the national team in each of its last four games."}
