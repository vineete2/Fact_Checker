{"headline": "A Debutante With Lesbian Moms: How Does She Come Out?", "body": "\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n Indeed, this is not the kind of \u201ccoming out\u201d issue I usually address, but what an interesting question \u2014 and one that on second glance is much more layered than it first appears. For the 99 percent of us who are not a part of \u201cSociety,\u201d your query is really a stand-in for all the other situations where a daughter with lesbian moms might lack a dad for certain rituals, like \u201cfather/daughter\u201d dances and being \u201cgiven away\u201d at her wedding.         \n\nBoomers may be forgiven for needing their memories jogged on this one: cotillions have gone in and out of favor over the decades (and the centuries), and they weren\u2019t hot tickets when we were coming of age. But  \n. Cotillion and debutante parties are milestone events, akin to a quincea\u00f1era or a Sweet 16 party, at which parents present their newly adult (and thus marriageable) daughter to the world. While they are a link to a time when society was highly stratified,  \nare much more likely to highlight their charitable aims than ever before, part of a new public relations spin to make them seem more modern and relevant. Still, the crux of the evening is a father\u2019s \u201cpresentation\u201d of his daughter to \u201csociety,\u201d and to potential husbands. Traditionally, the deb would do the first dance with dear old dad.         \n\nMy first question goes to your daughter: Does she want to be part of a tradition that to many seems old-fashioned, patriarchal and better forgotten? My  \n were even more emphatic, with one crying out, \u201cSO BOURGEOIS\u201d (yes, in caps) and another, sardonically: \u201cCotillion? 2013!!! My darling, wake up.\u201d Regardless, this is  \n decision.         \n\nLet\u2019s assume your daughter\u2019s answer is \u201cyes.\u201d Then she has more decisions to make: Who does she want to present her? With whom does she want to have that first dance? Does she want to acknowledge her two moms as part of her debut? That might make for a double \u201ccoming out,\u201d even if her family\u2019s makeup is known to the community. One lesbian mother of two girls told me: \u201cI would be sympathetic to a teenager who doesn\u2019t want her moms in the cotillion.\u201d Agreed, that\u2019s a lot of social pressure and visibility \u2013  \n, no less, a state with no protections for L.G.B.T. people.         \n\nNow for you: How do you and your wife feel about the possibility that one of you may be rendered less visible (even invisible) by having a male friend or relative step in? Or, depending on your point of view, how do you feel about playing the role of father quite so publicly? Either way, as  \n, named Debutante of the Decade for the \u201880s and now known as a promoter of veganism and marriage equality, told me over the phone: \u201cThey\u2019re going to need to have some really strong backbones to do it.\u201d Agreed.         \n\nIn some ways, your situation is not without precedent. After all, there have been many young girls whose fathers were absent \u2014 in the military, deceased, divorced from the family. In those cases, protocol was straightforward: another male stepped into the role.         \n\nBut there\u2019s a huge difference between a young lady with a departed dad and one with two moms and no dad. Ms. Guest agreed: \u201cI think it\u2019s completely \u2018unetiquette\u2019 to have a male step in,\u201d she said, adding about the mothers, \u201cHow dare people treat them with disrespect.\u201d Your situation is very different than a family with an absent father; as times change, so too must our social institutions, even debutante balls.         \n\nAs your daughter has been invited (which makes it pretty much a done deal), the \u201ccommittee\u201d must be well aware of your family situation, which gives your debutante-in-waiting various options. The three of you should talk it over and decide whether one or both moms will present her. Whether she chooses one of you or prefers a threesome, walk in proudly, arm in arm with your beautiful daughter. Just as you\u2019ve no doubt done for her whole life, show your daughter you are proud of her, and of your family. (By the way, I would give the committee a head\u2019s up on any unorthodoxy.)         \n\nAs for the \u201cfather/daughter\u201d dance, I wouldd suggest that one mother start, and the other finish. Or, as a 1976 \u201cdouble deb\u201d (she came out at two balls) suggested: \u201cThe two mothers could walk hand in hand to the dance floor, do a twirl with their daughter and then let the first escort cut in.\u201d         \n\nSure, this may be awkward but such is the nature of changing social mores. As Ms. Guest said: \" It\u2019s very important that children are shown that their parents step up for what\u2019s right.\u201d And consider this practice for the next set of rituals that are likely coming your way: figuring out who will play the father-of-the bride role at her wedding and all the attendant rituals. I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t outsource that to a male friend or relative.         \n\n \n My  \n came from an Army sergeant who asked for some help introducing his girlfriend to his commander and his new husband. Specifically, he wondered whether to refer to the spouse as a husband. He e-mailed me an update this past week: \u201cWhen Jennifer and I met with them it went off without a hitch. The introduction went as follows: \u201cJennifer, this is Colonel Smith and his husband, Mr. Andrews.\u201d And since Colonel Smith knows that I call Jennifer \u201cMy Hot Blonde Girlfriend\u201d he said, \u201cHun, this is Sgt. Taylor\u2019s Hot Blonde Girlfriend, Jennifer.\u201d It was so nice and a great ice-breaker and they both really appreciated that I took the initiative to say \u201cHusband.\u201d         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/08/booming/a-debutante-with-lesbian-moms-how-does-she-come-out.html", "date": "2013-10-08", "description": "A cotillion is just one situation where a daughter with lesbian moms might lack a dad:  \u201cfather/daughter\u201d dances or being \u201cgiven away\u201d at her wedding."}
