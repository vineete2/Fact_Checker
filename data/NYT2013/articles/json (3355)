{"headline": "First Rentals: Native New York Style", "body": "\nFor young New Yorkers seeking their first postcollege apartment in the city, the setting of one\u2019s childhood can cast a long shadow. The home where they grew up, whether it was a Classic 6 or far more modest, can leave a strong imprint.         \n\nAs a result of this pull, growing numbers of these postgrads do live at home for a while. The more they see what\u2019s out there, the better that home looks, to both them and their parents, who often have to help out with future housing bills.         \n\nOthers, determined to strike out on their own, know that city apartments have always been small and expensive, and that finding decent and affordable housing in New York, especially in  \n, has never been easy. They know that they will need roommates, maybe lots of them, to make the numbers add up. And they don\u2019t suffer the sticker shock that hits their out-of-town counterparts like a punch in the jaw.         \n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re apartment-hunting and you\u2019re from the city, you don\u2019t wonder where the swimming pool is, or the dining room or the valet parking,\u201d said Blair Brandt, the chief executive of the Next Step Realty, a brokerage that serves young graduates seeking apartments in New York. \u201cKids from New York don\u2019t ask those questions.\u201d         \n\nThe Next Step, along with start-ups like MyGradPad, is part of a growing niche industry designed to help young renters navigate the shoals of fly-by-night brokers and daunting paperwork.         \n\nBecause, as native New Yorkers, they know the city intimately, they\u2019re open to distant or emerging neighborhoods. Places like Gowanus in  \n or Ridgewood in  \n are not unfamiliar names on the fringes of a map of Manhattan, but communities where they\u2019ve visited friends, gone to parties, hung out. These young people also know how to navigate the subway system, no small issue when it comes to establishing a toehold on a street far from the city\u2019s center.         \n\n\u201cKids raised in New York not only have a much more realistic set of expectations, they also have a more pioneering mentality,\u201d said Gary Malin, the president of Citi Habitats, a firm that deals heavily in rentals and thus serves waves of new graduates each spring. \u201cBecause they grew up here, they realize that neighborhoods change and evolve, often for the better, the way the East Village has. To outsiders, nearly every place is foreign.\u201d         \n\nProximity to one\u2019s parents, or lack thereof, is also a key issue; running into Mom at the grocery store is the last thing many new graduates want. \u201cThere\u2019s no point claiming independence if you\u2019re five blocks from your parents,\u201d Mr. Brandt said. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to pull the trigger, pull it far.\u201d         \n\nStatistics compiled by his agency show that returning graduates typically want to put at least 40 blocks between their new home and the one they grew up in. If your parents live uptown, you want to be downtown, and vice versa. Turning your back on all-too-familiar streets also has its charms. Many young people who grew up in Brooklyn, for example, want to make sure a river separates their new home from the old.         \n\nHere are the stories of three newly minted graduates, lifelong New Yorkers, who stand at various points on the apartment-hunting spectrum. All are learning hard-won lessons about the city\u2019s challenging housing market.         \n\nHarris Meyers grew up in a two-bedroom co-op on East 18th Street, blessed with a terrace that overlooked Gramercy Park, but modest enough in size that his parents had to wall off part of the dining nook to create a bedroom for his younger sister.         \n\nAt the  \n, which Mr. Meyers attended from sixth grade on, he made a pack of close friends \u2014 \u201cmy guys,\u201d he calls them \u2014 with whom he remained close even after going off to Ithaca College. And after he graduates this weekend with a shiny new degree in marketing and communications, he\u2019ll head back to his childhood home, to the bedroom decorated with Little League trophies and posters of Derek Jeter and Muhammad Ali.         \n\nSpending a year at home, no great hardship in a big and buzzy city like New York, will give Mr. Meyers, who is 21, time to find a job, pay off some college loans and get his act together when it comes to finding a place of his own. The first task is assembling the group of friends, possibly as many as half a dozen, who will be his roommates. The second is choosing a neighborhood.
