{"headline": "A Christmas Spent at the Bar Can Be Joyous, Too", "body": "\nPoor George Bailey. As if he weren\u2019t already teetering on the edge, a  \n Eve visit to a bar is no help to Jimmy Stewart\u2019s desperate protagonist in \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life.\u201d Just before resolving to end it all, he gets hammered at the hands of  \n in a bar where even an angel gets no respect.         \n\nThen there\u2019s Jack Lemmon\u2019s hapless C. C. Baxter in \u201cThe Apartment,\u201d who is forced out of his lodgings on Christmas so his no-good boss can rendezvous there with his mistress, leaving Baxter with no choice but to repair to a saloon. There he finds  \n, but the merriment, as conceived by the brilliantly cynical Billy Wilder, is hollow at its core. Baxter chain-smokes and drinks martini after martini, fraternizing miserably with a fellowship of the forlorn.         \n\nThe message from these Hollywood classics is clear: a bar is no place to be at Christmas. It\u2019s a last resort, the bottom of the barrel, a holiday holding pen for losers and lowlifes, the unloved and unlucky.         \n\nI\u2019ve been there.         \n\nI\u2019ve never had it as bad as Bailey or Baxter, but I wasn\u2019t exactly in a jolly mood the first time I spent a good portion of my holiday in a bar. I think it was the winter of my junior year in college. I came home to New York to celebrate with my family and got into a screaming match with my mother at the dinner table on Christmas Day.         \n\nSo I did what any self-respecting, angst-ridden young person would do: I excused myself from the table, took a walk, had a good sulk, ate some Chinese food, saw a movie and, as my last stop before returning home, hit a bar. No place special. Nowhere I had been before.         \n\nBut instead of finding despair in there, I encountered a measure of cheer and comfort that had eluded me at home, at least that year. I had a whiskey and a few beers, and I enjoyed a nice chat with a friendly bartender, a couple of customers who had to work most of the day and another who was newish to New York.         \n\nI felt much better. I think we all did.         \n\nIt turns out that around the holidays, bars do exactly what they are always supposed to do: provide a place to blow off steam far from the demands of home or office. This season may be the most treasured time to spend with family, but it can also foment discord. Expectations are high. Our homes are supposed to be festively decked out. Our cooking should be perfectly timed and unimpeachably delicious.         \n\nWith the holidays come pressure, whether we spend them with our families or not. And the bar is one place that can relieve that pressure.         \n\nLike those whom I met during college break, many of the people you\u2019ll find at bars during the holidays are trying to relax after a workday or are new to town. But it\u2019s not a default for everyone; for some of us, it\u2019s a choice.         \n\nA bar holiday may be tinged with melancholy, but it\u2019s a sweet sort of melancholy. (Its tone is captured perfectly, I\u2019m compelled to say, in  \n on the \u201cJohn Denver and the Muppets: A Christmas Together\u201d TV special in 1979.)         \n\nI am not alone in my view that a bar can be a source of holiday comfort. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s anything special,\u201d the playwright Peter Gil-Sheridan said of Christmas at Flannery\u2019s Bar, an Irish dive on West 14th Street, \u201cbut it is to me.\u201d         \n\nMr. Gil-Sheridan found the bar years ago, when he was cat-sitting for a friend in the neighborhood. That friend later moved, but Mr. Gil-Sheridan, who lives in Brooklyn, still returns almost every Christmas to Flannery\u2019s, where the management serves a free turkey feast. \u201cI love that they unceremoniously put out some turkey and potatoes and stuffing and gravy,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no announcement. It\u2019s just there in the back because it\u2019s Christmas, so of course there\u2019s some turkey around. And you kind of discover it and think, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019ll have some of that.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nLast year, Mr. Gil-Sheridan and his partner had to fly to London on Christmas, but they considered taking a night flight so they could spend the day at Flannery\u2019s. \u201cIn the end, we decided against it, but I missed it,\u201d he said.         \n\nThere are others whose bar Christmases have more closely resembled George Bailey\u2019s. The British-born author and bartender Gary Regan recalled Christmas in 1975, his first in New York City. He was manning the bar at Drake\u2019s Drum, an Upper East Side establishment he describes as \u201ca neighborhood joint that attracted rugby players and their groupies\u201d as well as lawyers, plumbers and artists.         \n\nMr. Regan didn\u2019t relish the idea of working on Christmas, but his boss assured him the tips would make it worthwhile. Nearly 40 years later, he remembers this as the worst bar shift of his life. Each customer was surlier than the last. \u201cThere was a damned good reason nobody had invited them anywhere,\u201d he said,         \n\nI\u2019ve spent Christmas on the working side of a bar, too, at  \n in South Park Slope, Brooklyn. Last year, Christmas fell on a Tuesday, the day of my usual shift. I opened the bar at 5 p.m. The first hour was dead and foot traffic on Fifth Avenue was thin. \u201cWhy am I doing this?\u201d I wondered, bracing myself for a lonely night.         \n\nBut business picked up around 6, when regulars returned from early family dinners badly wanting drinks sans relatives. And, knowing that I was working for the holiday, several friends turned up to surprise me, not a few bearing cookies and leftover pie and other gifts. Some sang along as my favorite holiday playlist issued from the speakers (including Rowlf and John Denver, naturally). I lit some extra candles, and soon enough you could feel some genuine Christmas cheer warming the room like the hot toddies warming my customers.         \n\nEven if there\u2019s no room at the inn, there\u2019s plenty at the pub.         \n\n \nA sampling of bars open on Christmas.         \n\n \n         \n\nThis place, known for things like its killer jukebox and Kentucky Derby Day party, will open at 8 p.m. on  \n. Expect psychedelic holiday decorations and indie-rock Christmas anthems.  \n         \n\n \n         \n\nThe upstairs parlor will be closed at one of New York\u2019s great cocktail destinations, but the homey downstairs taproom will open at 5 p.m., offering delights like Irish coffee, hot whiskey punch and a special eggnog until it runs out.  \n         \n\n \n         \n\nThis Irish pub in Washington Heights will open at 11 a.m. Starting at 1 p.m. it will serve a prix fixe traditional Irish Christmas dinner, including roast turkey and baked ham.  \n         \n\n \n         \n\nIt\u2019ll be a family affair at this cozy local starting at 8 p.m., with Patsy Monteleone playing Christmas tunes on the ukulele and Ani mixing holiday cocktails named after relatives like the Cousin Vince.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nThis downtown stalwart will open at 4 p.m. On the menu: hot apple cider with bourbon and spice-laced \u201cwinter martinis.\u201d  \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/11/dining/a-christmas-spent-at-the-bar-can-be-joyous-too.html", "date": "2013-12-10", "description": "Holiday memories of drinking with strangers."}
