{"headline": "On the Road, With Mothers", "body": "\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nI went on a road trip with my mother in Northern California a few years back and if you were heading down the mountain on Route 101, you probably remember us. That\u2019s because cars were lined up behind us for at least three miles. Once in a while a driver would become so unhinged driving 35 miles per hour for 40 miles he would hit the gas hard in a no-pass zone, risking death in a ravine \u2014 an option, after being on the road for four days with my mother, I was wistfully considering myself.         \n\nThis wasn\u2019t because my mother was doing anything as heavy handed as saying, \u201cYou\u2019re going too fast.\u201d She just read the road signs out loud for a few hours, as if they were something she had just happened to see. \u201cForty-five miles an hour,\u201d \u201cThirty miles an hour.\u201d I think she figured this was subtle, and for her it was.         \n\n\u201cHave you noticed, Ma, that none of these people who are passing us have mothers sitting next to them telling them how to drive and yet they seem to be doing fine?\u201d I said.         \n\n\u201cHa ha. Very funny. Twenty miles an hour,\u201d my mother said.         \n\nI have been thinking of writing a book, \"How to Travel With Your Mother,\" but it would be a very short book. That is because my first tip is: Don\u2019t. Do not ever travel with your mother. Unless maybe you are disposing of her ashes. And even then there\u2019s a good chance you will hear her voice in your head:         \n\n\"You packed the box with my ashes without double wrapping it in Saran Wrap and putting it in a baggie? Look at this box, it\u2019s cardboard, it\u2019s nothing. What if I spill all over this suitcase? Because I can\u2019t help noticing that every one of your things has to be dry-cleaned. I don\u2019t own a thing that has to be dry-cleaned, if the label says dry clean I do not buy it. By the way, how are you planning to do this? If there\u2019s a wind, make sure it\u2019s not blowing at you and when you open the box, make sure you don\u2019t pour it over your head. Don\u2019t say \u2018Everybody knows that\u2019 because everybody does not know. I hope you didn\u2019t invite your father\u2019s cousin Marvin. I can\u2019t stand that man.\u201d         \n\nYou might think from this I do not get along with my mother. In fact, I consider my mother, who is 86 and in excellent health, to be very entertaining. She is up for everything, fears nothing, and we can talk for hours on our favorite subject, what everybody else in the family is doing wrong with their lives.         \n\nWe also share many interests, for instance, on this trip in Northern California, driving through holes in trees. I doubt there was one \u201cDrive Through the Giant Redwood\u201d stop of which we did not take advantage.         \n\nAs travel mates, however, we have problems, not just because my mother lives in Florida and has come to consider anything over 40 miles an hour speeding, but because of what things cost. My mother, who is one of those brilliant crackpot investors you read about sometimes in magazines, does not have money problems. She travels extensively with tours, some very expensive, but she pays a flat rate for everything. Therefore her idea of motel rates dates to when she and my father drove from the Catskills to Florida \u2014 the late 1940\u2019s, I would estimate, from the price.         \n\nOn our road trip in California, for instance, she was appalled that the historic mountain hotel with potted palms in the lobby charged $140 for a room and carried on until I found a motel for $67 a night in the nearby village. It was the sort of place, in its better days, a meth dealer would have stayed after his parents threw him out of the basement, but once he made a few sales, he would have moved on to something better.         \n\nThe rooms had air-conditioning units hanging off the sides of windows as if they had tried to escape and gotten hung up on the sills, and the mold was sprinkled with carpet. What had transpired on the beds was probably illegal in most states.         \n\n\u201cLooks good to me,\u201d my mother said, stepping in.         \n\n\u201cTell you what, Ma,\u201d I said. \u201cHow about we go back to that nice old hotel and you let me pay for it?\u201d         \n\n\u201cWell, if you want to throw your money away, fine,\u201d Ma says.
