Firewood Splits Norwegians", "body": "\nOSLO \u2014 The TV program, on the topic of firewood, consisted mostly of people in parkas chatting and chopping in the woods and then eight hours of a fire burning in a fireplace. Yet no sooner had it begun, on prime time on Friday night, than the angry responses came pouring in.         \n\n\u201cWe received about 60 text messages from people complaining about the stacking in the program,\u201d said Lars Mytting, whose best-selling book \u201cSolid Wood: All About Chopping, Drying and Stacking Wood \u2014 and the Soul of Wood-Burning\u201d inspired the broadcast. \u201cFifty percent complained that the bark was facing up, and the rest complained that the bark was facing down.\u201d         \n\nHe explained, \u201cOne thing that really divides  \n is bark.\u201d         \n\nOne thing that does not divide Norway, apparently, is its love of discussing Norwegian wood. Nearly a million people, or 20 percent of the population, tuned in at some point to the program, which was shown on the state broadcaster, NRK.         \n\nIn a country where 1.2 million households have fireplaces or wood stoves, said Rune Moeklebust, NRK\u2019s head of programs in the west coast city of Bergen, the subject naturally lends itself to television.         \n\n\u201cMy first thought was, \u2018Well, why not make a TV series about firewood?\u2019\u201d Mr. Moeklebust said in an interview. \u201cAnd that eventually cut down to a 12-hour show, with four hours of ordinary produced television, and then eight hours of showing a fireplace live.\u201d         \n\nThere is no question that it is a popular topic. \u201cSolid Wood\u201d spent more than a year on the nonfiction best-seller list in Norway. Sales so far have exceeded 150,000 copies \u2014 the equivalent, as a percentage of the population, to 9.5 million in the United States \u2014 not far below the figures for E. L. James\u2019s Norwegian hit \u201cFifty Shades Fanget,\u201d proof that thrills come in many forms.         \n\n\u201cNational Firewood Night,\u201d as Friday\u2019s program was called, opened with the host, Rebecca Nedregotten Strand, promising to \u201ctry to get to the core of Norwegian firewood culture \u2014 because firewood is the foundation of our lives.\u201d Various people discussed its historical and personal significance. \u201cWe\u2019ll be sawing, we\u2019ll be splitting, we\u2019ll be stacking and we\u2019ll be burning,\u201d Ms. Nedregotten Strand said.         \n\nBut the real excitement came when the action moved, four hours later, to a fireplace in a Bergen farmhouse.         \n\nPerhaps you have seen a log fire burning on television before. But it would be very foolish to confuse Norway\u2019s eight-hour fireplace extravaganza on Friday with the Yule log broadcast in the United States at Christmastime.         \n\nWhile the Yule log fire plays on a constant repeating loop, the fire on \u201cNational Firewood Night\u201d burned all night long, in suspensefully unscripted configurations. Fresh wood was added through the hours by an NRK photographer named Ingrid Tangstad Hatlevoll, aided by viewers who sent advice via Facebook on where exactly to place it.         \n\nFor most of the time, the only sound came from the fire. Ms. Hatlevoll\u2019s face never appeared on screen, but occasionally her hands could be seen putting logs in the fireplace, or cooking sausages and marshmallows on sticks.         \n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t go to bed because I was so excited,\u201d a viewer called niesa36 said on the Dagbladet newspaper Web site. \u201cWhen will they add new logs? Just before I managed to tear myself away, they must have opened the flue a little, because just then the flames shot a little higher.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not being ironic,\u201d the viewer continued. \u201cFor some reason, this broadcast was very calming and very exciting at the same time.\u201d         \n\nTo be fair, the program was not universally acclaimed. On Twitter, a viewer named Andre Ulveseter said: \u201cWent to throw a log on the fire, got mixed up, and smashed it right into the TV.\u201d         \n\nBut Derek Miller, an expatriate American and author of the novel \u201cNorwegian by Night,\u201d said the broadcast appealed to Norwegians\u2019 nostalgia for a simpler time as well as demonstrating the importance of firewood in their lives. \u201cThe sense of creating warmth, both symbolically and literally, to share conversation, to share food, to share silence, is essential to the Norwegian identity,\u201d he said in an interview.
