{"headline": "For Contractor in Special Ed, Huge Fees and Poor Care", "body": "\nCheon H. Park ran a company that had begun to prosper on government contracts, but he had bigger ambitions. So he tore down his shabby headquarters on a quiet street in Flushing, Queens, and replaced it with a lavish three-story building that had marble floors, granite countertops, red carpets and a soaring chandelier.         \n\nThen he brought in the clients: 3- and 4-year-olds with developmental disabilities.         \n\nScores of them came each weekday, their parents lured by the attractive surroundings and the promises of state-of-the-art therapy. New York City and New York State paid for it all, from the expensive renovations to the services themselves, at a rate of as much as $98 an hour.         \n\nBut many of the children entrusted to Mr. Park\u2019s company did not get the care they needed, according to numerous interviews with workers and parents and an extensive analysis of government records.         \n\nSome children whose first language was Chinese languished in classes taught in Spanish or Korean. Others who were supposed to receive individual tutoring were thrown into groups of four or more children, all with different types of disabilities.         \n\nSome children did not have disabilities at all and were simply being used to generate billings, the interviews show.         \n\n\u201cWe had kids who were little rocket scientists being put in there \u2014 who could read and write at a third-grade level,\u201d said Angel Tirado, a former aide to Mr. Park.         \n\nMr. Park\u2019s contracts were canceled by the city at the beginning of this school year after The New York Times questioned officials about his company.         \n\nBut his success until then underscores how private contractors have taken advantage of this generously financed but poorly regulated segment of the special-education system, often called special ed pre-K, according to an investigation by The Times.         \n\nAt Mr. Park\u2019s company, the costs to treat these 3- and 4-year-olds were enormous. The government routinely spent more than $50,000 in a single year on services for one child, according to an analysis of billing records.         \n\nIn all, that occurred 281 times from 2005 to 2012, the records show.         \n\nThe money went to Mr. Park\u2019s company, Bilingual SEIT, and other providers of related services, including contractors that transported children to his schools.         \n\nIn the 2011-12 school year, Bilingual SEIT billed more than $17 million to the city and state, up from $725,000 it had billed a decade earlier.         \n\nAs his revenue grew, Mr. Park bought a 5,000-square-foot house behind high walls on the North Shore of Long Island, and used city and state funds to buy a Mercedes for his 20-minute commute.         \n\nThe special ed pre-K program provides services for 3- and 4-year olds with developmental disabilities, which include  \n. Some children have difficulty communicating, learning and socializing. They may also have problems with cognitive and motor skills, like picking up objects.         \n\nThe state and its localities together  \n, which has doubled in size over the last decade and is by far the most expensive, per child, in the country.         \n\nIn New York City, annual costs total $1.2 billion, about 6 percent of the $19.8 billion overall education budget. The state and city jointly supervise the program, with the state paying 60 percent of the cost and the city paying the rest.         \n\nThe growth in spending has been prompted in part by more awareness of  \n, but officials acknowledge that services for children with autism account for only some of the increase.         \n\nSupporters of the program said it represented a crucial early investment that pays off in better educational results as children mature.         \n\nThey maintained that fraud was rare but was giving the program a bad name, unfairly raising doubts about the motivations of hundreds of upstanding contractors. And they said measures to crack down on waste and abuse were making it harder for qualified preschoolers to obtain the specialized instruction and treatment they need.         \n\nYet The Times found that a network of contractors has arisen that routinely bill for questionable services.         \n\nThe Times\u2019s investigation drew on interviews with more than 50 former workers at Mr. Park\u2019s company, including teachers, therapists, administrators and clerks. Parents, city and state education officials, state auditors, and executives and workers at other contractors in the industry were also interviewed.         \n\nThe Times analyzed a decade of billing records and financial statements from Mr. Park\u2019s company and many others, and examined thousands of pages of government records.         \n\n \n. Some contractors labeled overseas vacations and spa trips as business travel, or used corporate credit cards for jewelry or groceries.  \n and perks like fancy cars, even as they seldom showed up for work.  \n, claiming he had opened a satellite office there. Another contractor lived out of state herself.         \n\nThe bar to entry was low. One preschool contractor had a previous career in  \n fraud, federal records showed. Another was convicted of weapon possession and workers\u2019 compensation fraud.         \n\nState and city education officials said The Times\u2019s findings were troubling.         \n\n\u201cThis is a program in serious need of reform,\u201d the state education commissioner, John B. King Jr., said. \u201cA few very bad actors are stealing from taxpayers and hurting children.\u201d         \n\nCity officials noted that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg had asked the State Legislature in January to change the program\u2019s rules to rein in costs.
