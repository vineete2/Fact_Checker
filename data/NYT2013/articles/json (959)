{"headline": "Reviving Elaine\u2019s Without Elaine", "body": "\nThe swanky canopy will be out front again at 1703 Second Avenue at 88th Street, braving East River winds with new fabric popping on the original frame. It will be charcoal, not yellow, though. Inside, the walls will be decorated with framed revenants of the room\u2019s high-oxygen heyday. But really. Can there be a new Elaine\u2019s without Elaine?         \n\nAfter two and a half-years \u2014 and much construction tumult \u2014 the Writing Room, a $4-million, 140-seat restaurant, will open in the former spot of one of the nation\u2019s most celebrated A-list hangouts. It was a 48-year-long party, from 1963 until the final nose-dive in 2011, nearly six months after the restaurant\u2019s formidable proprietor,  \n, died at age 81.         \n\nMichael and Susy Glick, who already run a restaurant in the neighborhood, plan to open the Writing Room in the next weeks as a haunt for food, camaraderie and literary ambience. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to capitalize on Elaine\u2019s,\u201d Mrs. Glick said, \u201cbut there is a lot of iconic interest. The legacy is there. We want to pay homage to an amazing space, but also to change it. And give it better food.\u201d         \n\nLegions of former habitu\u00e9s are hardly of one mind about the attempted reanimation. \u201cElaine would be turning in her grave to see what they\u2019re doing in her restaurant,\u201d said Steve Walter, a co-owner of the music club  \n, on East 32nd Street, who was a devotee of Elaine\u2019s for a decade. He lamented the sleekness of the redesign and the disappearance of the tchotchkes and fixtures, like the pendant dining room lights \u201cthat Elaine told me she got from a funeral parlor.\u201d         \n\nOthers were wistful. \u201cThe soul was gone when Elaine was gone,\u201d said Bobby Zarem, the longtime publicist for Elaine\u2019s, who first visited the restaurant three weeks after it opened in 1963 \u201cand never stopped going back,\u201d he said. He  \n now, but added, \u201cI wish them well.\u201d         \n\nDining in New York is a movable feast, and \u201crestaurants have lives, and afterlives, and reclaimed lives,\u201d said the writer Gay Talese, who was a star regular at Elaine\u2019s for more than 40 years. Popular places such as Aquavit, Minetta Tavern and Sparks Steak House have been successfully revived, and in 1999 the society haunt Mortimer\u2019s was reinvented as Swifty\u2019s. But the fate of the much-anticipated reset of Tavern on the Green is still in the wind.         \n\nIn the case of the Writing Room, the future is similarly unclear. \u201cOf course they are capitalizing on the original, but why not?\u201d Mr. Talese said. \u201cIt could help them to make it.\u201d         \n\nWill he be there? \u201cWe expect to go for one visit,\u201d he added, of himself and his wife, the publisher and editor Nan Talese. \u201cBut we don\u2019t expect to have a courtship.\u201d         \n\nElaine\u2019s was always a conundrum. Even at its peak, non-devotees and ex-communicants (not all of them nobodies) viewed it as an overpriced, inbred purveyor of Italian-dominated food that ranged from the decent to the suspect. True zealots saw it as a magic kingdom, an ever-shifting kaleidoscope of revelry that gloriously merited the line of double-parked limos out front.         \n\nEver at the center of the restaurant\u2019s matrix was the mystery of Elaine the saloonkeeper: gorgon, imperious matriarch and hostess with an iron whim \u2014 but possessor of a salty laugh and generous heart that customarily melted in the presence of her in-group.         \n\nA downtown bohemian of humble origins, she was street-savvy, earthy and large, and turned her uptown watering hole into a comic-opera aristocracy of journalists, editors, playwrights, actors, politicians and their moneyed acolytes. Not only did Ms. Kaufman genuinely like writers, but early on, she may have sensed that when one coddles them, one tends to get written about.         \n\nAs a reminder to the Elaine\u2019s-challenged, the guest list over the years included (in alphabetical order): Woody Allen, Robert Altman, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Simone de Beauvoir, Leonard Bernstein, Marlon Brando, Michael Caine, Joan Didion, Clint Eastwood, Nora Ephron, Clay Felker, Jane Fonda, Judy Garland, Pete Hamill, Richard Harris, Joseph Heller, Dustin Hoffman, Mick Jagger, Janis Joplin, Jacqueline Kennedy, John Lennon, Sidney Lumet, Marcello Mastroianni, Norman Mailer, Robert Mitchum, Mike Nichols, Jack Nicholson, Rudolf Nureyev, Peter O\u2019Toole, Nicholas Pileggi, George Plimpton, Mario Puzo, Irwin Shaw, Bobby Short, George Steinbrenner, William Styron, Kurt Vonnegut Jr., Andy Warhol, Harvey Weinstein and Raquel Welch.         \n\nThe new owners thought about calling their place Elaine\u2019s \u201cfor about an hour,\u201d Mr. Glick said. \u201cBut there was only one Elaine.\u201d Therefore, \u201cthe Writing Room, as a name, seemed appropriate,\u201d he added, \u201csince writing \u2014 aside from Elaine herself \u2014 was the most consistent thing at the restaurant.\u201d (It is not to be confused with the Writers Room, a shared literary work space downtown.)
