{"headline": "Unmarried Spouses Have a Way With Words", "body": "\nNOW that we\u2019ve come to some consensus on  \n, let\u2019s move on to the next puzzle: what to call two people who act as if they are married but are not.         \n\n\u201cI went through a phase of just calling him Eric, even to people who didn\u2019t know who that was,\u201d said the master wordsmith Ann Kjellberg, 50, editor of the journal Little Star and the literary executor of the poet Joseph Brodsky. Eric Zerof spent 15 years as her live-in not-spouse and is the father of Ms. Kjellberg\u2019s child. \u201cI kept thinking, \u2018This should not be this hard!\u2019 I was very unhappy about the situation. I could never find a word I liked.\u201d         \n\nOne might imagine we would be less tongue-tied. The faux spouse is a pretty ho-hum cultural specimen for such a gaping verbal lacuna. But none of the word choices are good. Everyone agrees that partner sounds awful \u2014 too anodyne, empty, cold. Lover may be worse \u2014 too sexualized, graphic, one-dimensional. Boyfriend sounds too young. Significant other sounds too \u201980s. Special friend or just friend (both favored by the 65-and-over crowd) are just too ridiculous.         \n\nFaced with such weak English-language options, Janna Cordeiro, 43, a nonprofit and public health consultant in San Francisco, settled on calling Sebastian Toomey, her mate of 23 years, \u201cmi hombre\u201d \u2014 my man. (Pronunciation: deep and forceful, with rolled r, as in a Western.) \u201cMy daughter goes to a Spanish-immersion school,\u201d Ms. Cordeiro explained. \u201cWhen she started kindergarten, I started asking the Spanish-speaking parents how to introduce Seb. Everybody kept saying, \u2018mi esposo, mi esposo.\u2019 I kept saying that was wrong and started saying, \u2018mi hombre,\u2019 and it stuck.\u201d         \n\nAnne Tierney, 32, a bodyworker in West Palm Beach, Fla., went for \u201cfusband,\u201d which, she explains, is a catchall for \u201cfake husband, future husband.\u201d (Ms. Tierney\u2019s fusband, Ozzy, calls Ms. Tierney \u201cwifey.\u201d) Technically the two are engaged, but Ms. Tierney said: \u201cThe word fianc\u00e9 makes me cringe. What am I, in France?\u201d         \n\nThe engagement process, according to Ms. Tierney, was also a bit of a debacle: \u201cI was sitting on the ground. Ozzy was standing up. Little Ozzy\u201d \u2014 their baby, now a toddler \u2014 \u201cwas crying.\u201d Big Ozzy gave Ms. Tierney a necklace. She said she thought, \u201cWhy is this guy giving me a necklace?\u201d Then he gave her a diamond ring that, because they had not planned on marrying, she assumed was fake. (It wasn\u2019t.) The two have not set a wedding date and probably never will. Ms. Tierney said: \u201cIf I ever get the urge, maybe I\u2019ll drag him to a wedding shop and we\u2019ll take a few pictures. If he could just come and stare at me lovingly, that would make me happy.\u201d         \n\nDemographers, tasked with counting the hombres, mujeres and their relationships to one another, are not doing much better than fusband. Until the 1970s, the American faux spouse was too rare and taboo to even try to track. In 1980, the United States Census Bureau made its first attempt at naming these creatures in order to count them. It really outdid itself lexicographically: \u201cperson of opposite sex sharing living quarters,\u201d abbreviated to POSSLQ and pronounced \u201cpossle cue.\u201d The CBS commentator Charles Osgood had his way with the acronym,  \n riffing John Donne\u2019s \u201cThe Bait.\u201d         \n\nYou live with me, and I with you,         \n\nAnd you will be my POSSLQ.         \n\nI\u2019ll be your friend and so much more;         \n\nThat\u2019s what a POSSLQ is for.         \n\nHow, at the dawn of 2013, can the POSSLQ remain a form of love that has a hard time speaking its name? Forty-four percent of American adults are unmarried. Seven million Americans live with a paramour who is not a spouse. The median age of those marrying for the first time is rising. The percentage of children born out of wedlock (an atrocious term itself) is rising as well.         \n\nIn his book \u201cThe Marriage-Go-Round,\u201d Andrew Cherlin, a professor of sociology and public policy at Johns Hopkins University, details the dizzying, perhaps even nauseating, American way of marriage. We marry, unmarry and remarry again more quickly than the citizens of any other Western nation. What this means, Mr. Cherlin wrote, \u201cis that family life in the United States involves more transitions than anywhere else.\u201d Transitions are the hard part. Little wonder many people want to stop the marriage carousel and get off.         \n\nFor many POSSLQs, being unmarried is as much a psychological state as a legal one. Joan Linder, 42, an artist and associate professor of visual studies at the University at Buffalo, lives with the man she winkingly calls her baby daddy. They have been together for seven years, share a house and a mortgage, and have two kids. \u201cWe behave a lot like a nuclear family,\u201d Ms. Linder said. But her baby daddy \u2014 Paul Vanouse, 45, also an artist and professor in her department \u2014 is definitely not her husband, nor does she want him to be. Being unmarried makes her feel good. Ms. Linder said, \u201cIt\u2019s the last stage of connection to rebellion, punk rock, countercultural \u2014 all those pieces of my youth.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/fashion/unmarried-spouses-have-a-way-with-words.html", "date": "2013-01-04", "description": "We still can\u2019t seem to figure out what to call two people who act as if they are married but are not.
