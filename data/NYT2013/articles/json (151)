{"headline": "Museums Confront the Skeletons in Their Closets", "body": "\nBERLIN \u2014 Rows of gaptoothed human skulls and formaldehyde-soaked brains stock the Museum of Medical History here, where the popular exhibition \u201cBeneath the Skin\u201d can be so grim that visitors will occasionally swoon to the cold stone floor.         \n\nFor more than a century, the museum has exhibited assorted limbs, bones, tubercular lungs and fetuses, all in the name of science and enlightenment. Yet lately the curators are re-evaluating the principles that govern their displays as they confront a growing debate over what cultural organizations should be doing to preserve the dignity of the dead.         \n\nMany of the world\u2019s grand museums are hearing increasing demands for the return of human remains from former colonies or conquered peoples. Some are giving back bones and skulls that were once viewed as exotic trinkets and were traded by native peoples for calico or plundered in the late 1800s by scientists exploring racial differences.         \n\nLate last month the medical museum and officials who direct the anatomy collection of a sister organization at the Charit\u00e9 Hospital in Berlin, returned 33 skulls and skeletons to Australia and to members of tribes from the Torres Strait Islands between northern Australia and Papua New Guinea.         \n\nThe handover took place in a simple ceremony in a lecture hall at the Charit\u00e9. Gray cardboard boxes of remains were draped in white and aboriginal flags.         \n\n\u201cThese are very moving moments for indigenous people around the world,\u201d said Ned David, a Torres Strait islander who helps lead a repatriation group and attended the Berlin ceremony. \u201cThey are bringing their ancestral remains home. There are mixed emotions, one obviously of relief, so it\u2019s a celebration. And then the moment is tinged with sadness for what was involved with the removal of the remains.\u201d         \n\nThat same week the German Museums Association issued new ethical guidelines for museums on how to handle human remains in the face of repatriation claims from former colonies where scientists gathered skulls and skeletons under murky circumstances more than a century ago.         \n\nIn a 70-page report, sprinkled with references to Kant\u2019s concept of human dignity, a commission of lawyers and curators recommended that institutions study provenance systematically and return remains that had been collected as part of a violent conflict. They urged each individual museum to develop a policy and concluded that \u201cthere is no simple answer that can be applied equally to all collections.\u201d         \n\nIn many ways, the German association is drawing on the experiences of museums in Britain and the United States, which started facing claims for the repatriation of human remains decades ago. The Smithsonian began to repatriate American Indian bones in the late 1980s, and in 1990 the United States passed legislation to enforce the return of those remains by museums that benefit from federal funds. The Smithsonian independently returned remains to Australia in 2008 and 2010.         \n\nHowever, a report in 2011 from the Government Accountability Office still urged new measures to speed up the Smithsonian\u2019s work, because by then it had returned only 5,000 remains, about one-third of its collection of such material.         \n\nHuman remains are held by many of the world\u2019s museums, most typically those exploring natural history, science, medicine and archaeology.         \n\nCollecting such remains in pursuit of scientific knowledge once went unchallenged, but now institutions face the quandary of how to display Egyptian mummies in a respectful fashion. What is the purpose of displaying shrunken heads or tattooed Maori skulls or bone flutes? And should curators return remains that have been transformed into works of folk art?         \n\nIn England, the Manchester Museum just issued a six-page statement of its guidelines for its natural history collection that pledges transparency and \u201crespect\u201d for human remains. It is looking to transform old exhibitions to reflect new attitudes by, for example, offering more information about the lives of people preserved as mummies, so they can be viewed as individuals instead of specimens.
