{"headline": "Santiago Calatrava Collects Critics as Well as Fans", "body": "\nVALENCIA, Spain \u2014 For a while, this sprawling Mediterranean city embraced Santiago Calatrava\u2019s architecture with gusto. In a dried-up riverbed, Mr. Calatrava built and built, eventually filling 86 acres with his radical, and some say awe-inspiring, designs.         \n\nBut these days, even as Mr. Calatrava\u2019s eye-catching PATH station creeps toward completion in Lower Manhattan, he is often cast as a villain here in Valencia. One local politician runs a Web site called  \n, which loosely translates as, \u201cCalatrava bleeds you dry.\u201d         \n\nOriginally budgeted at 300 million euros (about $405 million), the riverbed complex, called the City of Arts and Sciences \u2014 the world\u2019s largest collection of Mr. Calatrava\u2019s work, which includes a performance hall, a bridge, a planetarium, an opera house, a science museum, a covered walkway and acres of reflecting pools \u2014 has cost nearly three times that much, money the region never had.         \n\nIgnacio Blanco, the member of the provincial Parliament who started the Web site, has unleashed a flood of information about the complex during the past year, concluding that Valencia still owes 700 million euros (about $944 million) on it.         \n\nMr. Calatrava was paid approximately 94 million euros (about $127 million) for his work. How could that be, Mr. Blanco asks, when the opera house included 150 seats with obstructed views? Or when the science museum was initially built without fire escapes or elevators for the disabled?         \n\n\u201cHow can you make mistakes like that?\u201d asked Mr. Blanco, a member of the small opposition United Left party here, who said millions were spent to fix such errors. \u201cHe was paid even when repairing his own mistakes.\u201d         \n\nAlong with Frank Gehry, Richard Meier, Renzo Piano and Norman Foster, Mr. Calatrava swept to prominence in an era of showstopping architecture. Across the globe, he has designed dozens of structures, almost invariably white, including the Li\u00e8ge-Guillemins railway station in Belgium; the  \n skyscraper in Malmo, Sweden; and the Milwaukee Art Museum, with its mechanical roof.         \n\n \n         \n\nAdmirers say that Mr. Calatrava\u2019s designs are both delicate and powerful. They liken his buildings to giant sculptures and praise his stubborn devotion to form. And they point out that star architects often come with hefty price tags, partly because their designs frequently call for intricate, complicated construction. Almost all have at least one project that seemed to spin horribly out of control \u2014 and it is rarely easy to determine exactly who might be at fault and for what.         \n\nBut in numerous interviews, other architects, academics and builders say that Mr. Calatrava is amassing an unusually long list of projects marred by cost overruns, delays and litigation. It is hard to find a Calatrava project that has not been significantly over budget. And complaints abound that he is indifferent to the needs of his clients. Just last month a Dutch councilor in Haarlemmermeer, near Amsterdam, urged his colleagues to take legal action because the three bridges the architect designed for the town cost twice the budgeted amount and then millions more in upkeep since they opened in 2004. Mr. Calatrava is already in court over a footbridge in Venice, a winery in the \u00c1lava region of Spain and a massive exhibition and conference center in Oviedo, Spain.         \n\nIn Bilbao, Spain, there have been problems with a bridge and an airport.         \n\n\u201cWhat you see over and over again is that rather than searching for functionality or customer satisfaction, he aims for singularity,\u201d said Jes\u00fas Ca\u00f1ada Merino, the president of Bilbao\u2019s architects\u2019 association. \u201cThe problem is that Calatrava is above and beyond the client.\u201d         \n\nMr. Calatrava is likely to come under renewed scrutiny in New York as building continues on one of his latest projects, the new PATH train station at ground zero. It is expected to open in 2015 but is six years behind schedule and will cost $4 billion, twice the original budget.         \n\nCritics of the project, commissioned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, find the final price tag hard to believe. (In January 2012 an independent audit of the Port Authority concluded that the agency was \u201ca challenged and dysfunctional organization.\u201d) But several executives who have been involved in construction at the World Trade Center site, who did not want to speak on the record because of their relationship with the project, said Mr. Calatrava\u2019s designs were problematic, too, calling for hugely difficult construction, including a vast underground chamber. In addition, they said, he demanded that surrounding buildings house all the station\u2019s mechanical elements, like ventilation, which complicated construction and called for time-consuming coordination.
