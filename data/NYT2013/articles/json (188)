Young Iraqi scholars at a Shiite Muslim seminary volunteer to fight Sunnis in Syria. Far to the west, in Lebanon, clashes have worsened between opposing sects in the northern city of Tripoli.         \n\nIn Syria itself, \u201cShiites have become a main target,\u201d said Malek, an opposition activist who did not want his last name published because of safety concerns. He was visiting Lebanon from a rebel-held Syrian town, Qusayr, where his brother died Tuesday battling Shiite guerrillas from the Lebanese militia Hezbollah. \u201cPeople lost brothers, sons, and they\u2019re angry,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe Syrian civil war is setting off a contagious sectarian conflict beyond the country\u2019s borders, reigniting long-simmering tensions between Sunnis and Shiites, and, experts fear, shaking the foundations of countries cobbled together after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire.         \n\nFor months, the fighting in Syria has spilled across its borders as rockets landed in neighboring countries or skirmishes crossed into their territories. But now, the Syrian war, with more than 80,000 dead, is inciting Sunnis and Shiites in other countries to attack one another.         \n\n\u201cNothing has helped make the Sunni-Shia narrative stick on a popular level more than the images of Assad \u2014 with Iranian help \u2014 butchering Sunnis in Syria,\u201d said  \n, a regional analyst and president of the National Iranian American Council, referring to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. \u201cIran and Assad may win the military battle, but only at the expense of cementing decades of ethnic discord.\u201d         \n\nThe Syrian uprising began as peaceful protests against Mr. Assad and transformed over two years into a bloody battle of attrition. But the killing is no longer just about supporting or opposing the government, or even about Syria. Some Shiites are pouring into Syria out of a sense of religious duty. In Iraq, random attacks on Sunni mosques and neighborhoods that had subsided in recent years have resumed \u2014  \n \u2014 as Sunni militias fight the army.         \n\nWith Sunni-led Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey backing the uprising against Mr. Assad, who is supported by Shiite Iran and Hezbollah, sectarian divisions simmering since the American invasion of Iraq are spreading through a region already upended by the Arab uprisings.         \n\nThe Syrian war fuels, and is fueled by, broader antagonisms that are primarily rooted not in sect but in clashing geopolitical and strategic interests: the regional power struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran; Iran\u2019s confrontation with the West over its nuclear program; and  \n of Mr. Assad against American-backed Israel.         \n\nBut sectarian feeling has seeped in. Iraq has been especially vulnerable. With the Sunni majority in Syria battling to overthrow a government dominated by Mr. Assad\u2019s Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiism, some in Iraq\u2019s Sunni minority grew emboldened by the prospect of overthrowing their own Shiite government.         \n\nToday, many Iraqis feel they are on the road back to the dark days of 2006 and \u201907, the peak of sectarian militia massacres by Shiites ascendant after years of oppression under Saddam Hussein, and by minority Sunnis disempowered by his fall.         \n\nWhile the 2007 American troop surge helped to limit the bloodshed, random attacks against Shiites never stopped. What was different was that the Shiites, who finally felt firmly in control of the security forces, stopped retaliating. But that seems to be changing.         \n\nSunni militias have risen up to fight the army, and for the first time in years Sunni mosques and neighborhoods are being regularly targeted. The first notable attack was in April, at a cafe in the Sunni neighborhood of Amariya; it started late at night as young men played pool, and it left dozens of people dead. While it is unclear who is responsible for the new violence, many Sunnis blame the government, or Iranian-backed Shiite militias.         \n\nIn Lebanon, perennial clashes between Alawite and Sunni militias in Tripoli have reached their worst level in years as each side blames the other for carnage in Syria.         \n\nIn Syria, both the government and its opponents insist that their civil war is not a fight between religious sects. Rebel leaders say their only aim is to depose a dictator. Mr. Assad says he is fending off extremist terrorists, and he is careful not to frame the conflict as a fight against the country\u2019s Sunni majority, which he praises for its moderation.         \n\nMr. Assad\u2019s affinity with Hezbollah and Iran is primarily strategic. Though his Alawite sect, about 12 percent of the population, provides bedrock support, most Alawites are secular. Syria\u2019s fewer than 200,000 mainstream Shiites are a much smaller minority, less than 1 percent.
