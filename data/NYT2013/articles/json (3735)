{"headline": "Marriage Licenses for Same-Sex Couples Force Issue to Fore in New Mexico", "body": "\nALBUQUERQUE \u2014 The decision by clerks in six of New Mexico\u2019s most populous counties to start issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples has added a sense of urgency to a fight that some of the state\u2019s top political leaders had seemed in no hurry to join.         \n\n\u201cIt is time someone makes a decision that settles this debate,\u201d said  \n, the clerk in Bernalillo County, where about a dozen same-sex couples were married during a group ceremony outside the county building here last Tuesday.         \n\nFor years, state legislators have tried to settle the debate, with conservative Republicans introducing bills to describe marriage as a union between a man and a woman and liberal Democrats stalling those efforts or proposing bills of their own without gender-specific restrictions. None ever succeeded.         \n\nThat has left New Mexico as the only state in the country that has no statute or constitutional amendment explicitly barring same-sex couples from marrying, but also no law saying they can. Since March, same-sex couples in three cities \u2014 Santa Fe, Albuquerque and Los Alamos \u2014 have filed lawsuits in an effort to get a clear ruling on the issue.         \n\nGov. Susana Martinez, a Republican, has kept a dispassionate distance, affirming her personal opposition to  \n but saying the decision should be left to voters. In June, Gary King, the state\u2019s attorney general and a Democrat, punted,  \n he was not going to take a public stance on the issue. More recently, he has said he would not challenge any county clerk who decided to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.         \n\nBut as the time passed and the uncertainty lingered, some county clerks took matters into their own hands.         \n\nThe first among them,  \n of Do\u00f1a Ana County \u2014 where Governor Martinez began her political career \u2014 said he was tired of waiting when,  \n, he began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples from his office in Las Cruces, an increasingly liberal city in the largely conservative southern part of the state. Five other county clerks followed, though not until a court order gave them justification and permission, a move that also served to limit the legal options available to stop them.         \n\n \n, which was issued Aug. 26 by an Albuquerque judge, Alan M. Malott, established that \u201cimplying conditions of sexual orientation on one\u2019s right to enter civil contracts such as marriage\u201d was a violation of the equal-protection clause in the state\u2019s Constitution.         \n\n \n, a Republican state senator from Farmington, in northern New Mexico, and the loudest voice of opposition, said that the court order \u201ccomplicates things,\u201d and he characterized the clerks\u2019 moves as \u201cpure lawlessness.\u201d Still, late on Friday, Mr. Sharer sued Mr. Ellins to stop him from granting any more marriage licenses.         \n\n \n, a Republican state representative from Las Cruces \u2014 who had considered joining Mr. Sharer\u2019s lawsuit, but backed away because, he said, he was ultimately not opposed to same-sex marriage \u2014 conceded in an interview that marriage equality in New Mexico was \u201can inevitability.\u201d         \n\nThe clerks have shifted their focus to the state\u2019s Supreme Court. They are joining one of the lawsuits filed by same-sex couples so they can appeal Judge Malott\u2019s ruling, which is limited to Bernalillo and Santa Fe Counties, both defendants in the lawsuit, and try to force a statewide resolution.         \n\nFor their part, elected officials from both parties are contemplating the political price they may have to pay for their stance on same-sex marriage.         \n\nThe state\u2019s Democratic Party has worked hard to take ownership of the issue, using it to bolster its narrative of New Mexico\u2019s gradual tilt to the left on social issues. In an interview, the party\u2019s chairman, Sam Bregman, noted the lack of protests after clerks began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples in San Miguel County, home to many Roman Catholic Hispanic families, and Valencia County, where evangelical churches have recently multiplied. (The Valencia County clerk,  \n, is the sole Republican among the clerks issuing the licenses. She won her election in 2012 by 26 votes.)         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to prove that the Republican Party here in New Mexico is on the wrong side of history,\u201d Mr. Bregman said.         \n\nPolitical observers here acknowledged that the position is a bit of a gamble \u2014 but also that risks exist for all sides.         \n\nRepublicans need conservative Democratic voters to win statewide office, which could help explain Governor Martinez\u2019s reluctance to publicly engage in the debate over same-sex marriage \u2014 and also Mr. King\u2019s noncommittal stance. He is regarded as a leading contender for the Democratic nomination for governor, which means that he would be vying for support from the same group of constituents, the state\u2019s most reliable set of swing voters, in a general election.         \n\nSilence, however, might also antagonize both parties\u2019 bases.         \n\nBrian Sanderoff, a New Mexico pollster, said evangelical megachurches in Albuquerque, for example, could successfully mobilize opposition in primary races against Republican candidates who did not speak strongly against same-sex marriage.         \n\nWhat most people are hoping for is a definitive ruling from the state\u2019s Supreme Court, but the outcome also has its wrinkles. If the court legalizes same-sex marriage, conservative legislators might push for a ballot question to give voters the ultimate say. But if there is a ballot question, liberal and progressive voters would most likely mobilize in droves, posing a challenge for Governor Martinez, who is up for re-election next year.         \n\n\u201cThe last thing the governor wants is a bunch of liberal, young voters going to the polls,\u201d Mr. Sanderoff said.         \n\nThey have already proved they are able to organize quickly and cheaply. Pat Davis, executive director of  \n, an advocacy group, said the mass wedding ceremony outside the county building here came together in less than 24 hours and cost $50, mostly because so many of the organizers volunteered their time and labor.         \n\nOne of the group\u2019s interns asked college friends to design fliers, and then they each pitched in to pay for printing them. Flower shops offered discounted rates for arrangements that adorned a makeshift podium Mr. Davis had kept from another event and transported in his car.         \n\nAbout 200 people gathered for the wedding, including Ms. Toulouse Oliver, the Bernalillo County clerk, who took a rainbow-color rose to her office afterward, a souvenir to mark the record 136 marriage licenses \u2014 130 of them for same-sex couples \u2014 that her office issued that day.
