{"headline": "An American Man\u2019s Quest to Become an Old Castilian", "body": "\nThe A-1 national highway in Spain heads north from Madrid straight over the Guadarrama Mountains, the peaks jutting like jagged shark teeth that cut the rest of the world away. And then you\u2019re floating, up through one last ear-popping  \n, or pass, perched above the upper Meseta Central, the football-shaped highlands that cover most of the country\u2019s northern interior, the silted land below glinting with flecks of red, gold and green.         \n\nIn that moment, you\u2019re no longer American, or anything at all. It wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see the entire flow of history illuminate that stage: megaraptors skittering after prey; savage packs of prehumans hoarding meat; the Romans building their roads across Hispania, and the Visigoths plotting and conniving; and, after them, the marauding Moors and marauding Christians, pillaging in the name of Allah, God or chivalry; and then the huge, undulating flocks of sheep, whose wool became a source of Spain\u2019s wealth in the 15th and 16th centuries, spurring the grand imperialistic designs of Isabella and Ferdinand that brought the first caravels to the New World . . . and so on.         \n\nHarsh and given to extreme weather, the meseta of Castile isn\u2019t exactly Tuscany or Provence. It doesn\u2019t welcome a traveler with the same fecundity and open arms. From a tourist\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s a little like visiting South Dakota. You can drive miles on the meseta wondering if you\u2019ve landed on the most lonesome patch of flash-baked clay in the world \u2014 past an abandoned car in a field, past a single tree in an ocean of nothingness \u2014 and then from a far hill comes the outline of a church tower, the silhouette of a castle (the reason that this land is called Castile), the clustered homes packed tightly together against what the wild night might bring.         \n\nOn my first visit to the area more than a decade ago, I spun off the highway at Aranda de Duero and headed northwest through vineyards and sunflower fields, looking for a village I\u2019d only heard about \u2014 a place called Guzm\u00e1n (population: 80). I asked for directions in one small town from a group of old men wearing black berets on a shaded bench, then proceeded lost for half an hour, eventually cloverleafing back to that same exact spot. Finally, I found a thin serpentine road that narrowed as I drove, leading upward again.         \n\nAnd suddenly: tiny Guzm\u00e1n on its hill, its skyline a cubist jumble but for the bell tower of the church and the square turrets of the  \nas the 17th-century manor house is known. Some of the houses were so decrepit they appeared split open, as if by the fist of a giant. You could see a strewn book, someone\u2019s bloomers, artifacts of a lost life. Let there be no doubt, time had had its way here. You might have looked upon this place \u2014 and its detritus \u2014 and moved right along.         \n\nBut something happened to me. Even now, I\u2019m not exactly sure what. I have a friend who once told me about the first time he ever took a ferry to an island off the coast of North Carolina, and how he knew, right there on the ferry \u2014 with the salt spray and the light off the ocean \u2014 that he\u2019d come back to this same spot every year. He\u2019d come to relive that feeling of leaving his old self behind. That annual renewal, the reacquaintance with the person he felt himself to be on that island, was something he wanted to organize his life around. Similarly, Guzm\u00e1n instantly and improbably became  \n. It made no sense, practically speaking. Even if I didn\u2019t live 3,000 miles away, or if I spoke Spanish, or didn\u2019t have a baby at home, it wouldn\u2019t have made sense. And that was part of its tug too. I was certain this town had secrets to tell \u2014 and that maybe my best self was there to be found. Sometimes, travel is this elemental: the desire to replace the old molecules with new ones, familiarity with its opposite. To find the kingdom on the hill and stand in awe in its gold-paved streets, even if those streets are strewn, as Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s were, with sheep poo.         \n\n \n reading this on a beach right now. Or in a cabin in the woods. You may be visiting at a friend\u2019s cottage. Or you\u2019ve just returned from Montauk, the Adirondacks, Tuscany. Maybe you\u2019re packing to go, checking a list (bathing suits, fishing rods, novels), waiting to board a plane, anticipating what has been a year in the offing: your summer vacation.         \n\nIt\u2019s possible you\u2019ve found your \u201cplace,\u201d too, the one to which you return, however temporarily, however near or far. When I was a kid, my family made an annual August pilgrimage to Cape Cod, where we rented a cottage in a little colony that brought the same families back each year. For that week, sometimes two, my father didn\u2019t commute or wear a suit and tie to his job, didn\u2019t wash the cars or regrout the shower on weekends, or sit at his desk on Sunday afternoon, paying bills, listening to opera. My mother didn\u2019t have to pack lunches or crisscross the county with her four sons, ferrying us to practices and music lessons and school events.
