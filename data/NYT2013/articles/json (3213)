The men were all square-jawed and broad-shouldered, and the women to the last of them traffic-stopping beauties.         \n\nFinding attractive cabin crews has never posed much of a problem for Aeroflot. Training Russians to be nice to customers, well, there\u2019s the rub for the Russian airline and many other Russian businesses. But Aeroflot seems to have done it.         \n\nAeroflot, which says its classic Soviet emblem of a winged hammer and sickle now represents a smile, has been at the forefront of a broad and transformative trend in the Russian service industry brought about by the rising demands of middle-class consumers.         \n\nSkytrax, a company in Britain that surveys passengers after flights,  \n had the best service of any airline in Eastern Europe this year, a mini Velvet Revolution for a region accustomed to old ideas of Russian service.         \n\nAeroflot beat American carriers like Delta and airlines offering old-school European service like Austrian Airlines.         \n\n\u201cAnna, you just showed the champagne bottle but didn\u2019t say anything,\u201d one instructor gently admonished a trainee, 23-year-old Anna Grishina.         \n\n\u201cThis is the silent service of Soviet times,\u201d the instructor went on. \u201cYou need to talk to her,\u201d she said, indicating a fellow student posing as a passenger. \u201cAnd you need to smile and smile and smile.\u201d         \n\nGone are the scowls, the cold shoulders and the wordless encounters. Aeroflot introduced training that included compelling candidates to memorize dialogues of pleasantries and reinforcing rules on smiling. Its success in improving service is being taken to heart by other companies in Russia\u2019s consumer industries.         \n\nAirlines, restaurant chains and coffee shops are putting in place ever more elaborate service training that is yielding results; a new generation of Russian flight attendants, shop assistants and waitresses has become \u2014 amazingly, given this country\u2019s sour attitude to friendly service for so many years \u2014 customer-oriented.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really hot topic in Russian companies,\u201d said Alex Sukharevsky, a partner and leader of the consumer goods practice in the former Soviet Union for McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm, which has a booming business here advising retail companies.         \n\nThe trend is one sign, along with the demands for better governance seen in recent street protests, of how a decade of oil money trickling down is transforming Russian society. In politics as in business, rising wealth has given birth to rising demands from an expanding middle class.         \n\n\u201cAll of us know that Russian culture by definition is not the most client-oriented culture,\u201d said Mr. Sukharevsky, a specialist on Russian customer service. He has taken a number of companies here through what he calls the \u201cconsumer experience transformation.\u201d         \n\nRussian service employees, it appears, can be trained to be nice. Rosinter, which operates T.G.I. Friday\u2019s restaurants and Costa Coffee shops in Russia, has a training academy that focuses on customer service, as does Dixy, a grocery store chain. The national retail bank, Sberbank, has set about retraining 210,000 tellers to become \u201ccustomer service specialists.\u201d         \n\nBaristas at Starbucks in Russia smile as brightly as anywhere else. McDonald\u2019s internal training for managers in Russia follows a global curriculum, but it puts special emphasis here on \u201ccommunication skills\u201d and a course called \u201cemotional leadership,\u201d said Oksana Belaychuk, the company\u2019s spokeswoman.         \n\nWith these lessons drilled in, at a McDonald\u2019s in Russia it is more common than not to find a line of smiling employees, decked out in pressed shirts, all calling out cheerily to serve the next customer.         \n\n\u201cHello, I\u2019m listening to you,\u201d a young counterman with the name tag Sergei said on a recent evening, using this polite Russian expression that is akin to \u201cHow may I serve you?\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/02/business/international/russian-service-and-with-please-and-thank-you.html", "date": "2013-11-01", "description": "Russian companies are carrying out elaborate training that is producing a new generation of service employees who are customer-oriented."}
