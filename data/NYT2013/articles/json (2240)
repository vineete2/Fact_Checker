{"headline": "McIlroy Walks Out as Concern Creeps In", "body": "\nPALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. \u2014 Applause drowned out the pulsating music Tuesday night as Rory McIlroy made his way to the X taped to the carpet in the resort ballroom. McIlroy, wearing jeans, a dress shirt and pointy-toed shoes, had just been introduced as the first global brand ambassador for Bose, an audio equipment company.         \n\nIt was a timely merger of man and machine. If anybody needed noise-canceling headphones to tune out the world, it was McIlroy, whose slow start in 2013 has generated criticism on both sides of the Atlantic.         \n\nOn Friday he set more tongues lashing by abruptly withdrawing from the Honda Classic after completing eight holes of his second round. It was the first time in 55 starts as a professional on the PGA Tour that he withdrew during a tournament.         \n\nMcIlroy returned this week to PGA National Resort and Spa seeking to become the 41-year-old tournament\u2019s only back-to-back champion besides Jack Nicklaus. Instead, the event led to his latest disappointment since he made the highly lucrative but risky move of changing his equipment from Titleist to Nike at the beginning of the year.         \n\nThe early returns have not been promising: he missed the cut in Abu Dhabi in his season debut, switching to his old putter in the second round, and  \n last week in a World Golf Championships match-play event outside Tucson.         \n\nThe week of his title defense began with McIlroy brushing off criticism in the news media in the United States and the United Kingdom over his equipment change. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m pushing for answers or I\u2019m looking for answers,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything\u2019s there. It\u2019s just a matter of putting it all together.\u201d\u00a0         \n\nAsked if reporters were making too much of it, he laughed and said: \u201cOf course. Like yous always do with everything.\u201d         \n\nMcIlroy was not laughing Friday when he walked off the course after depositing his second shot on his ninth hole, the par-5 18th, into the water. It was his third wet ball of the day, and he stood at seven over after eight holes.         \n\nHe left the grounds without offering an explanation, the first indication that the intense scrutiny that goes hand-in-hand with being golf\u2019s global brand ambassador is darkening McIlroy\u2019s sunny disposition.         \n\nErnie Els and Mark Wilson, who were paired with McIlroy, were unaware of any physical distress that would have prompted him to retire from the tournament. McIlroy gave no hint of a problem before his round, posting on his Twitter account Thursday night  \n for his mother, Rosie.         \n\nAn hour after his withdrawal, in a statement released by his managers, McIlroy said he was bothered by a sore wisdom tooth that did not respond to a pain reliever.         \n\n\u201cIt was very painful again this morning, and I was simply unable to concentrate,\u201d he said.         \n\nMcIlroy added, \u201cThis is one of my favorite tournaments of the year and I regret having to make the decision to withdraw, but it was one I had to make.\u201d         \n\nThere is no manual for the care and maintenance of a global brand, as evidenced by the awkward handling of McIlroy\u2019s withdrawal. Since ascending to No. 1 with his win here last year, McIlroy has tailored his tournament schedule to give himself time to recharge; hired Michael Bannon, his longtime coach and a club pro, to work with him full time; and relocated to Palm Beach County, Fla., where the sun shines brightly but the spotlight is not quite as hot.         \n\nMcIlroy, who bought a multimillion-dollar home in a gated community five miles from PGA National Resort and Spa, said the local populace largely left him alone.         \n\n\u201cPalm Beach is a bit like that,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone is wealthy in their own right, and they think they\u2019re important, and they\u2019re caught up in what they\u2019re doing.\u201d         \n\nMcIlroy\u2019s Nike deal is worth tens of millions of dollars, but nobody who has spent time around him believes that was his motivating factor in making the switch.         \n\n\u201cI truly believe he didn\u2019t leave Titleist for any money reasons,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cHe just wants to be with a company that represents some of the best athletes in a lot of sports.\u201d         \n\nThe job of handling a golfer aligned with the best athletes on the planet falls mainly to Conor Ridge and Colin Morrissey, who founded Horizon Sports Management, the Dublin-based company that has represented McIlroy since 2011. To lessen his learning curve, Ridge said, he sought out people who had guided the careers of some of the world\u2019s most popular entertainers and sportsmen. Among them was a fellow Dubliner, Paul McGuinness, the longtime manager of U2, who told him, essentially, to never forget that performance is the engine that should drive any marketing campaign.
