{"headline": "My Grandfather Invented the Reuben Sandwich. Right?", "body": "\nEvery family has a claim to fame. A friend\u2019s great-grandfather (times 16) was king of Poland for a day in 1586, according to family lore. My neighbor claims he\u2019s related to the man who punched Houdini in the stomach, which may have killed him. My grandfather invented the Reuben sandwich. I\u2019ve had some doubts since seeing the movie \u201cQuiz Show\u201d in 1994, but it\u2019s what I choose to believe.         \n\nThe official family story is this: My great-grandfather had a chain of hotels, and he also had four sons. He decided to train each son in an aspect of the business, so, in 1927, when my grandfather Bernard Schimmel was 18, his father sent him to the \u00c9cole H\u00f4teli\u00e8re in Lausanne, Switzerland, to learn to be a chef. A year later Bernard returned and started working at the Blackstone Hotel, in Omaha, Neb., where his father played poker every Sunday night.         \n\nOut of each pot, my great-grandfather and his card mates set aside a nickel or a dime to order what they called \u201ca midnight lunch\u201d from room service. One night one of the players, Reuben Kulakofsky, who owned a grocery store that has gone down in family lore as the Zabar\u2019s of Omaha in the 1920s, asked for a sandwich with corned beef and sauerkraut. In the kitchen, my grandfather, who spent the previous year perfecting his sauces and ice-carving skills, drained the sauerkraut and mixed it with Thousand Island dressing. He layered that with homemade corned beef and Swiss cheese on dark rye bread and grilled it. His typewritten notes call for the sandwich to be served with a sliced kosher dill pickle, a rose radish and potato chips. The sandwich was a hit.         \n\nBernard\u2019s father put the Reuben sandwich on the Blackstone Hotel\u2019s coffee-shop menu, and then all the coffee-shop menus of all the hotels in the chain. Then in 1956, Fern Snider, a waitress from one of the hotels, entered the Reuben in the National Sandwich Idea Contest, and it won. My grandfather published a recipe for \u201cthe Schimmel Reuben Sandwich\u201d in his otherwise fussy continental cookbook, the recipe sharing a page with his take on \u201cCharcoal-Broiled Butterflied Leg of Lamb, Proven\u00e7ale.\u201d         \n\nWe ate Reubens at family reunions. Occasionally I would brag about my grandfather and the Reuben and then try to make up for it by asking people about their family histories. I learned that a college classmate was the great-granddaughter of Buffalo Bill\u2019s best friend. An editor I knew was the grandniece of the man who helped invent the pop-up turkey thermometer.         \n\nI always assumed that my own family\u2019s story was true. Sure, Reuben\u2019s Restaurant, on 58th Street in New York, also claimed the sandwich. (It is now closed.) Still, the restaurant\u2019s story, involving an unlikely encounter with Charlie Chaplin\u2019s leading lady, never haunted me much. Their recipe includes ham, turkey and coleslaw. Enough said.         \n\nThen \u201cQuiz Show\u201d came out. In the movie, a lawyer who suspects the television game show is rigged asks one of the contestants a question over lunch: Who invented the Reuben sandwich?         \n\nThe answer in the film: Reuben Kay. What?         \n\nI did some digging. I learned the name \u201cKay\u201d mistakenly entered the story after Craig Claiborne used the truncated surname in The New York Times in 1976.         \n\nBut what of Kulakofsky? Should the customer be credited with the sandwich? I\u2019ve been thinking about this for years. He did ask the kitchen for sauerkraut and corned beef, but I think we can all agree that sauerkraut with corned beef is not what anybody would call a bold idea, at least in a good way. The combination sounds kind of gross. The parts attributable to my grandfather would seem to make matters worse. Dark rye bread? Thousand Island dressing? As my friend Roman Mars, who marks his transition from boyhood to manhood by the date he learned to love the Reuben (and whose grandfather might have sold Elvis his first guitar), said, \u201cIf someone served me a salad with Thousand Island dressing, I\u2019d send it back.\u201d         \n\nThe magic of the Reuben is the mix, in the hungry mind of an ambitious son fixing midnight lunch for his father\u2019s poker-playing friends. If\u00a0Kulakofsky had slapped together his own sandwich, would the Reuben have won a contest and entered history? No way, Mars reassured me. \u201cIt had to emerge fully formed, like the armored Athena coming from Zeus\u2019s head.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/09/magazine/my-grandfather-invented-the-reuben-sandwich-right.html", "date": "2013-06-07", "description": "Every family has a claim to fame.
