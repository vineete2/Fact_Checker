But to some policy makers practiced in the art of compromise, it represented a potential missed opportunity.         \n\nA Senate where 51 votes rule \u2014 not the filibuster-proof 60 \u2014 may well have empowered the political center to force compromise, taking power from the political poles, and especially from the party leadership, and returning it to potential deal makers.         \n\n\u201cWith 51 votes, the majority party might just herd their people together to get whatever they want,\u201d said Joseph I. Lieberman, a former senator from Connecticut who turned independent from Democrat. \u201cBut there is another dynamic. It empowers small groups of people to affect the outcome.\u201d         \n\nMr. Lieberman, a veteran of the centrist groups that occasionally spring up to bridge the partisan gap, cautioned that it was difficult to predict what limiting the filibuster would do to the political landscape of the Senate.         \n\nThere do appear to be new stirrings of cooperation \u2014 or at least the desire to cooperate. On Thursday, the staunchly bipartisan group No Labels and 81 House and Senate lawmakers \u2014 some of the most liberal and conservative \u2014 will roll out a slate of specific legislative proposals with broad and surprising support across the ideological spectrum.         \n\nOdd couples like Representatives Cory Gardner, the Colorado Republican who was swept to the House in the 2010 Tea Party wave, and Peter Welch, a liberal Democrat from Vermont, will team on actual legislation, not statements of ideals, colored lapel ribbons or promises to sit together at State of the Union addresses.         \n\nSenators who embraced Tuesday\u2019s agreement to call off filibusters of executive-branch nominees promised this week to extend the spirit of compromise to more whole-Senate gatherings, retreats, budget negotiations and other vexing legislative matters. Seven senators, four Democrats and three Republicans, unveiled legislation on Wednesday to offer legal protection to journalists ensnared in leak investigations.         \n\n\u201cAs a prosecutor, I don\u2019t like to use the word \u2018gang,\u2019 but it\u2019s another big \u2018gang\u2019 we have here,\u201d said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota.         \n\nSenator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said a group was forming to try to reverse the automatic across-the-board spending cuts before they do more damage next fiscal year.         \n\nBut beyond those pledges of bonhomie, the institutional impediments to progress remain unchanged, especially in the Senate.         \n\nIndeed, the deal to head off the filibuster-rule change nearly derailed 24 hours after it was struck when Thomas E. Perez, President Obama\u2019s nominee to be labor secretary,  \n by a single vote on Wednesday afternoon, 60 to 40.         \n\nThe Republican Senators John McCain of Arizona, the architect of the filibuster deal; Lamar Alexander and Bob Corker of Tennessee; Mark Steven Kirk of Illinois; and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska saved the nominee \u2014 and the supposedly growing spirit of bipartisanship.         \n\n\u201cRight now the only people who are empowered are the obstructionists,\u201d said Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, who in 2005 joined 13 other senators to thwart an effort to end filibusters of judicial nominees but was ready to back the move to end filibusters of executive nominations this round. \u201cAnd for the rest of us, the power we should be wielding on behalf of our constituents is virtually nil,\u201d she said. \u201cSomething has to be done.\u201d         \n\nSince Democrats began threatening action to neuter the filibuster, critics have warned that simple majority votes in the Senate would make that chamber like the House, where the majority rules absolutely. But with a 60-vote threshold in the Senate, the minority party tends to rule absolutely on any issue lacking overwhelming bipartisan support.         \n\nThat is because only the largest gang can muster 60 votes, and a premium is placed on leadership loyalty in the minority party.
