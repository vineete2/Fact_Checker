{"headline": "In Obesity Epidemic, Poverty Is an Ignored Contagion", "body": "\nUnder the category \u201cSummer Rentals That Have Gone Terribly Wrong,\u201d there are perhaps few parallels to the experience of  \n, a Manhattan banker who, in 1906, took a house in Oyster Bay on Long Island\u2019s North Shore. By the end of the season, Mr. Warren\u2019s young daughter had developed typhoid. She was soon followed in illness by Mr. Warren\u2019s wife, a second daughter, two maids and a gardener. At the time, typhoid, a bacterial illness spread through contaminated food and water, was largely a disease of the urban poor. The property\u2019s owner, George Thompson, concerned that the house, on which he relied for rental income, would become associated with tenement filth in the minds of wealthy New Yorkers, invited a sanitary engineer to determine the source of the outbreak.         \n\nWhat the medical investigator, George Soper, discovered was that the Warrens\u2019 cook,  \n an Irish immigrant, had left an imprint of malady in other quarters of upper-class Manhattan and its summer enclaves. Typhoid, he wrote, had erupted in every household in which Mallon had worked over the previous decade. An asymptomatic carrier of the disease, Ms. Mallon would be known to history as Typhoid Mary and spend most of the remainder of her life quarantined on North Brother Island in the East River, having failed to abide by a promise to cease working in the city\u2019s kitchens.         \n\nThe events supply the narrative of  \na new novel by Mary Beth Keane, which arrives at a time when we are once again debating the parameters of public health policy\u2019s encroachments on our behaviors. Last week, a State Supreme Court justice in Manhattan  \n in striking down the Bloomberg administration\u2019s efforts to limit the size of sugary drinks (which pertained to certain sweetened beverages but not others, and some retail environments but not all). The phrase, though, could have been similarly applied a century ago to the city\u2019s treatment of Ms. Mallon, given that officials were not in the habit of isolating other healthy carriers whom they had identified as ignoring ordinances against the spread of the disease.         \n\nSequestering Ms. Mallon was not the only possible solution to her defiance. As the medical historian \nhas argued, the city might have helped provide her with the kind of long-term employment that would have given her a salary commensurate with what she was earning preparing meals for the well-off. But it didn\u2019t. Health officials were presumably most unnerved by the fact that Ms. Mallon was transporting an illness of the steerage classes uptown.         \n\nThen as now, economic disparity was, in many cases, driving disparate demographic patterns of disease. (Just to be clear, typhoid, though communicable, was not a greater threat to public health than obesity is today. In the early 20th century, there were about 3,000 to 4,000 new cases a year in New York, approximately 10 percent of them resulting in fatalities. Last fall, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said 6,000 New Yorkers a year died from obesity.) Obesity and its related illnesses, as we know,  \n. In Brooklyn, for instance, the rate of heart-attack hospitalizations among adults 35 and older in East New York is nearly twice the rate in wealthier Brooklyn Heights and Park Slope.         \n\nThe larger issue, though \u2014 larger than the matter of how much more time we should spend trying to ensure that no child ever grows up with a memory of a 32-ounce Sprite \u2014 is the recognition of poverty itself as a public health problem. The poor are more likely to live with asthma, depression, gun violence and pests (and the chemical pesticides used to eliminate them). The articulated goal should not simply be to create a population of poor people who are thin, but to create a population of poor people who are less poor. In 2010, the poverty rate in the city remained what it was 10 years earlier, 21 percent.         \n\nLate-19th- and early-20th-century public health initiatives, like urging immigrant mothers to breast-feed, might reek of nanny-state paternalism, but they occurred during a high moment of social, labor, political and scientific reform, the rise of the settlement movement, the writings of Jacob Riis. Great and systematic attention was paid to the lives and environments of those struggling in the lowest orders.         \n\nIt is hard not to wonder whether Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s soda limit initiative might have garnered more enthusiasm (though obviously not from the soft-drink industry, whose ad campaigns against it imagine democracy imperiled at the threat of less Pepsi) if it had been delivered within the context of a more consistent and compassionate message about the city\u2019s commitment to the underserved. If it had come from a mayor who, when responding to news of the city\u2019s rising homelessness rate, did not quickly blame the fact that city shelters must accommodate all comers, as he did recently, saying, \u201cYou can arrive in your private jet at Kennedy Airport, take a private limousine and go straight to the shelter system and walk in the door and we\u2019ve got to give you shelter.\u201d         \n\nPellegrino government would hardly seem to be enough.
