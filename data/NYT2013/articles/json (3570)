{"headline": "Deal Represents Turn for Syria; Rebels Deflated", "body": "\nBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Both sides in Syria\u2019s civil war see the  \n President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s chemical weapons stockpiles as a major turning point. It left rebels deflated and government supporters jubilant. And both sides say it means the United States knows Mr. Assad is not going anywhere anytime soon.         \n\nThe agreement between the United States and Russia, Mr. Assad\u2019s most powerful backer, ended weeks of tension over the possibility of an imminent American military strike. Plans for such a strike  \n while the diplomatic process surrounding the agreement plays out, engaging Mr. Assad\u2019s government and infusing it with new confidence that could have immediate impact.         \n\nRebels who had hoped to capitalize on a military strike to regain momentum in the fighting are now bracing for the opposite, expecting Mr. Assad to press the battle more aggressively with conventional weapons, which they bitterly note have killed scores of times as many civilians as chemical weapons have.         \n\nRebels and analysts critical of Mr. Assad\u2019s government say he has a well-established pattern of agreeing to diplomatic initiatives to buy time, only to go on escalating the fighting.         \n\nFor example, when Mr. Assad accepted  \n in the country in late 2011 and early 2012, he also intensified his crackdown on opponents, and shortly afterward he began the large-scale bombardments of rebel-held areas,  \n of Homs, that have since become daily occurrences.         \n\nKamel Wazne, a Lebanese analyst who has close contacts with senior members of Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia that has  \n, said Sunday that the deal allowed the side of the Syrian government to exhale.         \n\n\u201cWhether the Americans like it or not,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen you negotiate the deal with the Russians as representatives of Bashar al-Assad, you acknowledged his existence and his continuation in power.\u201d         \n\nThough American officials keep saying that their threat of military force remains, Mr. Wazne added, the Syrian government is now reassured that there will be no strikes anytime soon, and that \u201cat least for today, life is normal in Damascus.\u201d         \n\nIn Washington, President Obama portrayed the agreement with Russia as a victory on an issue more important to American interests than the outcome of the war in Syria: curbing the use and proliferation of chemical weapons around the world. He suggested that the process of carrying out the deal could lay the groundwork for an eventual political settlement between backers and opponents of Mr. Assad.         \n\nThe widespread perception in the region, though, was that every player had gained something in the past few weeks except the rebels \u2014 and, in large part, Syrian civilians, who human rights groups say have been systematically attacked by the government, and who have suffered abuses from both sides.         \n\nMr. Wazne listed the winners: Mr. Obama avoided a potentially embarrassing defeat in Congress over the use of force in Syria; the Russian and Syrian governments bought time for Mr. Assad; Israel can look forward to the removal of a chemical arsenal on its border; and Iran, which had threatened to retaliate for a military strike on its ally Syria, avoided an escalating confrontation with the West.         \n\nOpponents of Mr. Assad expressed worry that the effort to eliminate the chemical weapons might stall or be evaded, and that even if the weapons were successfully eliminated, Mr. Assad would gain strength from the deal if it was not accompanied by significantly increased military aid to the rebels.         \n\nSamir Nashar, a member of the National Coalition of Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, the main opposition group in exile, said that the subtext of the agreement appeared to be that Mr. Assad would remain in power until at least through mid-2014, when the deal calls for the clearing of his chemical weapons stockpiles to be complete. Meanwhile, he said, the rebel fighters who are under the Western-backed coalition\u2019s umbrella will continue to lose ground, not only to Mr. Assad\u2019s forces but also to extremist rivals among the rebels.         \n\n\u201cThis chaos will be extended,\u201d Mr. Nashar said in an interview in Istanbul.         \n\nMr. Assad appeared to have bought time for another goal as well: his current term as president ends in 2014, and his supporters have long said that he would hang on to complete his term and seek another, and that the West, fearing radical Islamists among the rebels, would acquiesce.         \n\nRebels and their supporters reacted angrily on Sunday to an  \n that the deal could ensure that \u201cthe worst weapons, the indiscriminate weapons that don\u2019t distinguish between a soldier and an infant, are not used.\u201d The Syrian government\u2019s air and artillery strikes on civilian neighborhoods also fail to discriminate between combatants and noncombatants, they said, and the Assad forces have shown few qualms about inflicting suffering on civilians.         \n\nFor their part, Syrian officials insisted that while the deal entailed acknowledging that the country possessed chemical weapons, they did not see it as an admission that they had used them.
