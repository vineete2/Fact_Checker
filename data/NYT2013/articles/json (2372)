{"headline": "Corporate Jet Center Exposes Silicon Valley\u2019s Class Divide", "body": "\nSAN JOSE, Calif. \u2014 The approval of a new corporate jet center at this city\u2019s struggling airport might have been just another losing skirmish in the battle between Silicon Valley billionaires and middle-class neighborhoods worried about noise pollution. Instead, it is becoming the latest symbol for the rapidly growing gap between the region\u2019s haves, with their private jets and untold wealth, and the have-nots, clinging to more modest lives in the dwindling number of communities they can afford.         \n\nGoogle, which is responsible for many of the jets that will use the new $82 million center, is helping bring badly needed cash to Mineta San Jose International Airport, just as the tech industry is creating jobs and wealth in Silicon Valley. But the tech boom is also sharpening  \n and fueling a housing boom that is squeezing families out of many Silicon Valley communities.         \n\nWhether it is the possibility of private jets\u2019 disturbing the sleep of San Jose homeowners, or the transformation of Palo Alto\u2019s last mobile home park into luxury apartments, local developments throughout Silicon Valley highlight how the tech boom is leaving many behind. Local officials worry about the trend, which experts say will only accelerate, and its effects on the valley\u2019s work force and diversity.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very focused on being a progressive and fair community in terms of those issues,\u201d Gregory Scharff, mayor of Palo Alto, said of efforts to provide affordable housing while recognizing the \u201cnational treasure\u201d that is Silicon Valley. \u201cWe actually innovate and create huge wealth for the United States. If you look at the companies that have just come out of Palo Alto, I would make you a bet that it would be one of the largest G.N.P.\u2019s \u2014 it could be a country.\u201d         \n\nIn the past, the tech industry created middle-class jobs and lifted the overall economy of Silicon Valley. But as tech companies have shifted manufacturing and midlevel jobs overseas over the years, highly paid workers have increasingly clustered here. Per-capita incomes have been rising even as median incomes have decreased for five years in a row, according to  \n, a private organization that co-publishes an annual report on the region.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting more high earners, and they\u2019re skewing the averages completely off,\u201d said Russell Hancock, chief executive of Joint Venture. \u201cWe are becoming a community where our teachers, our police, our firefighters, our nurses, they can\u2019t live with us. They have to come in from other places. Healthy communities have all these people living together.\u201d         \n\nSales figures for single-family homes in Santa Clara and San Mateo, the two main counties in Silicon Valley, show median prices have risen about 30 percent in the past year while the inventory of available homes has fallen by roughly half, according to an analysis of local multiple listing service data by the Silicon Valley Association of Realtors. The median prices for March \u2014 $735,000 in Santa Clara and $925,000 in San Mateo \u2014 only hint at the current market\u2019s frenzy.         \n\nEach property now typically attracts between 10 and 30 offers, eventually selling from 5 percent to 25 percent above the asking price, said Moise Nahouraii, the owner of Referral Realty in Cupertino. Jeff Barnett, a former president of the association and a regional vice president at Alain Pinel Realtors, said 30 percent to 40 percent of sales were paid in cash.         \n\n\u201cLast year, the market came up,\u201d Mr. Barnett said. \u201cThis year, it\u2019s on fire; it\u2019s just unreal.\u201d         \n\nIn Palo Alto, one of the hottest markets, the longtime owner of the Buena Vista Mobile Home Park has moved to sell the property to a developer planning to build a complex with amenities that include a pool, a spa, a business center, a chef\u2019s demonstration kitchen and a pet grooming station. A local ordinance would guarantee the park\u2019s 400 residents \u2014 more than a quarter of whom are children and 85 percent are Hispanic \u2014 some compensation and possible relocation within Palo Alto.         \n\nBut the  \n, a private group that provides free legal services on housing and other issues, is pressing the city to reject the conversion. With the waiting lists for affordable housing getting longer by the day, the group argues, the park\u2019s residents will be forced to leave Palo Alto, away from jobs and schools.         \n\nOne resident, Mary Kear, 55, grew up in Mountain View, where her father owned a hardware store and was a farmer, and where Google has its headquarters. Ms. Kear, who worked in sales for more than three decades and is now a part-time school custodian, said she had to move a dozen times over the years because of rising rents, eventually gravitating to the park eight years ago. She hoped the city would reject the conversion.         \n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m also going to try to talk to the guy at Facebook,\u201d she said in the living room of her tidy two-room trailer, adding that she had read that the company\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, had recently established a political action committee for  \n reform. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to help immigrants, and immigrants are here.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/03/us/airport-project-reflects-a-changing-silicon-valley.html", "date": "2013-05-02", "description": "A technology boom that once created middle-class jobs and lifted the overall economy now fuels a growing gap between the very rich and everyone else."}
