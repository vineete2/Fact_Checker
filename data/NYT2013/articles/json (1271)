{"headline": "Such a Chowder!", "body": "\n \n, which has been located at 179 East Houston Street on the Lower East Side of Manhattan since 1923, is what is known as an appetizing store. \u201cAppetizing\u201d is a noun. It denotes the prepared foods, most often served cold \u2014 smoked salmon, herring in sauce, whitefish salad, caviar, cream cheese \u2014 that can accompany every public gathering in the life of a Jew living in New York City, from \u201cbris to shiva,\u201d as Niki Russ Federman, one of the owners, puts it.         \n\nOver time the place has become more than simply a store. Russ & Daughters is, for many, a secular synagogue, a temple to the enduring power of food and memory. \u201cI smell Judaism,\u201d a customer once told Niki: brine and yeast and smoke.         \n\nBut gentiles are welcome, too. As Lenny Bruce said, \u201cIf you\u2019re from New York and you\u2019re Catholic, you\u2019re still Jewish.\u201d (He added, \u201cIf you\u2019re from Butte, Mont., and you\u2019re Jewish, you\u2019re still goyish.\u201d)         \n\nMy father loved Russ & Daughters, though he never called it that. \u201cLet\u2019s go to Federmans,\u201d he would say when I was young, and it would lead to an hour spent kibitzing over the countertop with Mark Russ Federman, Niki\u2019s father, while I stood staring into the display cases, daydreaming, bored, learning, growing famished for herring in cream. Now I take my children to stand in the same spot while I talk to Josh Russ Tupper, Mark\u2019s nephew, who formally took over the place with his cousin Niki in 2010. They are the fourth generation of Russes to own the store. \u201cNot the belly lox,\u201d my daughter tugs on my hand to say. \u201cToo salty.\u201d         \n\nThe point of appetizing is that you don\u2019t have to cook it. There\u2019s a gathering; you don\u2019t have to make anything; you just order a spread and put it out. In a New York social gathering involving family, nothing is going to top a filleted smoked whitefish or a bowl of chopped herring. You are as likely to see them at a confirmation brunch or an Easter meal as at a bat mitzvah.         \n\nBut there are exceptions. One such is lox chowder, which makes use of the store\u2019s greatest value proposition: the trimmings left over from slicing lox to order, little bits of fish, sliced translucence. The cousins sell these in pint containers, $5 a pound. Cooked into soup, they become a New Yorkish take on a New England classic, replacing the double-tref ingredients of bacon and clams with the salty perfection of fatty smoked fish.         \n\nThere is a recipe for lox chowder in Mark Russ Federman\u2019s charming new memoir, \u201c \n.\u201d (Typical anecdote: In 2008, a Russian customer challenges Mark with the news that he is the store\u2019s oldest customer. Pulls out his driver\u2019s license to show that he is 103. \u201cYou were born in Russia,\u201d Mark says to the man. \u201cDid you know about the Russian Revolution?\u201d Pause. \u201cKnow about it? I was in it!\u201d)         \n\nThe soup tastes best made with Federman\u2019s trimmings, which offer a lot of fatty, flavorful bits from up around the fish\u2019s collar, but a number of test runs using supermarket smoked salmon offer evidence that the soup is still terrific when made outside the five boroughs, with a fantastic smokiness tempered by the sweet flavors of potato and leek.         \n\nAs a sign that used to hang in the store read, \u201cFor what you have you been waiting.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/magazine/such-a-chowder.html", "date": "2013-02-14", "description": "Straight from the appetizing counter, a smoked-salmon chowder that tastes of old New York."}
