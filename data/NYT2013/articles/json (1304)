{"headline": "Saudis Step Up Help for Rebels in Syria With Croatian Arms", "body": "\n \n has financed a large purchase of infantry weapons from  \n and quietly funneled them to antigovernment fighters in  \n in a drive to break the bloody stalemate that has allowed President  \n to cling to power, according to American and Western officials familiar with the purchases.         \n\nThe weapons began reaching rebels in December via shipments shuttled through Jordan, officials said, and have been a factor in the rebels\u2019 small tactical gains this winter against the army and militias loyal to Mr. Assad.         \n\nThe arms transfers appeared to signal a shift among several governments to a more activist approach to assisting Syria\u2019s armed opposition, in part as an effort to counter shipments of weapons from Iran to Mr. Assad\u2019s forces. The weapons\u2019 distribution has been principally to armed groups viewed as nationalist and secular, and appears to have been intended to bypass the jihadist groups whose roles in the war have alarmed Western and regional powers.         \n\nFor months regional and Western capitals have held back on arming the rebels, in part out of fear that the weapons would fall into the hands of terrorists. But officials said the decision to send in more weapons is aimed at another fear in the West about the role of jihadist groups in the opposition. Such groups have been seen as better equipped than many nationalist fighters and potentially more influential.         \n\nThe action also signals the recognition among the rebels\u2019 Arab and Western backers that the opposition\u2019s success in pushing Mr. Assad\u2019s military from much of Syria\u2019s northern countryside by the middle of last year gave way to a slow, grinding campaign in which the opposition remains outgunned and the human costs continue to climb.         \n\nWashington\u2019s role in the shipments, if any, is not clear. Officials in Europe and the United States, including those at the Central Intelligence Agency, cited the sensitivity of the shipments and declined to comment publicly.         \n\nBut one senior American official described the shipments as \u201ca maturing of the opposition\u2019s logistical pipeline.\u201d The official noted that the opposition remains fragmented and operationally incoherent, and added that the recent Saudi purchase was \u201cnot in and of itself a tipping point.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI remain convinced we are not near that tipping point,\u201d the official said.         \n\nThe official added that Iran, with its shipments to Syria\u2019s government, still outstrips what Arab states have sent to the rebels.         \n\nThe Iranian arms transfers have fueled worries among Sunni Arab states about losing a step to Tehran in what has become a regional contest for primacy in Syria between Sunni Arabs and the Iran-backed Assad government and Hezbollah of Lebanon.         \n\nAnother American official said Iran has been making flights with weapons into Syria that are so routine that he referred to them as \u201ca milk run.\u201d Several of the flights were by an Iranian Air Force Boeing jet using the name Maharaj Airlines, he said.         \n\nWhile Persian Gulf Arab nations have been sending military equipment and other assistance to the rebels for more than a year, the difference in the recent shipments has been partly of scale. Officials said multiple planeloads of weapons have left Croatia since December, when many Yugoslav weapons, previously unseen in the Syrian civil war, began to appear in videos posted by rebels on YouTube.         \n\nMany of the weapons \u2014 which include a particular type of Yugoslav-made recoilless gun, as well as assault rifles, grenade launchers, machine guns, mortars and shoulder-fired rockets for use against tanks and other armored vehicles \u2014 have been extensively documented by one blogger, Eliot Higgins, who writes under the name  \n and has mapped the new weapons\u2019 spread through the conflict.         \n\nHe first noticed the Yugoslav weapons in early January in clashes in the Dara\u2019a region near Jordan, but by February he was seeing them in videos posted by rebels fighting in the Hama, Idlib and Aleppo regions.         \n\nOfficials familiar with the transfers said the arms were part of an undeclared surplus in Croatia remaining from the 1990s Balkan wars. One Western official said the shipments included \u201cthousands of rifles and hundreds of machine guns\u201d and an unknown quantity of ammunition.         \n\nCroatia\u2019s Foreign Ministry and arms-export agency denied that such shipments had occurred. Saudi officials have declined requests for interviews about the shipments for two weeks. Jordanian officials also declined to comment.
