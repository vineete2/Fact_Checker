{"headline": "Bronx Courts Trim Big Backlog, With Outside Judge at the Helm", "body": "\nThe 19-year-old defendant balked at the plea offer: three and a half years to cover two felony cases of robbery and burglary that had lingered in Bronx courts for more than two years.         \n\n\u201cWhat else do you want?\u201d the judge shot back. \u201cWe\u2019re not sending you to the Bahamas with your attorney.\u201d         \n\nTo another defendant, a two-time felon accused of assaulting a fellow inmate and a prison guard, the judge warned that the offer of two to four years was a take-it-or-leave-it deal. Otherwise, he would immediately go to trial and face a possible life sentence on the most serious charge, attempted murder.         \n\n\u201cYou are at the end of your rope,\u201d the judge said.         \n\n\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d the defendant responded.         \n\nSo go the negotiations in the courtroom of  \n, a straight-talking State Supreme Court justice brought in to the Bronx from Brooklyn to do what she does best \u2014 put old cases to rest.         \n\nSince arriving in January, Justice DiMango has been an anomaly in the Bronx courts, where she is charged with clearing a backlog of felony cases that had swelled to crisis proportions. Her brash style and forceful personality, not to mention her relentless efficiency, have set her apart in a courthouse infamous for inaction.         \n\nIn six months, she has churned through more than 500 cases, slashing by 40 percent the backlog of those over two years old, and leading senior court officials to declare a partial victory after years of failed efforts.         \n\nBut the success has underscored how bad things had gotten inside the Bronx County Hall of Justice.  \n, promised in January to eliminate the backlog in six months, \u201cif not sooner.\u201d With that deadline passed, the borough\u2019s number of cases two years old or older remains the largest in New York City \u2014 more than Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens and Staten Island combined.         \n\nAnd the effort has required unpleasant compromises, like allowing a defendant accused of attempted murder to plead guilty to a charge of misdemeanor assault. That has provoked some grumbling that statistics were being pursued at the cost of justice, a claim senior court officials sharply deny.         \n\nNonetheless, the spectacle of bringing in a temporary team of outsiders has raised questions about whether the focus on showing immediate progress has come at the cost of a long-term commitment by court officials and the district attorney to change a pervasive culture of delay.         \n\nWith Justice DiMango overdue to return to Brooklyn \u2014 a team of other judges brought in from around the state to help conduct trials was sent home this month \u2014 many worry that the new momentum will stall with her departure. Indeed, some defense lawyers already say that not enough is being done to stop the systemic delays and resolve cases before they get old.         \n\n\u201cThe phenomenon is like a boat that\u2019s taking on water,\u201d said Steven Banks, the citywide attorney in chief of the Legal Aid Society. \u201cAs quickly as the water is bailed out, even more water is rushing in.\u201d         \n\nChief Judge Lippman announced the latest plan to clear the backlog as The New York Times was preparing  \n about the delays in the Bronx, which had been growing for decades. In a demonstration of shared focus,  \n, the longtime Bronx district attorney, stood alongside him.         \n\nThat partnership between the bench and the prosecutors has been critical to the success of the effort. In Justice DiMango\u2019s court, prosecutors are presenting more lenient plea offers, according to interviews with senior court officials, judges and defense lawyers. That represents a turnaround for District Attorney Johnson, who had a reputation for being bureaucratic and inflexible when it came to plea deals, once barring prosecutors from accepting pleas in felony cases unless they included the top charge.         \n\nThe better offers have come partly because of Justice DiMango\u2019s prodding. But the simple age of many of the cases \u2014 some are more than five years old \u2014 have weakened them as witnesses disappear and memories fade. In some instances, the cases were weak from the start; Bronx prosecutors win fewer than half the cases they bring to trial.         \n\nThe lowered bar has been enthusiastically received by defense lawyers, many of whom believe it reflects pressure to demonstrate progress.
