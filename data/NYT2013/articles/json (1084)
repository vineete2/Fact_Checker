{"headline": "When \u201860 Minutes\u2019 Checks Its Journalistic Skepticism at the Door", "body": "\nLast week, a study commissioned by the president  \n that the  \n had reached too far into the private lives of Americans. The study, which came after a series of journalistic revelations exposing the agency\u2019s surveillance practices, recommended numerous reforms that would curb the N.S.A.\u2019s prerogatives. President Obama said he was \u201copen to many\u201d of the suggestions.         \n\nIt was exactly the kind of news-making moment that \u201c60 Minutes\u201d \u2014 America\u2019s leading purveyor of serious television news \u2014 has often been responsible for creating. For more than four decades, the program has exposed C.I.A. abuses, rogue military contractors and hundreds of corporate villains.         \n\nBut where was \u201c60 Minutes\u201d on the N.S.A. story? The Sunday before the damning study, the program produced a segment that scanned as a friendly infomercial for the agency. Reported by John Miller, a CBS News reporter, the piece included  \n with Gen. Keith Alexander, the director of the N.S.A.         \n\nIn a scene that served as something of a metaphor for the whole segment, the producers negotiated access to the Black Chamber, a supersecret area where the nation\u2019s top code breakers work. The door is briefly opened, we see a deserted office hall that looks like any other and then the door is closed. We get a look in, but we learn nothing.         \n\nComing as it does on the heels of the  \n \u2014 in which \u201c60 Minutes\u201d said it was fooled by an eyewitness who was apparently nothing of the kind \u2014 the N.S.A. segment raises the question of whether the program has not just temporarily lost its mojo, but its skepticism as well. It didn\u2019t help that the day after the piece aired, a federal judge ruled that the agency\u2019s program of collecting phone records was  \n.         \n\nIn between its coverage of Benghazi and the N.S.A., \u201c60 Minutes\u201d drew criticism for letting Amazon promote a drone delivery program that is years from actually happening, if it happens at all. It was  \n at the commercial future, though  \n, the reporter, also asked Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, some tough questions: whether providing cloud services to the C.I.A. was a conflict, and whether its \u201cruthless\u201d pursuit of market share was fair.         \n\nLet\u2019s stipulate that \u201c60 Minutes\u201d has been and continues to be a journalistic treasure, which just this year has done hard-hitting pieces on the  \n, the  \n among returning veterans, and how tainted pain medication that caused fungal meningitis  \n. Mr. Rose also landed  \n with the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, about chemical weapons. At a time when both the definition and execution of news has dimmed, \u201c60 Minutes\u201d stands out.         \n\nHistorically, the news that \u201c60 Minutes\u201d was in the lobby or on the phone has struck fear in the hearts of both the stalwart and the venal. The show made its targets quake and audiences thrill as it did the hard, often amazing work of creating consequence and accountability.         \n\nBut in the last few months, there have been significant lapses into credulousness, when reporters have been more \u201cgee whiz\u201d than \u201cwhat gives?\u201d The news that \u201c60 Minutes\u201d is calling could be viewed as less ominous and more of an opportunity. More than once this year, the show has traded skepticism for access.         \n\nWhen it comes to the access game, everyone, even \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d plays ball on occasion. When it seeks to lighten things up, as it did with Taylor Swift, or Maggie Smith of \u201cDownton Abbey,\u201d no one expects hidden cameras or brutal interrogations. Everyone, including the audience, knows the score.         \n\nBut viewers expect the show to bring its A game, and deserve it, when it takes on a huge issue like the N.S.A., to serve as a stand-in for the American people and ask the uncomfortable questions.         \n\nMr. Miller is a former high-ranking official in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and a former spokesman of the F.B.I. whose worldview is built on going after bad guys and keeping the rest of us safe. In his report, Mr. Alexander was allowed to parse his responses, suggesting that the collection and retention of telephone metadata from Americans is not a big deal \u2014 it is \u2014 and that the agency is \u201cnot collecting everybody\u2019s email, we\u2019re not collecting everybody\u2019s phone things.\u201d The report delivered to the president last week said that the agency was doing a great deal of both and that it should stop.         \n\nAfter taking over \u201c60 Minutes\u201d from Don Hewitt less than 10 years ago, Jeffrey Fager has managed to maintain the journalistic momentum of the news division\u2019s crown jewel. In 2011, he was named chairman of CBS News, and since then has earned high marks for helping restore hard news at the evening news program and developing a distinct identity for \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d by emphasizing topical coverage.         \n\nBut people inside and outside the news division have questioned whether those dual roles are stretching him too thin. An  \n into the Benghazi fiasco cited fundamental lapses in execution, including missed opportunities to check the story of Dylan Davies, a contractor who had told conflicting accounts about his whereabouts on the night of the attacks on the American diplomatic mission.         \n\nOf course, any news organization can be fooled \u2014 The New York Times  \n with its reports of supposed weapons of mass destruction in the run-up to the Iraq war \u2014 but it was hard to watch the N.S.A. segment and not wonder who was minding the store.
