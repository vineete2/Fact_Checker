{"headline": "In Surprise, Fed Decides to Maintain Pace of Stimulus", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 It turns out that the Federal Reserve is not quite ready to let go of its extra efforts to help the economy grow.         \n\nAll summer, Federal Reserve officials said flattering things about the economy\u2019s performance: how strong it looked, how well it was recovering, how eager they were to step back and watch it walk on its own.         \n\nBut, in a reversal that stunned economists and investors on Wall Street, the Fed said on Wednesday that it would postpone any retreat from its monetary stimulus campaign for at least another month and quite possibly until next year. The Fed\u2019s chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, emphasized that economic conditions were improving. But he said that the Fed still feared a turn for the worse.         \n\nHe noted that Congressional Republicans and the White House were hurtling toward an impasse over government spending. That was reinforced on Wednesday, when House leaders said they would seek to pass a federal budget stripping all financing for President Obama\u2019s signature health care law, increasing the chances of a government shutdown.         \n\nAnd the Fed undermined its own efforts when it declared in June that it intended to begin a retreat by the end of the year, causing investors to immediately begin to demand higher interest rates on mortgage loans and other financial products, a trend that the Fed said Wednesday was threatening to slow the economy.         \n\n\u201cWe have been overoptimistic,\u201d Mr. Bernanke said at a news conference Wednesday. The Fed, he said, is \u201cavoiding a tightening until we can be comfortable that the economy is in fact growing the way that we want it to be growing.\u201d         \n\nInvestors cheered the Fed\u2019s hesitation. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock-index rose 1.22 percent, to close at a record high, in nominal terms. Interest rates also fell; the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury reversed some of its recent rise.         \n\nSome analysts, however, warned that the unexpected announcement was likely to worsen confusion about the Fed\u2019s plans, increasing the volatility of the markets in the coming months as investors sort through the Fed\u2019s mixed messages about how much longer it plans to continue its bond-buying campaign. The delay also means that the decision to retreat may ultimately be made by the next Fed chairman, after Mr. Bernanke steps down at the end of January. President Obama has said that he plans to nominate a replacement as soon as next week. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s vice chairman, is the leading candidate.         \n\n\u201cThe cost of not setting out on a default gradual glide path for completing QE3 today is that this issue is now likely to be front and center in the nomination and confirmation process for the new Fed chair,\u201d wrote Krishna Guha, head of central bank strategy at the financial services firm International Strategy & Investment, referring to the Fed\u2019s asset purchases of quantitative easing.         \n\nThe Fed unrolled an aggressive combination of new policies last year in an effort to encourage a housing recovery and increase the pace of job creation. It started adding $85 billion a month to its holdings of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities, to help keep long-term borrowing costs down and said it planned to keep buying until the outlook for the labor market improved substantially. The Fed also said it would keep short-term rates near zero for even longer \u2014 at least as long as the unemployment rate remained above 6.5 percent.         \n\nHalf a year later, in June, Mr. Bernanke surprised many investors by announcing that the Fed intended to start cutting back on those asset purchases by the end of 2013. Fed officials reiterated that intention in July, and several officials had since suggested that the Fed might begin to pull back at the September meeting. It is also scheduled to meet next month and in mid-December.         \n\nSome critics question the Fed\u2019s assessment of the economy, in particular its claim that a declining unemployment rate is a sign of progress. They note that unemployment is falling in part because fewer people are looking for work, and therefore are no longer officially counted as unemployed.
