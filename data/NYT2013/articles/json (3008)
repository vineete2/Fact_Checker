{"headline": "Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin\u2019s Post-Scandal Playbook", "body": "\nOne day in early February, I met Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin for breakfast at the Gramercy Park Hotel, one of their regular joints, just a few blocks from their apartment on Park Avenue South. The first thing Weiner said when I sat down was that their 13-month-old son, Jordan, had just moments ago taken his first step. They were both giddy, kvelling with baby-pride, especially Weiner, who, with all his free time, has become his son\u2019s primary caretaker. This is what life is like now for the man whose name is invariably followed in print by some version of \u201cthe disgraced former congressman who sent out a lewd picture of himself via Twitter.\u201d He seems to spend much of his time within a five-block radius of his apartment: going to the park with Jordan; picking up his wife\u2019s dry cleaning and doing the grocery shopping; eating at his brother Jason\u2019s two restaurants in the neighborhood. This is what happens after a scandal: Ranks are closed and the world shrinks to a tiny dot. It is a life in retreat. And for a man who was known, pre-scandal, for his overweening ambition, his constant presence on cable news, his hard-charging schedule that verged on lunacy, well, it has been quite a change.         \n\nBecause of their careers, Weiner and Abedin are pros when it comes to small talk, chatting about the baby, their two cats and the pleasures of domestic life. But as the conversation shifted into why we were there, Weiner got serious and went into problem-solving mode; Abedin, while still cheerful and talkative, started to look a little nervous. As Abedin pointed out to me later, she has a tendency toward pessimism. \u201cAnthony,\u201d she said, \u201cis a glass-half-full person. He doesn\u2019t dwell. He\u2019s not negative.\u201d         \n\nThey present as two people who have painstakingly pieced their private life back together: they cook dinner and watch TV and have friends and family over to their spacious prewar apartment for special occasions. They seem to be functioning again as a couple, even unselfconsciously bickering in front of the waiter. But what they do not yet have a handle on is their public life. Before he resigned from Congress, Weiner was leading in early polls as a candidate for mayor of New York, and almost immediately after the scandal, there was speculation about whether he could make a comeback. Could anyone survive such an ignominious end to a Congressional career? Much less someone whose attack-dog tendencies made him so many enemies? The two of them had seemed to be a power couple on the cusp of a Clintonian rise. Now what?         \n\nWhen they appeared in People magazine last summer, it looked like a toe-dipping of sorts. (The couple say that it was entirely for the purpose of getting a picture of Jordan published so it would no longer have value and the paparazzi would stop camping out on their corner.) But there were other reports that suggested they were testing the waters for a return to politics: Last July, The New York Post reported that Weiner was weighing a run in 2013, because after that his public matching funds would expire. In January, The New York Daily News reported that Weiner\u2019s name was among the candidates voters were asked about in a poll of a five-way mayoral primary. And The New York Post reported that pollsters had asked voters about a run for comptroller, pitting Weiner against the Manhattan Borough president, Scott Stringer.         \n\nAt breakfast, Weiner quickly put all the speculation to rest: he is eyeing the mayor\u2019s race. He told me that his political committee spent more than $100,000 on polling and research by Obama\u2019s longtime pollster, David Binder (a detail that would be made public \u2014 and prompt a flurry of news reports \u2014 in mid-March when a spending report was filed with the city\u2019s Campaign Finance Board). The focus of the poll, Binder says, was the question \u201cAre voters willing to give him a second chance or not, regardless of what race or what contest?\u201d And the answer? \u201cThere was this sense of \u2018Yeah, he made a mistake. Let\u2019s give him a second chance. But there are conditions on that, and there are a couple of things we\u2019re going to want to know: What have you been doing since this incident occurred? Did you learn anything from this mistake? How did you deal with it?\u2019 They want to know that they\u2019ve put it behind them.\u201d         \n\nBy agreeing to be interviewed, Weiner and Abedin would seem to be trying to give voters what they want \u2014 and gauge public reaction. But it\u2019s clear that the idea of talking about the scandal and its aftermath appeals to them on a personal level too. \u201cWe have been in a defensive crouch for so long,\u201d Weiner said. \u201cWe are ready to clear the decks on this thing.\u201d Their lives have become too small, too circumscribed, too claustrophobic for a couple accustomed to public life. They haven\u2019t been to a major event together \u2014 no White House Correspondents Dinner, no red-carpet events \u2014 in nearly two years. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to make other people uncomfortable,\u201d Abedin said, \u201cbut also, we just didn\u2019t want to deal with it. I have now gotten used to people asking, over and over again, \u2018How is Anthony?\u2019 Oh, he\u2019s good! \u2018But how is he  \n?\u2019 He\u2019s doing fine.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/magazine/anthony-weiner-and-huma-abedins-post-scandal-playbook.html", "date": "2013-04-10", "description": "Taking the plunge back into public life after a marital (and political) catastrophe."}
