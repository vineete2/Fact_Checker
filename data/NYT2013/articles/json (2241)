{"headline": "If You Like Rickie Lee Jones, Try ZZ Ward", "body": "\n \n         \n\nI\u2019d like to introduce you to a newcomer on the music scene, a singer/songwriter and multi-instrumentalist, ZZ Ward. I vascillated over whom to pair her with. Her energy evokes Tina Turner's, her chops Aretha Franklin's and her soul Etta James's. But in the end, all signs pointed to the singer/songwriter Rickie Lee Jones.         \n\nIt\u2019s striking how many ways their lives run parallel. Both grew up in rural settings; wear signature hats (Ms. Jones berets, Ms. Ward fedoras); drive trucks; have unusual first names; come from musically talented families; have brothers who influenced their lives; moved to Los Angeles at an early age and immediately wowed\u205fsome\u205fimportant music labels; creatively mix genres; saw\u205ftheir music used\u205fin television and film; produced an album of cover songs; and love to collaborate with other artists. (Whew!) But the clincher was they both sing about a man named Charlie.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n\n \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nMy friend Suzu saw her at a small place in Greenwich Village in 1979. (She can\u2019t remember the exact spot, perhaps The Village Gate \u2014 were any of you there?) I asked Suzu what she remembered about the show. \"Rickie Lee Jones was the epitome of cool,\" she said.         \n\nMs. Jones was christened \u201c \n\u201d in 1979 by Time magazine\u2019s Jay Cocks, who described her music as \"a dash of scat, a hipster backbeat and a lyric that truly glides, laid down in a voice of sweet rough-and-tumble.\" Her music ranges from R&B to blues, pop, soul and jazz. If you\u2019ve heard her hit single \u201cChuck E\u2019s in Love\u201d you understand.         \n\nShe was born in November 1954 in Chicago to a mother who was a waitress, a trumpet-player father and vaudevillian grandparents. As  \na radio host, noted, \u201cWith a childhood that had her moving around a lot, and a father who was somewhere between an itinerant musician, laborer and a hobo, Rickie Lee Jones absorbed music from her father, as well as his tendency to ramble around.\u201d She moved to Los Angeles at 19, waited tables and played occasional music gigs. Lowell George of the band Little Feat heard her and introduced her to his recording company, which led to her 1979 self-titled debut album. It earned her a Grammy Award for Best New Artist. After moving to New York City, Ms. Jones released more albums through the '80s and '90s but was dealing with other demons like heartbreak, drug addiction and writer's block.  \n Some have called her the first video star; an 11-minute Warner Brothers short film creatively promoted her image so well it can be seen as an early rendition of the music video. Her music has been included in soundtracks for television (\"Thirtysomething\"), film (\"Jerry Maguire\"), and commercials (McDonalds and Dr. Pepper). In 1977 Ms. Jones met the musician Tom Waits at The Troubador, the start of a long relationship (he eventually married someone else).  \n produced an album of cover songs featuring Ms. Jones\u2019s renditions of hits by the Beatles, Marvin Gaye and Steely Dan to name a few.         \n\n \n\n \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nWhen you first hear her music you might think it\u2019s Adele, but keep listening \u2014 there\u2019s a  \n.  \n, a 24-year-old with an affinity for fedoras, grew up in Roseburg, Ore. \u201cThat\u2019s way out in the country on a 23 acre-farm lot. There was nothing around me for so long that I just wanted something more,\" she said in  \n (of St. Joseph, Mo.).  \n She grew up on her father\u2019s blues collection, including Muddy Waters, Etta James and Big Mama Thornton and by 12 was performing in her father's band. She was also influenced by the hip-hop music her two older brothers were listening to, like Jay Z and Nas. She was so into hip-hop that she would drive 90 minutes to Eugene to perform with hip-hop bands. She moved to Los Angeles in 2009 knowing no one, and two years later she was working with Michael Jackson's producer, Nephew. Along the way, she shortened her name to  \n(thank heavens!). She has wide appeal: I play her music at my cocktail parties, and my 21-year-old son plays it at his college/frat parties. He \u201cgets\u201d her clever twist of hip-hop laced with blues-rock.         \n\nShe calls her sound \u201cDirty Shine\u201d a phrase she describes as a mix of blues, soul, hip-hop and pop \u2014 and whatever else she\u2019s in the mood to throw in. Talented? She also plays guitar, piano and harmonica. Her debut album \"Til the Casket Drops\" was released by Hollywood Records only last October and already her shows are selling out. Fans know the lyrics and when they\u2019re not singing along, they\u2019re tweeting:  \n  \n         \n\n \nLast weekend, before a sold-out show at Lincoln Hall, I interviewed ZZ as part of a preconcert appearance at the Apple Store on Michigan Avenue in Chicago. Despite all the media attention she has been receiving, she was sweet and straightforward. And though she says she's from \"the sticks\" she looks like a model from Vogue. Once you know her music you'll start hearing it everywhere. I heard it in Saks Fifth Avenue in Manhattan yesterday. She confirmed what I've read about her song \"Charlie Ain't Home\" \u2014 she wrote it in answer to her idol Etta James's song \"Waiting for Charlie (To Come Home).\" She has  \n (one of the few nonrappers to do so) called\"Eleven Roses\" containing eight tracks of heavy beat with blues and a little harmonica. When I picked up her CD, I picked up two: I didn\u2019t want to have to share with my kids.  \nZZ Ward is currently on tour with Delta Rae, and they  \non March 5.         \n\nGeorge Graham, in his weekly music review, writes, \u201cDurability in the music world, if you\u2019re a singer-songwriter, pretty much requires resourcefulness, as well as a deep well of originality.\u201d He was referring to Rickie Lee Jones. I believe it applies to ZZ Ward as well.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/27/booming/if-you-like-rickie-lee-jones-try-zz-ward.html", "date": "2013-03-01", "description": "Rickie Lee Jones and ZZ Ward have much in common, including durability, resourcefulness and originality."}
