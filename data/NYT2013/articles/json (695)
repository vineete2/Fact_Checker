{"headline": "Under the Summer Dome: A Vacation Horror Story", "body": "\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nIt was a typical summer weekend in the bucolic town of Chester\u2019s Mill, Me., only worse as it was that time when camp is over and school has not yet started and everyone\u2019s family is visiting.         \n\nMaisie Adams, a retired schoolteacher, was at the produce stand off Route 119 buying three bushels of tomatoes, two dozen peach pies and 200 ears of corn. She was loading it into her S.U.V. when her friend Annie, who, Maisie could tell by her haggard expression, also had a full house, pulled up, a small U-Haul attached to her car.         \n\n\u201cHey there, Maisie, leave a few dozen of those pies for me,\u201d Annie hollered good-naturedly. \u201cYou aren\u2019t the only person in town who\u2019s got family visiting. Isn\u2019t it something how these people eat? And God forbid any one of them lifts their face off of their phone to say thank you. I have grandkids I couldn\u2019t recognize; all I\u2019ve seen for the last four summers are the tops of their heads.\u201d         \n\n\u201cYeah, and the parents are even worse,\" Maisie said. \"They use up all the hot water, overload the septic system, park in the garden, leave the screen door open so the bugs get in and the cat gets out and give the dog chocolate and it kills him. And don\u2019t even get me started on their bad habits. But one good thing about family, eventually they go back home.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIndeed they do,\u201d Annie said.         \n\nThey had 40 seconds left to smile \u2013 40 seconds before an indestructible dome would slam down on their town, sealing them off from the outside world and showing them the true meaning of togetherness.         \n\n***         \n\nMaisie\u2019s house was a sprawling, renovated Victorian with a great room, a not-so-great room, and five bedrooms, only four of which had private baths. This led to considerable rivalry among Maisie\u2019s adult children who, while they might go for several months without speaking to their mother, never once forgot to call her in June to say they would love to come up to Maine for some serious family time, but only if they could have a room with a bathroom.         \n\nMaisie\u2019s children were at the house now, whining about the white wine although it is difficult to say that three times fast, and wondering when Maisie would get home and start fixing lunch. It had been two hours since they had eaten.         \n\nThere were also personal problems Maisie\u2019s children needed to discuss.         \n\nLauren, 32 and engaged to be married, needed to explain to her mother the necessity of a destination wedding in Tahiti, which Lauren, on her meager aroma-therapist\u2019s salary, could not be expected to pay for herself. And a woman\u2019s second wedding should be special.         \n\nArnie, a freelance writer living in New York, needed to make his mother understand that  \n got paid to write any-more and that at 38, he should not be expected to carry a city apartment on his own.         \n\nAmy, Maisie\u2019s youngest daughter, had decided this would be the day to confront her mother about her unhealthy life choices: Stubbornly refusing to buy gluten-free products though it would add a mere hour each way to Maisie\u2019s shopping trips; refusing to get rid of her dog, Rex, a tick-bearing, Lyme disease vector, who, Amy suspected, had never once been properly groomed. Nor could Amy tolerate Maisie\u2019s resistance to Amy raising her infant daughter diaper free; toilet training her by holding her over ceramic bowls scattered throughout the house. When did her mother last use those Meissen bowls anyway?         \n\nSuddenly there was a thunderous THUNK!!! as the towering wall of a gigantic transparent dome came slamming down outside the house.         \n\nMaisie\u2019s children watched disbelieving as the extended foot of the Fed Ex man who had only just delivered a case of Santorini assyrtikos from Greece was severed.         \n\nThen there were mounting screams as the visitors understood the full horror of what had transpired.         \n\n\u201cOh, my God,\u201d Lauren wailed. \u201cNow we\u2019ll never be able to get a decent sauvignon blanc!\u201d         \n\n***         \n\nNight had fallen and it was now clear to all: The town of Chester\u2019s Mill was encapsulated, entombed in a giant transparent dome. Cellphone communication had ceased; teenagers, their vocal chords atrophied by years of texting, struggled vainly to communicate, staggering around town, making zombie-like \u201cAaarghh, aarghh\u201d sounds, reduced finally to scrawling desperate notes to their parents:         \n\n\u201cI hate you.\u201d \u201cLike you know something about it.\u201d \u201cYou disgust me.\u201d         \n\nVisiting adults, unable to get on Facebook and post photos of themselves and their loving siblings having marvelous times against pink sunsets, were reduced to silently sitting together at the dinner table, thinking about how much they loathed one another.         \n\nThe townspeople, meanwhile, worked frantically to smash their way out of the dome.         \n\nRoad-repair crews attacked the dome with jackhammers and bulldozers; members of the Volunteer Fire Department whacked at it with hatchets; Sheriff Howard Perkins, called the Duck, shot at it with his .45; gardeners tried to tunnel under it with their trowels; single women having affairs with married men composed biting ballads that they flung at it; demolition crews hit it with wrecking balls. The contractors didn\u2019t show up but promised they would be there next week.         \n\nNo one was working harder than Maisie Adams, who was repeatedly revving up the engine of her S.U.V., hitting the gas, and slamming into the dome. Her airbags had long since deployed, the front end of her vehicle was crushed, blood was streaming down her face.         \n\nFinally the engine would run no more. Maisie sat in her vehicle sobbing.         \n\n\u201cMy family,\u201d she moaned, \u201cmy family.\u201d         \n\nHer friend Annie stepped up to the S.U.V. and opened the door, gently placing a hand on her friend\u2019s shoulder.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no use, Maisie, we\u2019ve got to face it,\u201d Annie said. \u201cWe\u2019re stuck with them.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/17/booming/under-the-summer-dome-a-vacation-horror-story.html", "date": "2013-07-17", "description": "A terrifying tale of family getaways, with apologies to Stephen King."}
