{"headline": "Judge in Texas Partly Rejects Abortion Law", "body": "\nA federal judge in Texas on Monday blocked an important part of the state\u2019s restrictive new abortion law, which would have required doctors performing the procedure to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital.         \n\nThe decision, one day before the provision was to take effect, prevented a major disruption of abortion clinics in Texas. It was a victory for abortion rights groups and clinics that had said the measure served no medical purpose and could force as many as one-third of the state\u2019s 36 abortion clinics to close.         \n\nBut the court partly upheld a second measure, requiring doctors to use a particular drug protocol in nonsurgical, medication-induced abortions. Doctors have called that protocol outdated and too restrictive.         \n\nJudge Lee Yeakel of United States District Court in Austin declared that \u201cthe act\u2019s admitting-privileges provision is without a rational basis and places a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus.\u201d         \n\nGov. Rick Perry, who has said he hopes to make abortion \u201ca thing of the past,\u201d  \n in July. It had been temporarily derailed when Wendy Davis, a Democratic state senator,  \n in the Republican-controlled Legislature. Ms. Davis is now running for governor, with abortion rights as one of her planks.         \n\nTexas officials quickly said they would appeal the decision to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, and Judge Yeakel said that \u201cat the end of the day, these issues are going to be decided definitively not by this court, but by either the Circuit or the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d         \n\nCourts in Alabama, Mississippi, North Dakota and Wisconsin have blocked similar admitting-privilege requirements as part of the continuing battles over how much states may restrict the right to abortion granted by Roe v. Wade in 1973.         \n\nMonday\u2019s ruling was hailed by the chief executive of Whole Woman\u2019s Health, a private group that had warned that it could be forced to close its clinics in McAllen, Fort Worth and San Antonio because those clinics use visiting doctors who cannot obtain admitting privileges locally. \u201cWe are very relieved,\u201d said the chief, Amy Hagstrom Miller.         \n\nIn  \n against two parts of the sweeping anti-abortion law adopted in July, abortion rights groups said that the provisions would have \u201cdramatic and draconian\u201d effects on women\u2019s access to the procedure. But lawyers for the state argued that these predictions were exaggerated and that the measures served the state\u2019s interest in \u201cprotecting fetal life.\u201d         \n\nMr. Perry responded swiftly to the decision on Monday, vowing in a written statement to appeal. \u201cWe will continue fighting to implement the laws passed by the duly elected officials of our state, laws that reflect the will and values of Texans,\u201d the statement said.         \n\nThe lawsuit did not challenge two other central provisions of the Texas law: a requirement that all abortion clinics meet the costly standards of ambulatory surgery centers, which does not take effect until September 2014, and a ban on nearly all abortions starting at 20 weeks after conception, which will take effect on Tuesday.         \n\nAnti-abortion groups, while expressing disappointment with the finding on admitting privileges, said they looked forward to an appeal and described the imminent 20-week ban as a victory.         \n\nIn three days of hearings before Judge Yeakel last week, lawyers for the state argued that it was impossible to know in advance how many clinics would have to close as a result of the admitting-privilege rule and that, in any case, the rule would not pose an \u201cundue burden\u201d on women seeking abortions, which would remain available in the state.         \n\nThe Texas solicitor general, Jonathan Mitchell, also asserted that the law served the state\u2019s interest in \u201cprotecting fetal life.\u201d         \n\nThe plaintiffs said the disputed provisions did not serve any medical interest and were intended to prevent women from exercising their constitutional right to an abortion.         \n\nThe legal challenge was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, the Center for Reproductive Rights, Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas and the owners of several other Texas clinics.
