{"headline": "The Nomad\u2019s Kitchen", "body": "\nWhen \u201cThe Hakka Cookbook\u201d appeared last year, I immediately set up a cooking date with its author, Linda Lau Anusasananan, who lives in the exotic and far-flung city of San Mateo, south of San Francisco.         \n\nThe book\u2019s subtitle is \u201cChinese Soul Food From Around the World,\u201d which could mean almost anything. The Hakkas are sometimes thought of as the Jews of China, because they\u2019re dispersed all over the place. But the Hakka people cannot even point to an original homeland (sources say \u201cnorth-central China,\u201d but that\u2019s a big place), and the word  \n roughly translates as \u201cguest families.\u201d These are itinerants, and you can find Hakkas everywhere. \u201cSome people call us dandelions, because we thrive in poor soil,\u201d says Anusasananan, who was born in California. She has also traveled widely to learn new recipes for the book.         \n\nCould it be, I wonder, that this diaspora explains in part why so many old-school Chinese restaurants are serving what appears to be Hakka cooking? Because when you leaf through \u201cThe Hakka Cookbook,\u201d you will recognize that these are the dishes that defined Chinese-restaurant cooking for nearly everyone in the United States over 40: pork with pineapple, chicken wings (or anything else) in bean sauce, braised eggplant and chow mein, for example. The cuisine, to the extent it can be defined, may be thought of as a country cousin of Cantonese.         \n\nThese dishes may not have the distinction or impact of those from Sichuan. But because they\u2019re interpreted broadly wherever they find themselves (note the addition of ketchup in many versions of pork and pineapple in the United States), they\u2019re fun, and they\u2019re easy to cook.         \n\nI settled into Anusasananan\u2019s kitchen late one gloomy January morning, and within an hour she walked me through three classic preparations:  \n (an accessible dish that makes fast work of eggplant);  \n; and  \n. These feel closer to the honest, straightforward cuisine of a group of nomads than anything I ever ate in what used to be called Chinese-American restaurants. And they translate well to home kitchens everywhere.
