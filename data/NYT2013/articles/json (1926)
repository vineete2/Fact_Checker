{"headline": "Government Gets Back to Business, but Effects of the Shutdown Linger", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The United States government sputtered back to life Thursday after President Obama and Congress ended a 16-day shutdown, reopening tourist spots and clearing the way for federal agencies to deliver services and welcome back hundreds of thousands of furloughed workers.         \n\nAcross the country, the work and play of daily life, stalled for more than two weeks, resumed at federal offices, public parks, research projects and community programs. Museums opened their doors. Federal money for preschool programs started flowing again. Scientists at the South Pole began ramping up their work.         \n\nAnd the National Zoo\u2019s  \n flickered on again (though a flood of online visitors soon crashed it).         \n\nFor Shafiqullah Noory, on his first trip to the United States from Afghanistan, the legislative deal came just when he needed it. Sitting on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, admiring the view of the Washington Monument, he said he knew why Abraham Lincoln had been an important leader.         \n\n\u201cIf you have the unity, you have the prosperity,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then everything comes after that.\u201d         \n\nIn Boston, tourists once again spilled into the Charlestown Navy Yard, the national historic park that contains the Constitution, the world\u2019s oldest commissioned warship afloat. Among them was Dorothy Bank, a retired kindergarten teacher from North Carolina, who was just about to leave Boston for a foliage tour in New England.         \n\n\u201cI was hoping it would be open; we didn\u2019t know whether it would be in time,\u201d she said, noting the uncertainty of the legislative fight in Washington. Of the ship, she said, \u201cI like it as a part of history.\u201d         \n\nIn New York City, office workers poured in and out of the mammoth building at 26 Federal Plaza in Lower Manhattan, eager to start working \u2014 and be paid \u2014 again. \u201cPut yourself in that situation,\u201d said Regina Napoli, 60, a legal administrator who had been furloughed from her job with the Social Security Administration. \u201cThe bills pile up.\u201d         \n\nWashington\u2019s Metro trains were once again packed with federal workers streaming in from suburban Maryland and Virginia, government IDs dangling from lanyards around their necks. Robert Lagana said Thursday morning that he was eager to get back to his job at the International Trade Commission.         \n\n\u201cIt beats climbing the walls, wondering where your next paycheck is going to be and how you\u2019re going to make your bills,\u201d Mr. Lagana said. \u201cThey really need to come up with a law where this never happens again.\u201d         \n\nMeanwhile, those arriving at the Environmental Protection Agency headquarters in Washington were met by none other than Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., being boisterous, as usual. \u201cI brought some muffins!\u201d Mr. Biden said as he arrived at the security desk, greeting employees with handshakes and hugs.         \n\nAnd at the White House, President Obama took a moment to speak directly to federal workers, saying: \u201cThanks for your service. Welcome back. What you do is important. It matters.\u201d         \n\nThe government\u2019s top personnel officer announced just before 1 a.m. Thursday that officials should restart normal functions \u201cin a prompt and orderly manner.\u201d Those few words were enough to kick-start the government. A memorandum from officials at the Department of the Interior encouraged returning workers to check their e-mail and voice mail, fill out their timecards and \u201ccheck on any refrigerators and throw out any perished food.\u201d         \n\nBut not everything was back to normal immediately. In Chicago, people who had been waiting to visit the Internal Revenue Service office since the shutdown began were still turned away by security. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t making a payment, they won\u2019t see you,\u201d said an officer in the lobby, who suggested they try again on Friday.         \n\nCynthia Ellis, a South Side resident, needed to get federal tax documents for a state program that helps pay her mortgage. \u201cI heard the news say all government employees are back to work,\u201d she said, clearly frustrated. \u201cThis is bad. This is really bad.\u201d         \n\nThe agreement extending federal borrowing power, hammered out at the last moment in Washington, paves the way for another series of budget negotiations. Conservative Republicans in the House and Senate vowed to renew their fight for cuts in spending and changes to the Affordable Care Act.         \n\nAcross the globe, investors shrugged at the decision by United States politicians to end the shutdown. On Wall Street, stocks were mixed in part on reports of disappointing earnings from I.B.M.         \n\nAt the Capitol, lawmakers immediately began post-shutdown posturing as they braced for another confrontation in the budget negotiations that are set to begin in the days and weeks ahead.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to assure the American people that we are not going to do this again,\u201d Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said Thursday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d         \n\nFor some people across the country, the political debate remained raw. In Oak Ridge, Tenn., where the shutdown was set to furlough about 3,600 employees at the Y-12 National Security Complex, Dean Russell said he had no plans to do away with the sign he posted at the entrance of his restaurant: \u201cMembers of Congress not welcome here.\u201d         \n\nEven in deeply conservative Tennessee, Mr. Russell said his edict applied to both parties, who are now barred from the restaurant\u2019s selection of apple, chocolate and coconut fried pies.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure the anger will pass, and I\u2019ll take it down,\u201d Mr. Russell said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll keep the sign because I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll do something again.\u201d         \n\nBut others were just happy that the shutdown was over.         \n\nAt the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, north of Los Angeles, Bonnie Clarfield, a supervisory park ranger, spent Thursday morning taking down the closed signs \u2014 16 of them in all \u2014 and cleaning up after vandals who had ripped some of them down and in some cases posted signs of their own.         \n\nShe found one handwritten sign that read, \u201cCongress Can\u2019t Shut Down the Park,\u201d while some official park signs announcing the closing were strewn in the bushes.         \n\n\u201cWe had a lot of vandalism of infrastructure,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople were frustrated, and they were taking it out on the rangers. We were doing our jobs, and they were taking it out on the messengers. I feel great today. No one\u2019s been mad at me.\u201d         \n\nFederal officials said the lingering impact of the shutdown should begin to dissipate in the coming days as agencies reopen fully and begin taking stock.         \n\nSean Hennessey, a spokesman for the National Park Service, said 85 furloughed employees were back to work in Boston. He estimated that the city\u2019s national historical sites, which include the navy yard, the Bunker Hill Monument and the downtown Faneuil Hall visitor center, lost about 55,000 visitors because of the shutdown.         \n\nThe U.S.S. Constitution Museum alone, he said, lost an estimated $7,000 per day.
