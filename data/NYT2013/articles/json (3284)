{"headline": "Some Victims of Online Hacking Edge Into the Light", "body": "\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Hackers have hit thousands of American corporations in the last few years, but few companies ever publicly admit it. Most treat online attacks as a dirty secret best kept from customers, shareholders and competitors, lest the disclosure sink their stock price and tarnish them as hapless.         \n\nRarely have companies broken that silence, usually when the attack is reported by someone else. But in the last few weeks more companies have stepped forward. Twitter, Facebook and Apple have all announced that they were attacked by sophisticated cybercriminals. The New York Times revealed its experience with hackers in a front-page article last month.         \n\nThe admissions reflect the new way some companies are calculating the risks and benefits of going public. While companies once feared shareholder lawsuits and the ire of the Chinese government, some can\u2019t help noticing that those that make the disclosures are lauded, as Google was, for their bravery. Some fear the embarrassment of being unable to fend off hackers who may still be in high school.         \n\nBut as hacking revelations become more common, the threat of looking foolish fades and more companies are seizing the opportunity to take the leap in a crowd.         \n\n\u201cThere is a \u2018hide in the noise\u2019 effect right now,\u201d said Alan Paller, director of research at the SANS Institute, a nonprofit security research and education organization. \u201cThis is a particularly good time to get out the fact that you got hacked, because if you are one of many, it discounts the starkness of the announcement.\u201d         \n\nIn 2010, when Google alerted some users of Gmail \u2014 political activists, mostly \u2014 that it appeared Chinese hackers were trying to read their mail, such disclosures were a rarity. In its announcement, Google said that it was one of many \u2014 two dozen \u2014 companies that had been targeted by the same group. Google said it was making the announcement, in part, to encourage other companies to open up about the problem.         \n\nBut of that group, only Intel and Adobe Systems reluctantly stepped forward, and neither provided much detail.         \n\nTwitter admitted that it had been hacked this month. Facebook and Apple followed suit two weeks later. Within hours after The Times published its account, The Wall Street Journal chimed in with a report that it, too, had been attacked by what it believed to be Chinese hackers. The Washington Post followed.         \n\nNot everyone took advantage of the cover. Bloomberg, for example, has repeatedly denied that its systems were also breached by Chinese hackers, despite several sources that confirmed that its computers were infected with malware.         \n\nComputer security experts estimate that more than a thousand companies have been attacked recently. In 2011, security researchers at McAfee unearthed a vast online espionage campaign, called Operation Shady Rat, that found more than 70 organizations had been hit over a five-year period, many in the United States.         \n\n\u201cI am convinced that every company in every conceivable industry with significant size and valuable intellectual property and trade secrets has been compromised (or will be shortly) with the great majority of the victims rarely discovering the intrusion or its impact,\u201d Dmitri Alperovitch, then McAfee\u2019s vice president for threat research, wrote in his findings.         \n\n\u201cIn fact,\u201d said Mr. Alperovitch, now the chief technology officer at Crowdstrike, a security start-up, \u201cI divide the entire set of Fortune Global 2000 firms into two categories: those that know they\u2019ve been compromised and those that don\u2019t yet know.\u201d         \n\nOf that group, there are still few admissions. A majority of companies that have at one time or another been the subject of news reports of online attacks refuse to confirm them. The list includes the International Olympic Committee, Exxon Mobil, Baker Hughes, Royal Dutch Shell, BP, ConocoPhillips, Chesapeake Energy, the British energy giant BG Group, the steel maker ArcelorMittal and Coca-Cola.
