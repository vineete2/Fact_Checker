{"headline": "Cries of Betrayal as Detroit Plans to Cut Pensions", "body": "\nDETROIT \u2014 Gloria Killebrew, 73, worked for the City of Detroit for 22 years and now spends her days caring for her husband, J. D., who has had three heart attacks and multiple kidney operations, the last of which left him needing dialysis three times a week at the Henry Ford Medical Center in Dearborn, Mich.         \n\nNow there is a new worry: Detroit wants to cut the pensions it pays retirees like Ms. Killebrew, who now receives about $1,900 a month.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been life on a roller coaster,\u201d Ms. Killebrew said, explaining that even if she could find a new job at her age, there would be no one to take care of her husband. \u201cYou don\u2019t sleep well. You think about whether you\u2019re going to be able to make it. Right now, you don\u2019t really know.\u201d         \n\nDetroit\u2019s pension shortfall accounts for about $3.5 billion of the $18 billion in debts that led the city  \n last week. How it handles this problem \u2014 of not enough money set aside to pay the pensions it has promised its workers \u2014 is being closely watched by other cities with fiscal troubles.         \n\nKevyn D. Orr, the city\u2019s emergency manager, has called for \u201csignificant cuts\u201d to the pensions of current retirees. His plan is being fought vigorously by unions that point out that pensions are protected by Michigan\u2019s Constitution, which calls them a contractual obligation that \u201cshall not be diminished or impaired.\u201d         \n\nGov. Rick Snyder of Michigan, a Republican who appointed Mr. Orr, signed off on the bankruptcy strategy for the once-mighty city, which has seen its tax base and services erode sharply in recent years. But the governor said he worried about Detroit\u2019s 21,000 municipal retirees.         \n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to have great empathy for them,\u201d Mr. Snyder said in an interview. \u201cThese are hard-working people that are in retirement now \u2014 they\u2019re on fixed incomes, most of them \u2014 and you look at this and say, \u2018This is a very difficult situation.\u2019 \u201d         \n\nOn Sunday, Mr. Snyder fended off the notion that the city needed a federal bailout. \u201cIt\u2019s not about just putting more money in a situation,\u201d the governor said on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on CBS. \u201cIt\u2019s about better services to citizens again. It\u2019s about accountable government.\u201d         \n\nMany retirees see the plan to cut their pensions as a betrayal, saying that they kept their end of a deal but that the city is now reneging. Retired city workers, police officers and 911 operators said in interviews that the promise of reliable retirement income had helped draw them to work for the City of Detroit in the first place, even if they sometimes had to accept smaller salaries or work nights or weekends.         \n\n\u201cDoes Detroit have a problem?\u201d asked William Shine, 76, a retired police sergeant. \u201cAbsolutely. Did I create it? I don\u2019t think so. They made me some promises, and I made them some promises. I kept my promises. They\u2019re not going to keep theirs.\u201d         \n\nVera Proctor, 63, who retired in 2010 after 39 years as a 911 operator and supervisor, said she worried that at her age and with her poor health, it would be difficult to find a new job to make up for any reductions to her pension payments.         \n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the nearest street corner where I can sell bottles of water?\u201d Ms. Proctor asked wryly. \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s going to come down to. We\u2019re not going to have anything.\u201d         \n\nOfficials overseeing Detroit\u2019s finances have called for reducing \u2014 not eliminating \u2014 pension payments to retirees, but have not said how big those reductions might be. They emphasized that they were trying to spread the pain of bankruptcy evenly.         \n\nWhen the small city of Central Falls, R.I.,  \n, a state law gave bondholders preferential treatment \u2014 effectively protecting investors even as the city\u2019s retirees saw their pension benefits slashed by up to 55 percent in some cases.         \n\nDetroit, by contrast, wants to spread the losses to investors as well as pensioners, and hopes to find cheaper ways to cover retirees through the subsidized health exchanges being created by President Obama\u2019s health care law.         \n\nBill Nowling, a spokesman for Mr. Orr, said the emergency manager\u2019s restructuring plan would treat bondholders the same as retirees in bankruptcy.
