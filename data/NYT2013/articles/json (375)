{"headline": "A More Secular Europe, Divided by the Cross", "body": "\nBRATISLAVA, Slovakia \u2014 Stanislav Zvolensky, the Roman Catholic archbishop of the Slovak capital here, was thrilled when he was invited to Brussels three years ago to discuss the fight against poverty with the insistently secular bureaucracy of the European Union.         \n\n\u201cThey let me in wearing my cross,\u201d the archbishop recalled.         \n\nIt therefore came as a rude surprise when, late last year, the National Bank of Slovakia announced that the European Commission, the union\u2019s executive arm, had ordered it to remove halos and crosses from special commemorative euro coins due to be minted this summer.         \n\nThe coins, designed by a local artist, were intended to celebrate the 1,150th anniversary of Christianity\u2019s arrival in Slovak lands but have instead become tokens of the faith\u2019s retreat from contemporary Europe. They featured two evangelizing Byzantine monks, Cyril and Methodius, their heads crowned by halos and one\u2019s robe decorated with crosses, which fell foul of European diversity rules that ban any tilt toward a single faith.         \n\n\u201cThere is a movement in the European Union that wants total religious neutrality and can\u2019t accept our Christian traditions,\u201d said Archbishop Zvolensky, bemoaning what he sees as rising a tide of militant secularism at a time when Europe is struggling to forge a common identity.         \n\nIn a continent divided by many languages, vast differences of culture and economic gaps, the archbishop said that centuries of Christianity provide a rare element shared by all of the soon-to-be 28 members of the fractious union. Croatia, a mostly Catholic nation like Slovakia, joins next month.         \n\nYet at a time when Europe needs solidarity and a unified sense of purpose to grapple with its seemingly endless economic crisis, religion has instead become yet another a source of discord. It divides mostly secular Western Europe from profoundly religious nations in the east like Poland and those in between both in geography and in faith like Slovakia.         \n\nIn nearly all of Europe, assertive secularists and beleaguered believers battle to make their voices heard. All of which leaves the European Commission, in charge of shaping Europe\u2019s common aspirations, under attack from all sides, denounced by atheists for even its timid engagement with religion and by nationalist Christian fundamentalists as an agent of Satan.         \n\nAsked about such criticism, Katharina von Schnurbein, the commission official responsible for outreach to both religious and secular groups, smiled and said, \u201cI can assure you that the European Commission is not the Antichrist.\u201d         \n\nEurope is suffused with Christianity, or at least memories of its past influence. The landscape is dotted with churches, now mostly empty, and monasteries, its ancient universities are rooted in medieval religious scholarship, and many of its national crests and anthems pay homage to God.         \n\nEven the European Union\u2019s flag \u2014 a circle of 12 yellow stars on a blue background \u2014 has a coded Christian message. Ars\u00e8ne Heitz, a French Catholic who designed the flag in 1955, drew inspiration from Christian iconography of the Virgin Mary wearing a crown with 12 stars. The same 12 stars appear on all euro coins.         \n\nThe very idea that Europe should unite began with efforts to rally Christendom in the ninth century by Charlemagne, the first ruler of the Holy Roman Empire.         \n\nThroughout its modern history, however, the \u201cEuropean project,\u201d as the Continent\u2019s current faltering push for unity is known, has sought to keep religion and the unruly passions it can stir at arm\u2019s length. The 1957 Treaty of Rome and other founding texts of what is today the European Union make no mention of God or Christianity. The Brussels bureaucracy, in its official account of Mr. Heitz\u2019s religion-tinged flag, ignores the Virgin Mary, stating instead that the 12 stars \u201csymbolize the ideal of unity, solidarity and harmony among the people of Europe.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/18/world/europe/a-more-secular-europe-divided-by-the-cross.html", "date": "2013-06-17", "description": "A commemorative euro coin with Christian imagery became the latest source of discord between the profoundly religious and those who prize a more rigid church-state divide."}
