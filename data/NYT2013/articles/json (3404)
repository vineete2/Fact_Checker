{"headline": "A Romesco Sauce That Earns Top Billing", "body": "\nBefore I ate my way around Catalonia, I assumed that the great (and sadly, late) Penelope Casas\u2019 recipe for romesco sauce, from her book \u201cThe Foods and Wines of Spain\u201d was the only one I would ever need.         \n\nDeservedly a classic, it\u2019s a rich and piquant pur\u00e9e made from sweet dried Spanish peppers along with tomato, garlic, almonds, vinegar and oil, pounded with breadcrumbs as a binder. It\u2019s marvelous on simply cooked fish, tasty stirred into seafood stews and makes a fine topping for pretty much any vegetable sturdy enough to hold its own against the thick, pungent sauce.         \n\nBut once I got to Catalonia, I met romescos of other persuasions.         \n\nSome were spicy and as runny as tomato sauce. Some were as thick as hummus and smoky with charred dried chiles. One memorably complex version, which I\u2019ve written about before, was spiked with sweet almond biscuits and enriched with hard-cooked eggs and garlic confit, then dolloped on slim green onions called calcots.         \n\nNone of this is to knock Ms. Casas\u2019s excellent recipe. Nor does it imply that when it comes to romesco sauce, anything goes. But it does give me license to take a few liberties.         \n\nThe first is to skip the sweet dried peppers, called noras, that I had always thought were essential. They are indeed very nice, but also hard to come by unless you plan ahead (not my strong suit).         \n\nInstead I substituted broiled red bell peppers. Not only do the fresh peppers add a fleshy sweetness and smokiness from the fire, they are also plentiful this time of year and begging for a noble purpose.         \n\nFor a mild kick and to intensify the smokiness, I threw in a bit of smoked hot paprika. And instead of almonds, or a mix of almonds and hazelnuts, I relied solely on hazelnuts for an earthier note.         \n\nThe result can be used nearly anywhere a brightly flavored sauce or condiment is required, and will keep in the fridge for at least a week.         \n\nIn her various books, Ms. Casas recommends using romesco on grilled tuna, as a sauce for shrimp and lobster or slicked over potatoes and green beans in a substantial salad. Here, I\u2019ve tossed it with quickly blanched broccoli, which is crisp and light, but hearty enough to stand up to this very bold sauce.
