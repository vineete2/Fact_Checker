And, as the Mexican saying goes: Sin ma\u00edz, no hay pa\u00eds.         \n\nWithout corn, there is no country.         \n\n\u201cOur people spent thousands of years growing corn, harvesting corn and making it into masa and tortillas every single day,\u201d said Hugo Ortega, the Mexico City-born chef at  \n. \u201cIt is truly in our bones.\u201d         \n\nMuch of the corn in Mexico is eaten in the form of masa, soft corn dough that is the base of the tortilla, the tamal, the gordita, the sope, the tlacoyo \u2014 the list seems endless. The fresh, earthy taste of masa is bigger than tacos; bigger, even, than Mexico.         \n\n\u201cOne of the only ways to define Latin American cooking, which covers such an enormous area, is with masa,\u201d said Maricel Presilla, the author of \u201cGran Cocina Latina: The Food of Latin America.\u201d         \n\nCorn is something Ms. Presilla has spent a great deal of time thinking about. Chocolate and chiles, potatoes and tomatoes and other foods native to Latin America have all been absorbed into global kitchens. But masa remains stubbornly, proudly Latin, the clay that molded the food traditions of a continent.         \n\nThere are two distinct types of corn in Latin America: elote is sweet, tender corn that North Americans recognize as corn on the cob: ma\u00edz is hard, so-called flint corn that is dried after harvest and then ground into flour.         \n\nIt is only when ma\u00edz is \u201cnixtamalized\u201d that the basis for a great taco \u2014 a great tortilla \u2014 is born.         \n\nIn Mexico, masa for tortillas is always made from nixtamal, dried corn that has been treated with an alkali, like ash or slaked limestone (called cal in Mexico), that softens its texture and vastly improves its nutritional profile. Nixtamalization also changes the flavor and aroma of corn in ways that are addictive and indelible but almost impossible to describe.         \n\n\u201cNixtamalized corn smells like rain on hot pavement,\u201d Ms. Presilla said.         \n\nLesley T\u00e9llez, a writer in Elmhurst, Queens, who graduated from culinary school in Mexico City and now leads food tours there, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a mineral aroma, from the volcanic-rock millstones used to grind the corn. The masa smells fresh and grainy, with none of the sourness or sweetness of packaged tortillas.\u201d         \n\nNixtamalizing has been documented as far back as 1500 B.C. and was traditionally a tedious process: soaking, draining, rinsing, peeling and grinding, all by hand. The same process is used to make hominy, the swollen white kernels that fill a bowl of pozole, and mote, whole kernels that are simmered and roasted all along the Andean highlands, from Ecuador to Chile.         \n\nNot coincidentally, Ms. T\u00e9llez lives near the only New York City tortilleria, or tortilla factory, that nixtamalizes and grinds its own corn.  \n supplies masa and tortillas to most of New York\u2019s top taquerias and restaurants: Dos Toros, the  \n restaurants in Brooklyn and Manhattan and many more.         \n\nStill, last week she pulled out her  \n, a tabletop electric mill that she lugged home from Mexico, to make her own masa for tlacoyos \u2014 masa cakes, thicker than tortillas and with a pronounced corn flavor, stuffed with refried beans. She said it was the best batch she had ever made: airy, soft and light, made with red and white corn kernels she brought from Mexico. (Tortilleria Nixatamal uses corn grown in the United States. ) \u201cWhen you smell fresh masa, you just want to bury your face in it,\u201d she said.         \n\nOutside Mexico, the corn for masa is dried and peeled but not nixtamalized, making for a fluffy, mild dough. It is also ubiquitous across Latin America. In Guatemala\u2019s ancient creation myth, humans were shaped from masa by the gods; today, Guatemalan cooks make masa-stuffed tamales colorados, ruddy with achiote oil.         \n\nModern Salvadorans still, as a staple, eat pupusas, which are thick hand-shaped masa patties filled with cheese or refried beans or meat; Venezuelans and Colombians share arepas, fragrant buns that are irresistible slathered with butter and cheese or as an accompaniment to soups and stews, for soaking up the juices.         \n\nIn the Caribbean, where corn arrived via the Spanish conquistadors, masa for tamales is sweetened with local sugar and studded with fruit. And in Mexico, the month of September, corn harvest time, is marked by tamales stuffed with a special masa of fresh, milky corn.         \n\nThroughout Latin America, Ms. Presilla said, working with masa is considered women\u2019s work. It took a crew of women to keep the line moving at the \nstall at a science fair in Queens two weeks ago. (In 2011, Solber Pupusas won the coveted Vendy award, given to the city\u2019s best food vendors.) The workers are known as pupuseras, said Cesar Fuentes, who owns Solber Pupusa with his mother, Reina Bermudez, and her husband, Rafael Solber. \u201cGirls learn from their mothers, and they learned from their mothers.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/02/dining/masa-offers-the-kernels-of-a-culture.html", "date": "2013-09-30", "description": "Many foods native to Latin America have been absorbed into global kitchens, but masa remains stubbornly, proudly Latin."}
