{"headline": "At One With the Land, and Each Other", "body": "\n \n         \n\nLoren and Laurel Appleman of Johnstown, Neb. (population 50), were married in 1974, when she was a high school junior. He raises beef cattle, corn and soybeans on their 3,000-acre farm while she runs a quilt shop. They have seven adult children. A condensed and edited version of our conversation follows.         \n\n \n         \n\nLaurel: My family moved to Johnstown when I was about 12. My father took me to get some milk at the Applemans\u2019 dairy farm, which is where I met Loren and his sisters.         \n\nLoren: I was 15. We saw each other a lot in church.         \n\n \n         \n\nLaurel: By the time I was 14 I was in class with one of his sisters, so we would spend time and he would be there and before long I was spending more time with him than with her.         \n\nLoren: The first time I noticed her I guess was when I went to visit her family\u2019s home for a meal. She was about 14. Within months we started talking about marriage, but it was a year before I asked her folks for their permission to marry.         \n\n \n         \n\nLaurel: On my 16th birthday he asked. My dad said, \u201cWell, you\u2019ll need a house,\u201d thinking that might slow us down. That was in August. By October we had a house and on Nov. 7, 1974, we were married.         \n\nLoren: She had a long weekend break from high school and went back after our honeymoon in Wyoming on Tuesday or Wednesday. The school said she needed an admission slip to get back in class. She wondered who she was supposed to get it from \u2014 her husband or her folks.         \n\nLaurel: I wasn\u2019t the only girl in high school who was married, but I was the only one who wasn\u2019t pregnant.         \n\n \n         \n\nLoren: The wife made her dress and made my sport coat, too. I had gotten a small inheritance from my grandfather than I used to buy the trailer we lived in.         \n\nLaurel: Actually, my mother made my dress, but I did make his jacket. It was this ugly burgundy and cream plaid, but he actually wore it.         \n\n \n         \n\nLoren: When I was a junior in high school I bought shares of a farm that my grandfather had with two other partners, so I took that responsibility on pretty early. We purchased the trailer and moved it onto the farm. Two years later we moved into a house on the farm, and it\u2019s where we are today.         \n\n \n         \n\nLaurel: When we decided to get married I doubled up on my classes so I could graduate early.         \n\n \n         \n\nLoren: By the time she graduated we had our first. Her name was Susan, but she died of crib death. Here was Laurel, just 17 and we already had buried a baby.         \n\nLaurel: We woke up on Father\u2019s Day and she was dead of sudden infant death syndrome. I don\u2019t remember a whole lot, but we were there for each other. We were busy. Loren was still dairying with his dad; that still had to be done twice a day.         \n\n \n         \n\nLoren: Her sisters and a group of breastfeeding mothers, and we attended church every Sunday.         \n\nLaurel: I worked a bit after Susan passed. I needed a change so I got a part-time job as a cashier in a farm store.         \n\n \n         \n\nLaurel: By New Year\u2019s Day I was in the hospital and had a miscarriage. I told the nurse I didn\u2019t think I would ever have children, but Bryan was born a year and a month later.         \n\n \n         \n\nLoren: We disagreed some on discipline. I was a little bit more physical with them, which upset her, but we worked through that. I came to realize that a little thump on the head wasn\u2019t necessary.         \n\nLaurel: I don\u2019t have any problem with a swat on the hiney, but his swats were harder. I think he could see that it upset me and he bowed to my request. He was a little hardened. I was an easy sell, so I think we gave them a good balance. We home-schooled them, but in the beginning we didn\u2019t agree on that.         \n\n \n         \n\nLoren: I thought there was still a stigma to home schooling. There was the idea that the kids wouldn\u2019t get along with other kids or adults and that they wouldn\u2019t know how to interact in a social setting. But it worked. I\u2019ve seen kids from the schools and they don\u2019t know how to interact with anybody, and our kids can talk with people from any generation.
