{"headline": "Council Bill Aims to Limit Use of E-Cigarettes as Their Popularity Grows", "body": "\nThe City Council is seeking to add electronic cigarettes to New York\u2019s ban on smoking in public places.         \n\nThe city has long prohibited smoking in workplaces, and since 2002 under the administration of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has extended the ban to bars and restaurants, parks, beaches and plazas. Now, a councilman and the city\u2019s health commissioner say that  \n \u2014 battery-powered, smokeless nicotine-delivery systems \u2014 in public places, and that this poses a threat to public health and may encourage a new generation to smoke.         \n\nThe councilman James Gennaro, one of the lead sponsors of the proposal to ban e-cigarettes in public places, and the commissioner, Dr. Thomas A. Farley, said that a loophole in current law allowing for electronic cigarettes was sowing confusion.         \n\nPeople are lighting up electronic cigarettes in restaurants, creating conflict with other patrons and waiters who have to mediate, they said. Mr. Gennaro said children who could not differentiate between regular and electronic smoking were getting the message that smoking is socially acceptable.         \n\n\u201cWe see these cigarettes are really starting to proliferate, and it\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d Mr. Gennaro said on Wednesday. \u201cI get reports of people smoking cigarettes in public libraries. Certainly, they\u2019re becoming more common in restaurants and bars.\u201d         \n\nBut the makers of electronic cigarettes say that they are safe because they do not burn tar or tobacco, and they signaled their readiness on Wednesday to fight the proposed ban vigorously. They say the e-cigarettes are a good alternative to regular smoking for people who cannot quit.         \n\n\u201cI think you have to ask yourself, if you make it just as inconvenient to use an electronic cigarette as a tobacco cigarette, people are just going to keep smoking their Marlboros,\u201d said Craig Weiss, president and chief executive of NJoy, one of the larger electronic cigarette companies. \u201cThat does not benefit the public.\u201d         \n\nA public hearing before the Council is set for next Wednesday, and the Council is expected to vote on the proposal on Dec. 19, at its last scheduled voting meeting before new members and a new mayor take office.         \n\nNew York and Chicago are among the first large cities to consider banning e-cigarettes. New Jersey, North Dakota and Utah have recently included electronic cigarettes in their bans on smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants, according to the American Nonsmokers\u2019 Rights Foundation.         \n\nSo have dozens of localities, including Pittsfield, Mass.; Savannah, Ga.; Ketchum, Idaho; and Suffolk County, on Long Island.         \n\nElectronic cigarettes are designed to imitate conventional cigarettes by using a heating element to vaporize a flavored liquid and, typically, nicotine. The vapor is inhaled, a process sometimes called \u201cvaping\u201d rather than smoking, and transmits the nicotine that smokers crave.         \n\nDr. Farley and other advocates of a ban say that electronic cigarettes have not been well studied and should be treated warily because their potential hazards are unknown. \u201cWhile more study is needed on electronic cigarettes, waiting to act is a risk we should not take,\u201d he said.         \n\nBut Mr. Weiss said that to argue against something based on lack of knowledge was not a reasonable way to make public policy.         \n\n\u201c \u2018Without the information, I\u2019m going to regulate\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s not an appropriate thing to do,\u201d he said.         \n\nKaren Blumenfeld, executive director of an antismoking group called  \n, said on Wednesday that the claim that electronic smoking was safe reminded her of the \u201c'40s, \u201850s and \u201860s, when  \n, it would calm your nerves.\u201d         \n\nOpponents of e-cigarettes also argue that they are a gateway to conventional cigarettes,  \n         \n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found that the percentage of middle- and high-school students who use electronic cigarettes more than doubled from 2011 to 2012. In a statement with that report, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the C.D.C. director, said teenagers who used e-cigarettes could become addicted to nicotine and go on to smoke regular cigarettes.         \n\nBut Mr. Weiss, the NJoy executive, said: \u201cThere is no scientific data to support the argument that e-cigarettes are a gateway to smoking. On the contrary, there is a significant amount of research that indicates e-cigarettes can be a novel approach for moving smokers away from tobacco cigarettes.\u201d         \n\n \n and seems to have a hip image. One electronic cigarette company, Blu, has been acquired by the tobacco company Lorillard.         \n\nThe former Facebook president Sean Parker and Peter Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal, have invested in Njoy. Mr. Weiss said that he saw Mr. Parker\u2019s and Mr. Thiel\u2019s investment as evidence not so much of trendiness as of a prediction that electronic cigarettes were \u201cparadigm shifting\u201d in the way of successful Internet companies.         \n\nAt several bars in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, on Wednesday evening, patrons and bartenders said they were not bothered by electronic cigarettes.         \n\nLisa Graziano, 39, a bartender at the Charleston, said she enjoyed smoking e-cigarettes, even though she abhors regular cigarettes.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m very much against smoking, but with these there\u2019s no smoke,\u201d she said, blowing billows of sweet-smelling steam after drawing on a thin, black tube with a tip that glowed lavender.         \n\n\u201cI remember when Bloomberg passed the original ban, I was so happy,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t even smoke but I love the hookah\u201d \u2014 a type of electronic cigarette. \u201cYou push the button and you get the flavor.\u201d         \n\nTo emphasize her point, she smoked it next to a pregnant woman, who said she was not bothered.         \n\n\u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t bother anyone around here, and that\u2019s the point,\u201d Ms. Graziano said. \u201cI despise regular cigarettes.\u201d         \n\nDavid Slifkin, 45, the Charleston\u2019s manager, said he did not think business would be affected by any ban. \u201cThe people who smoke those in here, it\u2019s less than 2 percent,\u201d he said.         \n\nCory Sterling, 27, a bartender at the Gibson, called the proposed ban \u201ca little silly.\u201d He added, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to bother any of the customers, and when it\u2019s cold and no one wants to stand outside, it\u2019s a good alternative.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/28/nyregion/bill-would-restrict-electronic-cigarettes-in-new-york.html", "date": "2013-11-27", "description": "Fearing that e-cigarettes are a gateway to conventional cigarettes, and that they may pose health hazards, the New York City Council is trying to ban their use in public places."}
