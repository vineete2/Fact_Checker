{"headline": "My Personal \u2018Storage Wars\u2019", "body": "\nWhen my husband, Mike, died of lung cancer five years ago at age 36, I was a very sad widow. I cried a lot. I took to bed. But eventually, I decided I\u2019d had enough.         \n\nMike had a storage space. We\u2019d recently moved to an apartment with our two small children but were planning on buying a house, so the space was for all the stuff we didn\u2019t have room for now but would most likely want later. Mike loved to buy things at auctions and flea markets and faraway foreign bazaars \u2014 deal-hunting was his favorite sport \u2014 so most of it was his.         \n\nI couldn\u2019t bring myself to go through the space. So I set up a credit-card auto payment. The price of avoidance was $79 a month. But then, about a year ago, my credit card expired.         \n\nOn one hand, I finally felt strong enough to sort through the last of his things. But in four years, I hadn\u2019t missed any of the things in that storage space, only the person who put them there. I wanted to just let it go.         \n\nIt was time to deal. And so I decided that I would \u2014 by walking away from it.         \n\nPeople thought I was nuts. Aren\u2019t you worried you\u2019ll give up something important? Haven\u2019t you seen \u201cStorage Wars\u201d?         \n\nBut if there was anything important in there, I would have needed it sometime in the past four years. I have never seen \u201cStorage Wars,\u201d but I know Mike, and he would never have left a shoe box of cash in a storage space.         \n\nKind friends offered to go through the space for me. I politely declined. As it was, nothing in the space had meaning. The second I saw or heard about any of it, all of it would.         \n\nWhat was there anyway? I did a quick mental scan. A martini set someone gave us for our wedding. Bouncy seats and play mats my kids had long since outgrown. Mike\u2019s copies of \u201cThe Black Swan\u201d and Saul Bellow and Isaiah Berlin. His haggled-over finds. If I really thought hard, I could maybe remember one or two of the items we bought in Bangkok or Barcelona. But I didn\u2019t \u2014 and don\u2019t \u2014 want to think that hard.         \n\nI asked myself: Could there be anything in there you would later regret giving up? Yes. Our wedding video. I called my mother and asked if she still had a copy. She did.         \n\nOn the final day of the month, I drove to the storage space. It was cold and raw and rainy. I started to have doubts. Was this fair to Mike? Was not going through this stuff somehow not honoring him?         \n\nI went to the office and told the clerk the whole story.         \n\n\u201cSo you want to forfeit the space without clearing out its contents?\u201d he asked.         \n\n\u201cRight,\u201d I said. But I wasn\u2019t really sure. Once they cut the lock, I could still take a peek. Maybe that was what I should do. I fumbled through my purse for a death certificate.         \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in there?\u201d said the only other person in the office, a muscled guy in his mid-30s in jeans, a black skullcap and black nylon jacket. I gave him my rough guesses.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you 100 bucks for all of it,\u201d he said. His name was John, and he had a space there, too. His car wouldn\u2019t start in the rain, so he was waiting in the office for a friend to come get him.         \n\nClearly he\u2019d seen \u201cStorage Wars.\u201d         \n\nI was elated. It wasn\u2019t the $100; it was that Mike would have loved this. I told John that he had a deal and that I really should have been paying him.         \n\nJohn reached for his wallet. I noticed \u201cM.O.B.\u201d tattooed on his hand.         \n\nJohn became sheepish. \u201cI got that a long time ago. I was young. It was stupid. It\u2019s Money . . . Over. . . . \u201d He averted his eyes.         \n\n\u201cGot it,\u201d I said.         \n\nJohn handed me five 20s, and I told him I hoped he\u2019d find something great in there and make back five times his money. I knew he thought it was just a coincidence that his car wouldn\u2019t start, that he was just a guy with a tattoo he regrets. \u201cBut you\u2019re not,\u201d I told him. \u201cToday you\u2019re a gift from the universe.\u201d         \n\nWe hugged goodbye and John said he\u2019d call me if he found anything that seemed important. (I never heard from him.)         \n\nBy the time I left the storage space, the rain had cleared up and the sun was peeking out from behind a cloud. Really.         \n\nI drove home giddy, telling Mike what happened in my head. More than anything, he would have loved this story. Except, I realized, for one part.         \n\nI took John\u2019s first offer. I could have gotten at least $150.
