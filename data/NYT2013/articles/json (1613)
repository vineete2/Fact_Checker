{"headline": "Church Whistle-Blowers Join Forces on Abuse", "body": "\nThey call themselves  \n, a newly formed cadre of priests and nuns who say the Roman Catholic Church is still protecting sexual predators.         \n\nAlthough they know they could face repercussions, they have banded together to push the new pope to clean house and the American bishops to enforce the zero-tolerance policies they adopted more than a decade ago.         \n\nThe group began organizing quietly nine months ago without the knowledge of their superiors or their peers, and plan to make their campaign public this week. Most in the steering group of 12 have blown the whistle on abusers in the past, and three are canon lawyers who once handled abuse cases on the church\u2019s behalf. Four say they were sexually abused as children.         \n\nTheir aim, they say, is to support both victims and fellow whistle-blowers, and identify shortcomings in church policies. They hope to help not just minors, but also adults who fall prey to clergy who exploit their power for sex. They say that their motivation is to make the church better and safer, and to show the world that there are good priests and nuns in the church.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve dedicated our lives to the church,\u201d the Rev. John Bambrick, a priest in the Diocese of Trenton, said at a meeting of the group last week in New York. \u201cHaving sex offenders in ministry is damaging to our ministry.\u201d         \n\nThe group has sent a  \n to Pope Francis asking him to take several significant steps to heal victims and restore the church\u2019s credibility: revoke all oaths of secrecy, open the files on abuse cases, remove from office any bishops who obstructed justice and create an international forum for dialogue between survivors and church leaders.         \n\nThe Catholic Church in the United States put in place a zero-tolerance policy and a host of prevention programs after the abuse scandal peaked in 2002. Each year the bishops commission an audit of abuse cases, and this year\u2019s survey, released May 9, found the fewest allegations and victims since the audits began in 2004.         \n\nBut the whistle-blowers\u2019 group contends that vigilance is necessary because some bishops are violating the zero-tolerance policies, and abusive clergy (who now number 6,275, according to the bishops\u2019 count of those accusations that they deem credible) still have access to children. They point to the revelations in the last month that a priest in Newark who was a convicted sex offender restricted by a court order from working with children had been ministering in a Catholic parish in Trenton, taking confessions from children and going on weekend youth retreats.         \n\nSeveral of the whistle-blowers have been vocal about that priest, the Rev. Michael Fugee. Along with some New Jersey politicians, they have called for the resignation of the archbishop of Newark, John J. Myers. They fault Archbishop Myers not only for failing to restrict Father Fugee, but also for appointing him to help direct the education of priests in the archdiocese.         \n\nArchbishop Myers\u2019s spokesman said the archbishop was unaware of the priest\u2019s activities, and is cooperating with an investigation by the Bergen County prosecutor. Father Fugee left the ministry, and on Monday was arrested on charges that he violated a judicial order by having contact with minors. The bishop of Trenton, David M. O\u2019Connell, removed another priest and two youth ministers from the parish in Trenton where Father Fugee worked with youth.         \n\nThe Newark case, as well as the  \n and convictions of church officials in Philadelphia and Kansas City, convinced the whistle-blowers\u2019 group that they have work to do despite the optimistic picture in the bishops\u2019 audits. They do not consider the bishops\u2019 audits credible because they are based on self-reporting.         \n\nThe group discussed the latest scandal in Newark at a meeting last week in Manhattan. At that meeting,  \n traveled from Brooklyn; Sister Maureen Paul Turlish from Delaware; \nfrom Peekskill, N.Y.; and Father Bambrick, Msgr. Kenneth E. Lasch and Robert Hoatson, a former priest, came from New Jersey. The Rev. James Connell joined in by speakerphone from Sheboygan, Wis. (The Rev. Thomas P. Doyle \u2014 perhaps the church\u2019s most famed whistle-blower \u2014 recently joined the group but could not attend.) They had been conducting their weekly meetings by conference calls, and it was only the second time most of them had met face to face.         \n\nEach member has a history of standing up publicly on behalf of abuse victims, but until last year most of them did not know of one another. A Catholic laywoman, Anne Barrett Doyle, who lives in Boston, suggested they should meet. She is the co-director of  \n, a Web site and advocacy group that is building a database of documents on clergy abuse cases, and a co-worker, Suzy Nauman, had been \n who had helped expose predators or had spoken out.
