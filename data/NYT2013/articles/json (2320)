{"headline": "A.D.H.D. Seen in 11% of U.S. Children as Diagnoses Rise", "body": "\nNearly one in five high school age boys in the United States and 11 percent of school-age children over all have received a medical diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, according to new data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.         \n\nThese rates reflect a marked rise over the last decade and could fuel growing concern among many doctors that the A.D.H.D. diagnosis and its medication are overused in American children.         \n\nThe figures showed that an estimated 6.4 million children ages 4 through 17 had received an A.D.H.D. diagnosis at some point in their lives, a 16 percent increase since 2007 and a 41 percent rise in the past decade. About two-thirds of those with a current diagnosis receive prescriptions for stimulants like Ritalin or Adderall, which can drastically improve the lives of those with  \n but can also lead to addiction, anxiety and occasionally psychosis.         \n\n\u201cThose are astronomical numbers. I\u2019m floored,\u201d said  \n, a pediatric neurologist in New Haven and a professor at the Yale School of Medicine. He added, \u201cMild symptoms are being diagnosed so readily, which goes well beyond the disorder and beyond the zone of ambiguity to pure enhancement of children who are otherwise healthy.\u201d         \n\nAnd even more teenagers are likely to be prescribed medication in the near future because the \n plans to change the definition of A.D.H.D. to allow more people to receive the diagnosis and treatment. A.D.H.D. is described by most experts as resulting from abnormal chemical levels in the brain that impair a person\u2019s impulse control and attention skills.         \n\nWhile some doctors and patient advocates have welcomed rising diagnosis rates as evidence that the disorder is being better recognized and accepted, others said the new rates suggest that millions of children may be taking medication merely to calm behavior or to do better in school. Pills that are shared with or sold to classmates \u2014 diversion long tolerated in college settings and gaining traction in high-achieving high schools \u2014 are particularly dangerous, doctors say, because of their health risks when abused.         \n\nThe findings were part of a broader  \n of children\u2019s health issues, taken from February 2011 to June 2012. The agency interviewed more than 76,000 parents nationwide by both cellphone and landline and is currently compiling its reports. The New York Times obtained the raw data from the agency and compiled the results.         \n\nA.D.H.D. has historically been estimated to affect 3 to 7 percent of children. The disorder has no definitive test and is determined only by speaking extensively with patients, parents and teachers, and ruling out other possible causes \u2014 a subjective process that is often skipped under time constraints and pressure from parents. It is considered a chronic condition that is often carried into adulthood.         \n\nThe C.D.C. director, Dr. Thomas R.  \nFrieden, likened the rising rates of stimulant prescriptions among children to the overuse of pain medications and antibiotics in adults.         \n\n\u201cWe need to ensure balance,\u201d Dr. Frieden said. \u201cThe right medications for A.D.H.D., given to the right people, can make a huge difference. Unfortunately, misuse appears to be growing at an alarming rate.\u201d         \n\nExperts cited several factors in the rising rates. Some doctors are hastily viewing any complaints of inattention as full-blown A.D.H.D., they said, while pharmaceutical advertising emphasizes how medication can substantially improve a child\u2019s life. Moreover, they said, some parents are pressuring doctors to help with their children\u2019s troublesome behavior and slipping grades.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous push where if the kid\u2019s behavior is thought to be quote-unquote abnormal \u2014 if they\u2019re not sitting quietly at their desk \u2014 that\u2019s pathological, instead of just childhood,\u201d said  \n, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and the author of \u201cHow Doctors Think.\u201d         \n\nFifteen percent of school-age boys have received an A.D.H.D. diagnosis, the data showed; the rate for girls was 7 percent. Diagnoses among those of high-school age \u2014 14 to 17 \u2014 were particularly high, 10 percent for girls and 19 percent for boys. About one in 10 high-school boys currently takes A.D.H.D. medication, the data showed.         \n\nRates by state are less precise but vary widely. Southern states, like Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, South Carolina and Tennessee, showed about 23 percent of school-age boys receiving an A.D.H.D. diagnosis. The rates in Colorado and Nevada were less than 10 percent.         \n\nThe medications \u2014 primarily Adderall, Ritalin, Concerta and Vyvanse \u2014 often afford those with severe A.D.H.D. the concentration and impulse control to lead relatively normal lives. Because the pills can vastly improve focus and drive among those with perhaps only traces of the disorder, an A.D.H.D. diagnosis has become a popular shortcut to better grades, some experts said, with many students unaware of or disregarding the medication\u2019s health risks.
