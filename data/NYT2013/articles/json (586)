{"headline": "Seeing Opening, House G.O.P. Pushes Delay on Individual Mandate in Health Law", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 House Republican leaders on Tuesday seized on the Obama administration\u2019s one-year delay of a mandate for larger employers to offer health insurance or face penalties, demanding the same postponement for the mandate on individual insurance purchases and promising a series of showdowns aimed at dividing Democrats from the White House.         \n\nAfter more than two years of voting repeatedly and unsuccessfully to repeal the health care law, Republicans believe they are getting traction thanks to what they see as the Obama administration\u2019s self-inflicted wound over the employer mandate.         \n\nHouse leaders began devising strategies that would most likely start this month with multiple votes, the first to codify the one-year delay on the employer mandate, then another to demand a delay on the individual mandate. They calculate that Democrats would first vote to back the administration\u2019s decision, and would then have a hard time opposing the second measure. Some Republicans raised the possibility that a provision to repeal the individual mandate could be attached this fall to legislation raising the government\u2019s statutory borrowing limit.         \n\n\u201cIs it fair for the president of the United States to give American businesses an exemption from his health care law\u2019s mandates without giving the same exemption to the rest of America? Hell no, it\u2019s not fair,\u201d Speaker John A. Boehner told a closed-door gathering of House Republicans on Tuesday, according to those present.         \n\nSome Democrats were also dismayed by the White House\u2019s actions. Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee and an author of the health law, questioned whether Mr. Obama had the authority to unilaterally delay the employer mandate.         \n\n\u201cThis was the law. How can they change the law?\u201d he asked.         \n\nFor its part, the White House continued to look flat-footed on the issue. After an almost surreptitious evening announcement of the delay last week, posted on the Treasury Department\u2019s Web site, the White House is declining to send a representative to a House hearing on the decision that is scheduled for Wednesday. An administration official might testify next week.         \n\nIn the postponement of the employer mandate, Republicans see an opportunity to sound a populist alarm against a health care law that many Americans remain uncertain about.         \n\n\u201cI never thought I\u2019d see the day when the White House, this president, came down on the side of big business, but left the American people out in the cold as far as this health care mandate is concerned,\u201d said Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader.         \n\nRepresentative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, said such criticism was absurd. The Republican position on many issues is to \u201chug big business while leaving the American people out in the cold,\u201d he said.         \n\nBut on this issue, Republicans have new policy arguments to add to the political attacks that have preceded nearly 40 votes to repeal all or part of the health care law. The White House announced on July 2 that it would delay, until 2015, a requirement that larger employers offer coverage to employees.         \n\nOn Friday, the administration said that it would delay a requirement for federal and state insurance exchanges to verify whether people seeking subsidies qualify for them.         \n\nThe subsidies, expected to average more than $5,000 a year for each person who qualifies, are meant to help low- and middle-income people pay for insurance. However, the subsidies are not supposed to be available to people who have access to affordable coverage from employers.         \n\nIn 2014, employers will not be required to report what coverage, if any, they provide to employees. In the absence of such information from employers and other sources, the government said, exchanges can generally rely on what applicants say.         \n\nThat, too ,became a rallying cry for Republicans.         \n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s decision to use the honor system to hand out subsidies, I think, exposes taxpayers to massive fraud and abuse,\u201d Mr. Boehner said.         \n\nWhite House officials said that even without the employer mandate, subsidies would not be handed out blindly to individuals. But Mr. Levin conceded that \u201cthere will be some reliance on the honesty of people,\u201d with audits, random checks or other safeguards to verify what people report.         \n\nRepublicans insisted that Democratic unity on the health care law would begin to crack. Mr. Boehner told House Republicans that the law was a \u201crickety old stool,\u201d standing on the individual mandate, the employer mandate and a few other provisions.         \n\n\u201cThe president himself kicked one of those legs out from under the stool last week,\u201d he told lawmakers, according to aides. Delaying the individual mandate would kick out another leg, he added.         \n\nBut at least for now, Democrats did not show signs of abandoning the individual mandate.         \n\n\u201cIf you take away the individual mandate, that would dismantle a core concept of universal coverage,\u201d said Representative Jim McDermott of Washington, the senior Democrat on the Ways and Means subcommittee on health. \u201cWe have been waiting for national health care coverage since Teddy Roosevelt, for more than 100 years. One more year is not the end of the earth.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/10/us/politics/house-gop-pushes-delay-on-individual-mandate-in-health-law.html", "date": "2013-07-09", "description": "After years of trying to repeal the health care law, Republicans believe they are getting traction thanks to what they see as a self-inflicted wound by the Obama administration."}
