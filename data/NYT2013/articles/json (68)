{"headline": "In One School, Students Are Divided by Gifted Label \u2014 and Race", "body": "\nIT is just a metal door with three windows, the kind meant to keep the clamor of an elementary school hallway from piercing a classroom\u2019s quiet. Other than paint the color of bubble gum, it is unremarkable.         \n\nBut the pink door on Room 311 at  \n on the Upper West Side represents a barrier belied by its friendly hue. On one side are 21 fourth graders labeled gifted and talented by New York City\u2019s school system. They are coursing through public school careers stamped accelerated.         \n\nAnd they are mostly white.         \n\nOn the other side, sometimes sitting for reading lessons on the floor of the hallway, are those in the school\u2019s vast majority: They are enrolled in general or special education programs.         \n\nThey are mostly children of color.         \n\n\u201cI know what we look like,\u201d Carolyn M. Weinberg, a 28-year veteran of P.S. 163, said of the racial disparities as she stood one day in the third-floor hallway between Room 318, where she and a colleague teach a fourth-grade general education class, and the one where Angelo Monserrate teaches the gifted class, Room 311.         \n\n\u201cI know what you see,\u201d said Ms. Weinberg.         \n\nThere are 652 students enrolled at P.S. 163 this year, from prekindergarten through fifth grade. Roughly 63 percent of them are black and Hispanic; whites make up 27 percent; and Asians account for 6 percent.         \n\nThis reflects the flavor of the neighborhood, and roughly matches the New York City school system\u2019s overall demographics.         \n\nYet in P.S. 163\u2019s gifted classes, the racial dynamics of the neighborhood, the school itself and the school system are turned upside down.         \n\nOf the 205 children enrolled in the nine gifted classes, 97, or 47 percent, are white; another 31 of the students, or 15 percent, are Asian. And a combined 65 students, or 32 percent, are black and Hispanic.         \n\nIn the 21 other classes that enroll the school\u2019s remaining 447 students, only 80, or 18 percent, are white.         \n\nThe disparities are most apparent in the lower grades.         \n\nOf the 24 students in Karen Engler\u2019s kindergarten gifted class, one is black and three are Hispanic. Ayelet Cutler\u2019s first-grade gifted class has 21 students, one of them black and two Hispanic. There are two blacks and two Hispanics among the 26 students in Athena Shapiro\u2019s second-grade gifted class.         \n\nOn a recent morning, a line of Ms. Cutler\u2019s students moved from the classroom to the corridor, ahead of the general education class of Linda Crews. A string of mostly white faces and then a line of mostly black and Hispanic ones walked down the hall of a school named for a New York politician who sought to end inequities in education: Alfred E. Smith.         \n\nIt was 11:25 a.m., and the classes wound their way to the cafeteria, a cavernous room at the school\u2019s western edge. Once there, the children sat with those in their own class, each one at a separate long white table that, for a moment, froze the divisions.         \n\nFor critics of New York City\u2019s  \n, that image crystallizes what they say is a flawed system that reinforces racial separation in the city\u2019s schools and contributes to disparities in achievement.         \n\nThey contend that gifted admissions standards favor middle-class children, many of them white or Asian, over black and Hispanic children who might have equal promise, and that the programs create castes within schools, one offered an education that is enriched and accelerated, the other getting a bare-bones version of the material. Because they are often embedded within larger schools, the programs bolster a false vision of diversity, these critics say, while reinforcing the negative stereotypes of class and race.         \n\nDespite months of repeated requests, the city\u2019s Education Department would not provide racial breakdowns of gifted and talented programs and the schools that house them. But the programs tend to be in wealthier districts whose populations have fewer black and Hispanic children, and far more children qualify for them in affluent districts than in poorer ones.
