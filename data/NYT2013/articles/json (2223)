{"headline": "Finding Peace During Noisy Trips", "body": "\nIT\u2019S CALLED THE QUIET ZONE. Introduced this month by AirAsia X, a budget airline based in Malaysia, this eight-row oasis offers soft lighting and a promise: no children younger than 12 allowed. The cost of keeping them out? An extra $11 to $36 a ticket.         \n\nThe notion of segregating children on planes has long inspired debate, even satire. On April Fools\u2019 Day, the Canadian airline WestJet joked that it was creating child-free cabins by putting kids in a \u201cspecial V.I.P.\u201d area of the plane. An accompanying  \n showed children scooting along a luggage belt and being stored in a plane\u2019s cargo hold.         \n\nBut there is a deeper story here, one that underlies the hullabaloo over children\u2019s areas. It\u2019s about silence, and how different cultures value or don\u2019t value it \u2014 a nuance that becomes obvious when we travel.         \n\nMusic blaring from headphones, booming cellphone conversations and garrulous passengers are as much a part of travel today as removing your shoes at the airport. And the din has plenty of people \u201cannoyed, stressed, oppressed,\u201d as Mike Goldsmith, the former head of the acoustics group at the National Physical Laboratory in England and author of \u201cDiscord: The Story of Noise,\u201d put it to me. \u201cThe hearing system evolved in part as a warning system, so there is a natural tendency to classify noise as threat,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, more importantly, noise is an intrusion, a challenge to our rights over our immediate environment.\u201d         \n\nIn the travel milieu, noise has become so commonplace that it\u2019s increasingly being managed with rules, like cellphone bans on buses and quiet cars on trains. The new AirAsia X  \n says it all: pay for silence, or prepare for cacophony.         \n\nMy own survival strategies involve noise-canceling headphones, nasty looks and sleeping pills (not necessarily in that order). But they make me feel at best antisocial and, at worst, mean. I needed help. So I turned to some people who know a thing or two about silence, from a Buddhist monk to an anthropologist who specializes in public space and culture. Given how easily my thoughts are shattered by noise, I knew I needed to start my quest for quiet with someone who has the discipline of, well, a monk.         \n\nAnd so I began with Andy Puddicombe, who was ordained at a monastery in Tibet and a decade later returned to London to teach meditation to the wider world. Technically that makes him a former monk, but one could argue that it takes more mental stoicism to find peace in London than in the Himalayas. I expected him to suggest that travelers block out unwelcome noise by closing their eyes and breathing deeply. To my surprise and delight, he didn\u2019t.         \n\n\u201cDenial of what\u2019s going on just doesn\u2019t work,\u201d said Mr. Puddicombe, who discusses the benefits of meditation in his book \u201cGet Some Headspace\u201d and on his Web site,  \n. Attempting to ignore the loudmouth next to you by breathing deeply is what Mr. Puddicombe calls a classic meditation-related mistake \u2014 and one that\u2019s likely to frustrate you even more as you struggle to focus on your breath instead of the noise. Besides, there\u2019s not much you can do about a plane or train buzzing with sounds. What you can change, of course, is how you respond.         \n\n\u201cThe sound \u2014 that in itself isn\u2019t the problem,\u201d Mr. Puddicombe said. \u201cThe problem is the resistance in our mind.\u201d In other words, don\u2019t sit there fuming about the shouting child and his ineffectual parents. Mr. Puddicombe said your discomfort is not the shouting, it\u2019s the gap between reality (the noisy child) and what you want the situation to be (quiet). What Mr. Puddicombe calls \u201cmindfulness meditation\u201d (essentially being in the present moment) can help bridge the space between reality and desire. \u201cIt\u2019s letting go of what we want it to be,\u201d he said, \u201cand moving closer to acceptance of what is happening right now.\u201d (Hint: this can also be applied to matters of work, health, love.)         \n\nHow wonderfully sane. But how to do it?         \n\nFirst, simply acknowledge that you\u2019re frustrated (in your head, not by lobbing a shoe). \u201cWhen you look at resistance it starts to lose its intensity,\u201d Mr. Puddicombe said. Then, listen to the sound. Don\u2019t blame the noisemakers. Just listen to the sound.         \n\n\u201cIf you give that your full attention,\u201d Mr. Puddicombe said, \u201ceventually the mind will get bored of it.\u201d He gave as an example being on an hourlong train ride next to someone with iPod music loud enough for you to hear. Your mind simply won\u2019t stay focused on the music for an hour, Mr. Puddicombe said.
