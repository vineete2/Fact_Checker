{"headline": "A Question of Forgiving", "body": "\nThis past week,  \n, having announced that he was seeking the office of city comptroller, spoke with countless members of the news media to say the same thing: that his sexual indiscretions showed a regrettable lack of judgment; that  \n (a phrase he appears to have used for nearly a decade, only now registering its personal relevance); that as comptroller, he would do more than ensure that \u201cthe paper clips are counted\u201d; and that he is ready now to ask for \u201cforgiveness\u201d in order to serve as a city functionary.         \n\nIt is unclear what \u201cforgiveness\u201d really has to do with supporting him; forgiveness is for intimates. Anyone voting for Mr. Spitzer would need simply to arrive at the conclusion that the skills he would provide as a fund manager and watchdog outweigh the recklessness he displayed in handling his erotic urges.         \n\nBut at least some portion of the electorate seems to have processed Mr. Spitzer\u2019s transgressions personally.  \n was the headline of a column on  \n by Ruth Davis Konigsberg, who wrote that she had \u201cloved Eliot Spitzer,\u201d that friends became prosecutors because of him and that now those friends \u201cmay never look at public service the same way again.\u201d         \n\nThe column coincided with an interview on \u201cMorning Joe\u201d in which Mika Brzezinski faced Mr. Spitzer looking as disappointed in him as if he were a close friend who had neglected to visit after gallbladder surgery. One significant way that his candidacy seems different from Anthony D. Weiner\u2019s in the aftermath of his own scandal is that the former congressman was never inspiring enough to leave many people feeling so betrayed. I suspect that some women feel cheated by Mr. Spitzer for playing so egregiously against type: the well-to-do, progressive Ivy League lawyer with the  \n \u2014 the \u201cLean In\u201d reader\u2019s ideal eHarmony matchup \u2014 isn\u2019t supposed to conduct himself like a bond trader three weeks out of the Sigma Chi house.         \n\nIt seems worth examining the forgiveness meme in historical context. In 1960, Norman Mailer, then 37 and a future mayoral candidate, was arrested for and pleaded guilty to stabbing his wife Adele in the back and abdomen at a party at the couple\u2019s Upper West Side apartment. The attack left Mrs. Mailer in critical condition at University Hospital on Second Avenue, where she told doctors that she had injured herself falling on glass. (As it happened, Mailer had been arrested the previous week on a charge of disorderly conduct after a dispute over a bill, for $7.60, at Birdland.)         \n\nNine years later, Mailer ran for mayor, winning 5 percent of the vote. Most remarkably, he did so with the support of Bella Abzug and Gloria Steinem, a key campaign adviser who offered her house for \n. It\u2019s hard to imagine that prominent feminists weren\u2019t disgusted by Mailer\u2019s history of domestic violence, but it\u2019s doubtful they thought about it in terms of something that they should or shouldn\u2019t forgive. Clearly, they were able to compartmentalize, putting aside serious personal failings for the sake of a shared vision of urban revitalization.         \n\nThere are plenty of negative things to be said about Eliot Spitzer, but it can\u2019t be said that he does not have a vision of what the world ought to look like, and what it ought to look like is a world in which Wall Street wields considerably less influence.         \n\nThe city\u2019s longest-serving comptroller in the 20th century, Harrison J. Goldin, a successful public servant who helped shepherd the city out of its financial crisis in the 1970s and \u201980s, bears certain marked similarities to the former governor. Impressively intelligent \u2014 Mr. Goldin was a top-ranked student at the Bronx High School of Science and went on to Princeton and law school at Yale \u2014 he stood for things, had a reputation for unchecked arrogance and ambition and used the role of the comptroller\u2019s office as expansively as Mr. Spitzer plans to.         \n\nMr. Goldin used the power of the city\u2019s pension funds to push American companies to divest of interests in apartheid South Africa. This spurred other cities to follow suit. He hired outside accountants who revealed the city\u2019s fiscal troubles to begin with. When he reviewed the efficiency of city agencies, he sought to improve those that were inefficient. Having noted that high-performing schools had high parental involvement, for instance, he promoted the notion of more parental participation. The idea that food, left over in restaurants, ought to be distributed to the poor was one that grew out of his office.         \n\nWhen I called Mr. Goldin last week and asked him what characteristics a good comptroller must possess, he kept returning to the matter of \u201csocial conscience.\u201d         \n\nThe Manhattan borough president, Scott M. Stringer, Mr. Spitzer\u2019s opponent, is a very good candidate hardly devoid of a conscience. But in some sense, Mr. Spitzer\u2019s flawed history is precisely his advantage, insomuch as it has left the media addicted to everything he says and thinks. Arguably, a vote for Mr. Spitzer is a vote for the elevated profile of a certain set of beliefs embraced with not nearly enough enthusiasm in the Democratic Party, particularly at the local level, where politicians all too often comport themselves as the financial industry\u2019s handmaidens.         \n\nBeyond Senator Elizabeth Warren, it\u2019s hard to think of another major political figure who has taken on class warfare as passionately as Mr. Spitzer, a rich person, who for whatever reason seems to harbor a certain fierce antipathy toward lots of other rich people.         \n\nIt\u2019s not as if anyone looks at Christine C. Quinn and says, \u201cThank goodness; at long last a crusader against the banks.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/nyregion/a-question-of-forgiving.html", "date": "2013-07-12", "description": "Eliot Spitzer is finding that political comebacks are tricky after a major scandal \u2014 but history shows that voters, even Gloria Steinem, can get past certain transgressions."}
