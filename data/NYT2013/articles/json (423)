In S\u00e3o Paulo, the nation\u2019s largest city, protesters blocked roads leading to the airport and thousands rallied at a downtown plaza to protest a measure backed by conservative legislators, known as the gay cure, that would allow psychologists to treat homosexuality as a form of mental illness.         \n\nThe protests continued even though one of the main groups that had been behind the original demonstrations here said that it would not call for any more marches in S\u00e3o Paulo. The group indicated that it had won the concessions on bus fares it had demanded and that it was concerned that some members of allied groups, like left-wing political parties or social movements, had been singled out and beaten up at the demonstrations.         \n\n\u201cWe won the fight, so we are going to take time to think about what to do next,\u201d said Rafael Siqueira, a member of the group, Passe Livre, which had pushed for the rollback of a bus fare increase.         \n\nIn Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, 1,000 people attended the funeral of Marcos Delefrate, an 18-year-old who died after being struck by a car on Thursday. Military police officers escorted the mourners, and the cavalry positioned itself in front of the cemetery.         \n\nThe protests claimed a second victim on Friday, Cleonice Vieira, 51, a street cleaner in the city of Bel\u00e9m in the Amazon. Brazilian news organizations reported that she had died of a heart attack after a tear-gas canister exploded nearby.         \n\nAs the protests continued, the national development bank, known as BNDES, announced that it had approved more than $1 billion in loans to expand the metro system in S\u00e3o Paulo, the city where the bus fare increase set off the initial protests. And in Bras\u00edlia, the Finance Ministry said it had created an inspector to review allegations of corruption, one of the main issues that has driven countless thousands to the streets in recent days.         \n\nBut many protesters said the measures fell far short of what was needed.         \n\n\u201cThey have been promising lots of things for many years, but it doesn\u2019t go beyond that,\u201d said Jeniffer Novaez, 18, a physical therapist. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they understand what is really happening here, but it\u2019s been many years and we are thirsty. We want everything, and we want it now.\u201d         \n\nAnother protester, Bruna Santana, 22, a student, said the government was not serious in its response. \u201cThey only want to shut us up,\u201d she said.
