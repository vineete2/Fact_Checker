{"headline": "City Reverts to Its Days of Hobbling", "body": "\nIt was New York City\u2019s clunky, unsophisticated emblem of 1980s law and order \u2014 part security tool, part public shaming device \u2014 fastened to the front wheels of offending vehicles like the mark of Cain.         \n\nBut two decades after the immobilizing wheel clamp all but disappeared from the city\u2019s streets, the device, known as a boot, is coming back.         \n\nThe  \n plans to replace most traditional towing with a so-called booting program by the end of the summer, affixing the devices onto vehicles whose owners owe more than $350 in outstanding fines.         \n\nThough city marshals, sheriffs or the police will still be allowed to tow cars violating certain city parking rules \u2014 including cases where a car is blocking traffic or creating another safety hazard \u2014 the wheel clamp is expected to predominate.         \n\nThe new system will rely on a \u201cself-releasing boot,\u201d developed by the company PayLock, which secured a sole-source contract with the city last year.         \n\nDrivers who pay by phone are given a code to unlock the boot on site, the city said. They are then allotted 48 hours to return the boots to one of about a dozen locations in the city. Residents can also request that someone else come to remove the boot. If the city receives no contact from a car\u2019s owner, the vehicle will be towed 48 hours after the boot is placed.         \n\nOfficials said the change should drastically reduce the time that drivers have to wait before getting their vehicles back \u2014 and, often, the speed with which the city is paid.         \n\nBut the shift seems to trade on a possible psychological tug: With a disabled car still in eyesight, and not banished to a faraway tow yard, will the lure of on-the-spot payment prove too powerful to ignore?         \n\n\u201cI won\u2019t say the language you might use, but you say, \u2018What the hell happened to my car?\u2019\u00a0\u201d David M. Frankel, the city\u2019s finance commissioner, said of the towing system. \u201cYou can still be angry at the fact that you have to pay your parking tickets, but compared to getting it towed, it\u2019s no comparison.\u201d         \n\nThe boots were  \n in New York by Mayor Edward I. Koch as a complement to car towing. Booting teams remained active into the early 1990s, according to the Finance Department, but the program was problematic. Drivers were often able to break free from the lock, leaving it behind in an empty space. \u201cYou find a piece of boot, and the car is gone,\u201d a city official was quoted as saying in 1986, as the Koch administration tested six different boots, attempting to find the appropriate model for New York.         \n\nThe boot\u2019s ineffectiveness was later shown in  \n of \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d as Homer Simpson drove his shackled car, haltingly, in Manhattan, damaging his vehicle and inspiring the city\u2019s wrath as he slogged through traffic.         \n\nBut last year, the Bloomberg administration began a small-scale pilot program, operating first in Brooklyn and Queens. From June through December, the city booted more than 4,200 cars, Mr. Frankel said. In an average year, more than 110,000 vehicles are towed. The department said that it was unclear if revenue would increase as a result of the booting, but \u201cwe do not anticipate any decrease.\u201d         \n\nDawn Jeanty, 47, from Coney Island, Brooklyn, whose car was booted in Flatbush on Wednesday morning, said she preferred the system to towing. She declined to pay immediately, though, hoping to reduce her fines after a visit to the Finance Department office on Joralemon Street. \u201cIt\u2019s bad enough you already have outstanding tickets,\u201d she said. \u201cIt takes a little load off of you.\u201d         \n\nCity marshals have expressed concerns about the new system, citing the hindrance of leaving cars on the street and the logistics of upending a business model that has long been in operation.         \n\nBut Michael Woloz, a spokesman for the New York City Marshals Association, said that the group was \u201choping to be integrated into the program shortly.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThis is a change for New York,\u201d he said, \u201cand we are ready for the change.\u201d         \n\nThe testing period was not without hiccups. In February, the Department of Investigation announced the arrest of a PayLock employee on charges of bribe-receiving and petit larceny after he was said to have accepted $100 from an offender.         \n\nRobert Sinclair Jr., a spokesman for AAA New York, questioned whether the new boots would be able to deter the most brazen scofflaws. \u201cThis is New York,\u201d he said. \u201cSomebody with a good welding torch can cut these suckers off in 60 seconds.\u201d         \n\nA spokesman for the Finance Department said that while a few drivers had broken out of the clamp during the pilot program, officials did not expect boot security to be a widespread issue.         \n\nOn a recent weekday, the surgical efficiency of the current operation was clear. A towing crew roamed with a city marshal in East New York, Brooklyn, typing the license plates of parked vehicles into a hand-held device. The screen spit back one of two messages: \u201cnot towable\u201d or \u201cpossible tow.\u201d The typical job took no more than a few minutes, once a plate was confirmed as belonging to a violator, as cars were affixed to a truck and taken away.         \n\nFor the tow workers \u2014 and, soon, the booting squad \u2014 interactions with the public can be fraught. One man, whose sport utility vehicle was being towed near Van Siclen and Belmont Avenues, emerged from his apartment around 11:20 a.m. in nothing but his boxers. \u201cWhy are you towing the car?\u201d he shouted, sprinting over to the marshal. He owed more than $420, he was told. He nodded, and collected his things from the vehicle.         \n\nSome were less accepting of their fates. Scrambling to barter as a crew member lowered a long bar toward the driver\u2019s side door, a man \u2014 apparently the proprietor of a nearby appliance store \u2014 presented the marshal with an offer.         \n\nIf the city knocked $100 off of the total owed, the man said, \u201cyou\u2019ll get any electrical supply you need.\u201d         \n\nThe marshal declined.
