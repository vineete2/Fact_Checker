A top veteran of two mayors, he is an incisive mechanic of government, with ideas and shards of ideas all but falling out of his pockets.         \n\nHe grooves on peel-your-skin-back candor, and he hasn\u2019t heard that yet from the candidates. \u201cWe need to hear their aspirational goals, so we\u2019ll know when they fall short,\u201d he says. \u201cOtherwise they\u2019ll reach a big decision and fold like cheap rugs in humid weather.\u201d         \n\nHe cackles.         \n\nThe latter is Mr. Robins\u2019s favorite saying, of the printable variety. His is a proud liberal of the city-that-works variety. After serving as deputy schools chancellor under Mayor Edward I. Koch, he ran the Office of Operations for Mayor David N. Dinkins as a more-or-less permanent eye over the shoulders of commissioners. He turned schools into after-hour community centers, removed abandoned cars from parks and revolutionized that bible of good management, the Mayor\u2019s Management Report. \u201cIt affirms government,\u201d he says, \u201cto make public the good, the bad and the ugly.\u201d         \n\nTo talk with the candidates is to hear excellent ideas, like affordable housing, inclusionary zoning and a plan to keep tuition at public colleges and universities down with tax proceeds from legalized marijuana.         \n\nBut their narratives leave a sense of overarching vision half expressed.         \n\nUnder Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, Mr. Robins says, \u201cour city\u2019s become a trading post; when you talk of public housing, public hospitals, public parks \u2014 with elite exceptions \u2014 too many are subpar.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIf the wealthy, the unions, the elite nonprofits, all feel entitled to more,\u201d he continued, \u201cwe crowd out the common good.\u201d         \n\nMr. Robins would begin with law and order, which is to say wage theft and worker safety. To wander our neighborhoods is to see laborers, restaurant employees and food delivery workers without basic protections.         \n\nMuch of this is illegal. Officials say state and federal government must help. Mr. Robins shakes his head. Treat it as you would crime. Wage theft alone runs close to $1 billion a year.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten comfortable seeing low-wage workers as sharecroppers,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen was the last time the mayor blew a blood vessel about the systematic violation of wage protections?         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s theft. Stop it.\u201d         \n\nNew York cut tens of millions of dollars from the libraries in the past five years \u2014 and spent twice as much on the High Line, a park that ignited a luxury real estate price explosion in Chelsea.         \n\nNew Yorkers do not lack for self-regard. Mr. Robins, born here and living still in Brooklyn, would play to this: \u201cWhy do Chicago and Boston keep libraries open 50 hours a week while New York doesn\u2019t do five days a week?\u201d Mr. Robins asks. \u201cLet\u2019s aspire to 60 hours.\u201d         \n\nTo pay for this, he would commence a slaughter of sacred cows. He would extend the business tax to insurance companies, currently exempt for no good reason. That would reap $300 million, the Independent Budget Office says. He would end the $17 million property tax abatement for Madison Square Garden and its wealthy teams. He would toll bridges to help mass transit. He would end property tax exemptions for elite nonprofit entities, like Columbia and New York Universities, and our big hospitals; they offer grand salaries and oversee vast real estate empires yet skip free of taxes.         \n\n\u201cThe Daily News wrote about Mount Sinai Hospital giving mortgage forgiveness to doctors,\u201d he says. \u201cWe leave money on the table, and yet we are pushing an austerity agenda and putting our parks in the wood chipper.\u201d         \n\nTourism is at historic highs; travelers pile into hotels in far-flung neighborhoods. Would anyone notice another 1 percent on the rooms tax?         \n\nHe turns his eyes to labor. Municipal contracts expired years ago. Ask candidates, desperate for labor\u2019s hand, about their negotiating plans and their mumble sounds like this: Iwon\u2019tnegotiateinpublic. Iwon\u2019t. Iwon\u2019t.         \n\nMr. Robins rolls his eyes. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to talk about retroactive pay, they have to talk about paying into health care,\u201d he says. \u201cThen talk about sick time.\u201d         \n\nThat advocates had to pummel Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker and Democratic candidate for mayor, to obtain a bare handful of sick days for low-wage workers justifiably dogs her campaign to this day.         \n\nMunicipal workers suffer no such problems. Most cash out when they retire, getting at least one day of pay for every three of unused sick days. So a progressive benefit turns into an expensive going-away present.         \n\nThere\u2019s more. Many teachers, firefighters and police officers get automatic raises; lower-paid workers, who labor for District Council 37, do not. In the hierarchy of need, Mr. Robins suggests starting there. \u201cD.C. 37 workers are the McDonald\u2019s workers of the labor force,\u201d he says. \u201cA mayor could say: \u2018We have to start making distinctions within our aspirational framework.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nMr. Robins has more provocations than I have words in this column. \u201cCandidates are too afraid to step beyond the water\u2019s edge,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat\u2019s exciting is when you really take risks.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/20/nyregion/provocative-proposals-for-new-york-missing-from-the-campaign-trail.html", "date": "2013-08-19", "description": "A veteran of two administrations details the peel-your-skin-back candor he wants to hear from the mayoral candidates."}
