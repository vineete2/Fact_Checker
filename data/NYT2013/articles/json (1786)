It\u2019s a Job for the Kale Crusader!", "body": "\nPARIS \u2014 The French do not know from kale.         \n\nWhile legions of American chefs, diners and health gurus have turned it into  \n and a sought-after superfood, their Gallic counterparts do not understand the leafy green vegetable. Even worse, they do not seem interested.         \n\nThey cannot even agree on what to call it. There are at least five terms for kale, and the technical name, chou fris\u00e9 non-pomm\u00e9, translates unappetizingly as \u201ccurly headless cabbage.\u201d         \n\nIn a nation that loves just about every comestible its terroir can put forth, kale is a reminder of the dietary deprivation of World War II that made boiled cabbage an unpleasant fixture of the dinner table. Even here in the city that tends to embrace trends it considers tr\u00e8s Brooklyn, kale (so ubiquitous in Brooklyn that it could be named the borough\u2019s official vegetable) evokes the classic Parisian shrug.         \n\nBut suddenly, there are stirrings of a movement to make France pay attention, led by a 29-year-old American who has transformed herself into the Joan of Arc of kale. This crusader for crucifers, Kristen Beddard, found herself without a job in 2011 after quitting as an Ogilvy & Mather account manager in New York to follow her husband to Paris. She also found herself without a beloved food she had eaten since her childhood in Pittsburgh.         \n\n\u201cI went to so many farmers and restaurants, showing them photos of kale,\u201d Ms. Beddard said. \u201cNo one had any idea what I was talking about. One night I was out to dinner with my husband and I said, \u2018What if I try to bring kale to Paris?\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nWorking from her apartment on a shoestring budget, she has created The Kale Project, complete with a  \n that dutifully reports kale sightings. Despite her minimal French, she has passionately pitched kale to chefs and vegetable farmers.         \n\n\u201cI knew deep down that if I could get farmers to grow it, I could create a kale community in France,\u201d Ms. Beddard said. \u201cMy mission is to make kale as common as lettuce.\u201d         \n\nShe is under no illusion that she will earn a living from kale, and is not making any money at the moment. But if her kale project turns a profit one day, she would be delighted.         \n\nShe has her work cut out for her.         \n\n\u201cWhy would the French ever care about this large, coarse-leaved cabbage?\u201d asked Sana\u00eb Lemoine, a French writer in Brooklyn who helped found a food blog called  \n (and cooks a lot with kale). \u201cThey don\u2019t need magical vegetables or superfoods. They already have a tradition of eating balanced meals. In a strange way, kale is superfluous.\u201d         \n\nIn Ms. Beddard\u2019s encounters with the French, some have bridled at this young American who presumes to instruct them about an ancient piece of their culinary heritage. One of France\u2019s largest food distributors laughed at her, she said, when she proposed that he ask his farmers to plant kale.         \n\nBut with the help of a quiet charm and an advertising executive\u2019s enthusiasm, she has chalked up some modest victories.         \n\nThey include organizing several kale events at small restaurants and cafes, including what was billed as Paris\u2019s first official kale evening at the upscale bistro  \n last year. She supplies Loustic, an espresso and lunch bar in the Marais, every day with kale salads, kale chips and kale pesto that she makes herself.         \n\nAt her suggestion, a young chef at  \n, a hip new bistro in a working-class neighborhood in eastern Paris, is using kale to garnish t\u00eate de veau and to anchor salads with fresh apple sauces and Comt\u00e9 cheese. Next month, Ms. Beddard will help create cocktails with kale juice at  \n, the club in central Paris designed by the filmmaker David Lynch.         \n\nThe first farmer to embrace her project was Hermione Boehrer, who has started growing organic baby kale and selling it for 25 euros a kilogram (about $15 a pound) every Sunday at the outdoor organic food market on Boulevard Raspail. She says she always sells out.         \n\nMs. Beddard met her at the market, after noticing that mustard greens, an oddity in France, were for sale at her stand. The two women struck up a conversation. \u201cIt sounds cheesy, but it was almost like fate,\u201d Ms. Beddard said.         \n\nMs. Boehrer, 60, is gray-haired, deeply tanned and deadly serious. She lives alone, without indoor plumbing or electricity, on a two-acre farm near Coulommiers, about a 90-minute drive from Paris. Ms. Beddard provided her with seeds that she had brought from England for a curly-leaf kale called Halbhoher Gr\u00fcn Krauser. The first crop last year was eaten by insects, but this year\u2019s harvest has been a smashing success.         \n\nMs. Beddard also contacted  \n, the high-end farmer who grows more than 1,500 varieties of nonorganic fruits and vegetables outside Paris. He had grown kale, several years ago, but it did not sell. Prodded by Ms. Beddard, he began growing kale again, and recently it was selling briskly at an outdoor market here.         \n\nWhen Ms. Beddard has questions about soil content or predatory insects, she consults her uncle, Thomas Beddard, the founder of  \n, a large organic produce operation on the East Coast of the United States. And she has become a walking Wikipedia entry on the history and culture of kale.
