{"headline": "Eastern States Press Midwest to Improve Air", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In a battle that pits the East Coast against the Midwest over the winds that carry dirty air from coal plants, the governors of eight Northeastern states plan to petition the  \n on Monday to force tighter air pollution regulations on nine Rust Belt and Appalachian states.         \n\nThe East Coast states, including New York and Connecticut, have for more than 15 years been subject to stricter air pollution requirements than many other parts of the country. Their governors have long criticized the Appalachian and Rust Belt states, including Ohio, Kentucky and Michigan, for their more lenient rules on pollution from coal-fired power plants, factories and tailpipes \u2014 allowing those economies to profit from cheap energy while their belched soot and smog are carried on the prevailing winds that blow across the United States.         \n\nAll the governors on the petition are Democrats. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican and a potential presidential candidate in 2016, has not signed it.         \n\nThe petition comes the day before the Supreme Court is to hear arguments to determine the fate of a related E.P.A. regulation known as the \u201cgood neighbor\u201d rule. The regulation, officially called the  \n, would force states with coal pollution that wafts across state lines to rein in soot and smog, either by installing costly pollution control technology or by shutting the power plants.         \n\nEven if the regulation is upheld, the Eastern governors are seeking stronger constraints on pollution from the Midwest and Rust Belt states.         \n\nThe Obama administration issued the \u201cgood neighbor\u201d rule, which would apply chiefly to power plants in 27 states east of Nebraska, half of the country, in 2011, but the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit  \n, ruling that the E.P.A. had not followed the  \n when it calculated how to assign responsibility for cross-state air pollution. The rule is part of President Obama\u2019s growing effort to use E.P.A. regulations to crack down on coal pollution.         \n\nIn the case before the Supreme Court, the E.P.A. argues that the cross-state air rule, which it is required to issue under the Clean Air Act of 1990, is necessary to protect the health and environment of downwind states. The utilities and 15 states on the other side argue that the rule, as written by the Obama administration E.P.A., gives the agency too much regulatory authority and places an unfair economic burden on the states.         \n\nThe Supreme Court is allowing 90 minutes to listen to arguments, rather than the traditional 60 minutes, signaling that the justices have a particularly keen interest in the case.         \n\nLike the petition from the Northeastern governors, the court case reflects the growing anger of East Coast officials against the Appalachian states that mine coal and the Rust Belt states that burn it to fuel their power plants and factories. Coal emissions are the chief cause of global warming and are linked to many health risks, including asthma and lung disease.         \n\nGov.  \n of Connecticut, who is leading the effort by East Coast governors to crack down on out-of-state pollution, called it a \u201cfront-burner issue\u201d for his administration.         \n\n\u201cI care about this because it\u2019s put Connecticut at an economic disadvantage,\u201d Mr. Malloy said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re paying a lot of money to remove these compounds from the air. That money is reflected in higher energy costs. We\u2019re more than willing to pay that, but the states we\u2019re petitioning should have to follow the same rules.\u201d         \n\nMr. Malloy said that more than half the pollution in Connecticut was from outside the state and that it was lowering the life expectancy of Connecticut residents with heart disease or asthma. \u201cThey\u2019re getting away with murder,\u201d Mr. Malloy said of the Rust Belt and Appalachia. \u201cOnly it\u2019s in our state, not theirs.\u201d         \n\nJudging by history, environmental advocates said the governors\u2019 petition had a good chance of success. In 2000, for example, the E.P.A. granted petitions from Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York and Pennsylvania to require 12 states, including Ohio and Indiana, to control nitrogen emissions from nearly 400 large coal- and gas-fired power plants.         \n\nIn the last three years, Republicans and the coal industry have campaigned aggressively against the E.P.A. regulations as they have accused Mr. Obama of waging a \u201cwar on coal.\u201d         \n\nAcross the Midwest, many lawmakers see the regulations as a serious economic threat. Representative Fred Upton, the Michigan Republican who is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, has said that the cross-state air rule will force families to face \u201cthe threat of higher power bills, less reliability and job losses.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/09/us/politics/eastern-states-press-midwest-to-improve-air.html", "date": "2013-12-09", "description": "The governors of eight Northeastern states plan to petition the Environmental Protection Agency to force stricter air pollution rules on nine Rust Belt and Appalachian states."}
