{"headline": "It\u2019s Not Everyone\u2019s Time to Buy a Home", "body": "\nMy family and I are renters, and most of the time that feels fine. But last week I found myself in a state of temporary panic when I read \n from the financial journalist Felix Salmon: \u201cJohn Paulson: if you rent, buy. If you own, buy a second home.\u201d         \n\nWhen I read it, I immediately felt anxious. I recognized the feeling. It\u2019s the feeling you get when you think you have to act on something right away or you\u2019ll miss out. After all, if John Paulson, the guy who made \u201c \n,\u201d was saying I should rush out and buy a house, I\u2019d better get on it!         \n\nAfter allowing myself to get all worked up about this, I did what I\u2019ve done several times before. I pulled out a piece of paper and a pencil and worked through the emotions and the numbers. In the end, I was reminded of something incredibly important.         \n\nJohn Paulson doesn\u2019t know me or my situation.         \n\nThere is absolutely no reason I should be making decisions based on something he said. The same is true for any other \u201cexpert\u201d who decides to share his guess about what he thinks will happen next in the housing market.         \n\nThe same holds true for the other three people who just happened to express similar concerns to me about buying right now. Two were convinced that if they didn\u2019t buy a house now, they\u2019d be priced out of the market, and maybe they will be. But I heard that argument a lot in 2005-6.         \n\nThen there was the third conversation I had.         \n\nIt\u2019s time for this person to downsize to a different home. The children have all moved out and the house just takes too much work. But even though it\u2019s the right decision to sell now (given her individual situation) and buy a smaller home, a decision has been made to wait because the news, the forecasts and even the guesses are implying that the house could be worth substantially more sometime in the next 12 months.         \n\nThis is madness!         \n\nBuying a home is one of the biggest financial decisions that most of us will make in our lifetimes. And yet it\u2019s often a decision in which the person with the most knowledge about what makes the most sense gets overlooked: You.         \n\nThere\u2019s a simple way to fix this problem. As I was reminded last week, all it takes is a piece of paper, a pencil and some time. So if you\u2019re struggling with this decision to buy (or sell), take a minute to think through these questions and write down the answers, because I suspect you\u2019ll need to refer back to them the next time somebody decides to share what he thinks will happen with housing market. This list is not meant to be prescriptive. It is meant to get you thinking about something other than forecasts and guesses.         \n\n\u25a0 Can you afford it, and do you have enough saved for a down payment? Make sure you include the cost for things like property taxes, homeowner association fees and utilities.         \n\n\u25a0 Can you qualify for a loan? If the answer right now is no, then you can stop torturing yourself, because it doesn\u2019t matter if the market is about to take off. You can\u2019t buy a house.         \n\n\u25a0 How long do you plan to live in the home? There\u2019s some debate about the minimum time you should live in a home for it to be worthwhile, but if it\u2019s less than five years, forget about it.         \n\n\u25a0 What guess are you making about housing prices? It is a painful reality that the one variable that makes a huge difference in this decision is unknowable. What is going to happen to housing prices in the short term  \n. But for your own sanity, just assume that housing prices will continue to increase by about the long-term average of inflation, or 3 percent. You really can\u2019t afford to buy a house if the decision depends solely on what the house might one day be worth.         \n\nThe answers to all of these questions will depend on you and your individual situation. And that\u2019s the point. Hopefully it\u2019s clear now how ridiculous it is to buy a house based on some stranger\u2019s advice.         \n\nThrough this process, you may discover that  \n, and that\u2019s O.K., too. But these questions can also help end your anxiety around what is probably the biggest financial decision you\u2019ll make. Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s worth a piece of paper, a pencil and a little time?
