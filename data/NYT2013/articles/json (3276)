{"headline": "Hand of U.S. Is Seen in Halting General\u2019s Rise in Mexico", "body": "\nAs  \n\u2019s military staged its annual Independence Day parade in September, spectators filled the main square of Mexico City to cheer on the armed forces. Nearly 2,000 miles away in Washington, American officials were also paying attention.         \n\nBut it was not the helicopters hovering overhead or the antiaircraft weapons or the soldiers in camouflage that caught their attention. It was the man chosen to march at the head of the parade, Gen. Mois\u00e9s Garc\u00eda Ochoa, who by tradition typically becomes the country\u2019s next minister of defense.         \n\nThe Obama administration had many concerns about the general, including the  \n\u2019s suspicion that he had links to  \n and the Pentagon\u2019s anxiety that he had misused military supplies and skimmed money from multimillion-dollar defense contracts.         \n\nIn the days leading up to Mexico\u2019s presidential inauguration on Dec. 1, the United States ambassador to Mexico, Anthony Wayne, met with senior aides to President  \n to express alarm at the general\u2019s possible promotion.         \n\nThat back-channel communication provides a rare glimpse into the United States government\u2019s deep involvement in Mexican security affairs \u2014 especially as Washington sizes up Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who is just two months into a six-year term. The American role in a Mexican cabinet pick also highlights the tensions and mistrust between the governments despite proclamations of cooperation and friendship.         \n\n\u201cWhen it comes to Mexico, you have to accept that you\u2019re going to dance with the devil,\u201d said a former senior D.E.A. official, who requested anonymity because he works in the private sector in Mexico. \u201cYou can\u2019t just fold your cards and go home because you can\u2019t find people you completely trust. You play with the cards you\u2019re dealt.\u201d         \n\nA former senior Mexican intelligence official expressed similar misgivings about American officials. \u201cThe running complaint on the Mexican side is that the relationship with the United States is unequal and unbalanced,\u201d said the former official, who, like others interviewed for this article, spoke anonymously to discuss diplomatic and security exchanges. \u201cMexico is open with its secrets. The United States is not. So there\u2019s a lot of resentment. And there\u2019s always an incentive to try to stick it to the Americans.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nWashington\u2019s concerns about General Garc\u00eda Ochoa \u2014 which several officials cautioned were not confirmed \u2014 come as both governments grasp for new ways to stem the illegal flows of drugs, guns and money across their borders.         \n\nUnder Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s predecessor, Felipe Calder\u00f3n, cooperation between the two governments had expanded in ways once considered unthinkable, with American and Mexican agents conducting coordinated operations that resulted in the capture or killing of several dozen important cartel leaders. But while Washington highlighted the record numbers of arrests, the stepped-up campaign created a wave of violence in Mexico that left some 60,000 people dead.         \n\nThe devastating death toll has Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, 46, a former governor, promising to move his country\u2019s fight against organized crime  \n, focusing more on reducing violence than on detaining drug kingpins. But he has so far offered only vague details of his security plans, focusing instead on social and economic programs.         \n\nWhile Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto portrays himself as the leader of a new generation of reformers, he is also a scion of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which ruled Mexico for more than 70 years through a combination of corruption and coercion until it lost power in 2000. During its time in power, the party was known more for keeping the United States at arm\u2019s length while attempting to strike deals with drug traffickers, rather than combating them head on.         \n\nMr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s election has brought the PRI back to power, and since so many of those serving in his cabinet have one foot in the past, foreign policy experts who specialize in Mexico say it is not clear where the new government is headed.         \n\n\u201cIt could go either way,\u201d said Eric L. Olson of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, speaking of future cooperation between Mexico and the United States. \u201cPart of me says, \u2018Let\u2019s not assume it\u2019s all going to go south.\u2019 And there are things that are happening that give me hope. But the longer it goes without some clarity, the more doubts creep in.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/world/americas/us-stepped-in-to-halt-mexican-generals-rise.html", "date": "2013-02-04", "description": "Gen.
