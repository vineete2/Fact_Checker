{"headline": "Who Made That Kale?", "body": "\nScientists disagree about when humans first tasted kale. But it is known that the ancient Greeks cultivated leafy greens, which they boiled and ate as a cure for drunkenness. And early Roman manuscripts include references to \u201cbrassica,\u201d a word that encompassed wild turnips, cabbages and kalelike plants. By the Middle Ages, kale had spread through Europe and Asia. The Italians developed plants with \u201cdinosaur\u201d scales, while the Scots created varietals with leaves like frilly petticoats. The Russians produced kale that could survive in the snow. But by the time Tim Peters, who was then farming in Oregon, began experimenting with the plant in the 1980s, kale had become \u201cboring.\u201d \u201cYou only saw the green kind in the supermarket,\u201d he says, \u201cif you could find it at all.\u201d         \n\nTo create his own varietals, Peters planted Siberian kale on his farm, and also along roadsides, so that bees could cross-pollinate the vegetables with neighborhood weeds. \u201cI love working with bees,\u201d Peters says. \u201cThey\u2019ll do stuff that you didn\u2019t dream of.\u201d One day he noticed that some of his blue-green Siberians had produced \u201cbabies\u201d that looked nothing like their parents \u2014 they were red, with vellum-thin leaves. \u201cI\u2019d never seen kale like that before. I sent samples to seed companies, and they told me that it belonged to the red Russian family.\u201d Peters, it turned out, had created several new types of red Russian kale, a varietal that had been around for centuries. He named one particularly delicate strain Winter Red. As kale caught on, so, too, did Winter Red: some companies grew \u201chuge productions of it and released it as \u2018Red Russian\u2019 or \u2018Russian,\u2019 \u201d he says.         \n\nWhen growers introduced America to a rainbow of kales, from pink to purple, they created a new appetite for it, according to Drew Ramsey, a psychiatrist at Columbia University and a kale evangelist. The farmers\u2019 markets that proliferated in the last decade, he says, also helped to make kale the darling of foodies and chefs. Lately, kale has spread to some unlikely places \u2014 the menu of the Cheesecake Factory and the pages of Us Weekly (\u201cStars Who Love Kale\u201d). Ramsey\u2019s own kale fever started two years ago. \u201cWhen I look at a food, I think, How does it affect the brain? The nutrients in kale help to make us feel optimistic and ward off depression.\u201d He decided the best way to improve America\u2019s mental health was to push for a National Kale Day. The holiday has yet to be recognized by Congress, but Ramsey and his friends celebrated their first kale day on Oct. 2 this year. \u201cWe had a big party. We served kale cocktails, and then we danced.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \nYes. I can tell a lot about a person just based on whether they even know what kale is. If someone comes to me and says, \u201cWhat\u2019s kale?\u201d I know that\u2019s a person who is not going to farmers\u2019 markets. If someone in Vermont does not know what kale is, I almost feel sorry for them.         \n\n \n\u00a0To make me stop printing T-shirts, Chick-fil-A would have to prove customer confusion or loss of profit. I\u2019ve sold the shirts for over 12 years. I\u2019ve had thousands of conversations about this one design. People have made the joke \u201cOh, I thought it said \u2018Eat More Whale,\u2019 \u201d or \u201cOh, I thought it said, \u2018Drink More Ale.\u2019 \u201d Not once did anyone mention Chick-fil-A while asking about my shirts. So, I\u2019ll keep making T-shirts until a civil court tells me not to.         \n\n \n\u00a0That\u2019s the million-dollar question. I think there is something about just the right three-word phrase, like Nike\u2019s \u201cJust Do It\u201d or \u201cLife is Good.\u201d         \n\n \nThat\u2019s right.
