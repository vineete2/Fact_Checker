{"headline": "Private Preschools See More Public Funds as Classes Grow", "body": "\nCHICAGO \u2014 The preschoolers who arrived at school early for free breakfast on a recent morning quietly ate granola bars and yogurt as middle school students recited part of the rosary over the public address system.         \n\nAlmost none of the 4- and 5-year-olds attending the  \n, a parochial school here in the poverty-stricken Englewood neighborhood, are Catholic. But virtually all of them pay little or no tuition, which is subsidized by public funds.         \n\nStarting this fall, under an expansion led by Mayor Rahm Emanuel, the number of Catholic schools in the city receiving taxpayer money for preschool will nearly double. Across the country, states and districts are increasingly funneling public funds to religious schools, private nursery schools and a variety of community-based nonprofit organizations that conduct preschool classes.         \n\nAccording to the  \n at Rutgers University, about one-third of students enrolled in state-financed preschool programs attend classes conducted outside the public schools. In some states, the proportion is much higher: in New Jersey, close to 60 percent of students in publicly financed preschool are enrolled in private, nonprofit or Head Start centers, and in Florida, about 84 percent of 4-year-olds in state-financed prekindergarten attend classes run by private, faith-based or family centers.         \n\nNow, as President Obama pushes a proposal to provide public preschool for all 4-year-olds from families with low or moderate incomes, his administration acknowledges that many children will attend classes outside the public schools.         \n\nAdvocates say that with standards for the educational credentials of the teachers, class sizes and the quality of curriculum, such arrangements can work.         \n\n\u201cHigh-quality pre-K can happen in church basements, community centers or within the Y.M.C.A., as long as the standards are there,\u201d said Lisa Guernsey, the director of early education at the New America Foundation, a nonprofit policy institute.         \n\nAt a time when more lawmakers and activist groups are pushing to direct public money to parents through vouchers or tax-credit scholarships, some say the preschool financing structure could set a precedent for the rest of formal public schooling.         \n\n\u201cK-12 is heading to where early childhood has always been,\u201d said Harriet Dichter, the executive director of the Delaware Office of Early Learning who helped set up Pennsylvania\u2019s public preschool program when she was an education official there. \u201cIt\u2019s always been in this market kind of thing.\u201d         \n\nLast fall, Mr. Emanuel invited traditional public schools, charter schools, religious schools, community-based groups and Head Start centers to bid \u2014 and in some cases rebid \u2014 for public financing for preschool.         \n\nIn all, more than half of the publicly financed classes in Chicago, serving about 44,600 children, will be run by organizations that are not part of the public school district. Just over one in 10 students will attend preschools operated by faith-based groups.         \n\n\u201cI wanted to use competitiveness to reward the best in the class,\u201d Mr. Emanuel said in an interview, \u201cand not just say because you\u2019re a Head Start or a public school, you win by default.\u201d         \n\nThe patchwork nature of preschool across the country has evolved, driven by private initiatives and a welter of federal, state and local child care financing streams, including Head Start.         \n\nFrequently overcrowded public schools do not always have the space to add preschool classrooms. And many preschool classes \u2014 particularly those that serve low-income working families \u2014 are embedded in broader day care centers that operate longer days than a typical public school.         \n\nExperts in early education say that states and school districts need to supervise private preschools regularly. Across the country, practices vary: only four states received top marks from the National Institute for Early Education Research for the quality standards they set for preschools.
