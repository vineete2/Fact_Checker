{"headline": "Riding Away From a Bar Crawl With Citi Bikes", "body": "\nIt started as a normal date night: Shawn, a bearded graduate student who favors lumberjack plaid, went to Williamsburg for dinner and drinks with his girlfriend. But instead of taking the L train from their Chelsea apartment, they decided to ride Citi Bikes there and back.         \n\nA couple of cocktails at the Wythe Hotel led to beers at Mable\u2019s Smokehouse and a nightcap at Post Office, a dive-like whiskey bar. After four or five drinks, they undocked a pair of blue bikes and rode home over the Williamsburg Bridge.         \n\nAs usual, Shawn sped ahead, and as they ascended over the East River, he turned around to see where his girlfriend was. That\u2019s when he lost his balance, kicked his foot into a bridge railing and broke his toe.         \n\n\u201cI really wasn\u2019t that drunk,\u201d said Shawn, 30, who uses the bike-share program about 20 times a week. (Shawn, like many of the people interviewed, asked that his full name not be used; drinking and cycling is not really something to toot your bike horn about.) \u201cI\u2019ve never blackout Citi Biked.\u201d         \n\n \n, the city\u2019s newest form of public transportation, is colliding with one of the city\u2019s favorite pastimes: bar hopping. While ridership peaks during the day (for commuting to work, running errands and sightseeing), some New Yorkers are beginning to see it as a convenient way to explore the city\u2019s night life, despite the obvious pitfalls of getting behind those handlebars after a drink or two.         \n\nFor bar crawlers on a budget, the bike-share system beats paying for a cab; rides under 45 minutes are complimentary to members who pay a $95 annual fee. It\u2019s also better than sweating on a subway platform and woozily waiting for a train after a night of partying. This is especially true now, when late summer breezes make cycling almost bucolic.         \n\n\u201cAt night, not to sound cheesy, but you have the wind at your back and you just feel carefree,\u201d said Jillian, a bubbly 29-year-old brunette lawyer in Chelsea who has been to known to joy ride on a Citi Bike after a few cocktails.         \n\nBut is it illegal? Technically, no. While cycling under the influence is not explicitly against the law in New York City, a drunk rider can be charged with disorderly conduct or reckless endangerment, just as a pedestrian can. The program\u2019s user agreement prohibits riding \u201cunder the influence of any alcohol, drugs, medication or other substance,\u201d but no one\u2019s handing out breath testers at docking stations.         \n\nLikewise, there is no way of knowing how many of the 245,000 riders have done so while inebriated. But while there has only been a handful of Citi Bike injuries reported, anecdotal evidence and post-pub interviews suggest it has started to become a hazard of night life.         \n\nFor many late-night revelers, the temptation to hop onto a Citi Bike is too great to pass up. Michelle Young, the founder of the Web site  \n, frequently cycles from the Lower East Side to her home near Columbus Circle after a night out. After the gay pride march in June, she picked up a Citi Bike on Washington Street and \u201cweaved through the drunk crowds\u201d to get uptown. A cab would have cost about $10, and she estimates that she has more than recouped the bike-share membership fee by forgoing taxis and MetroCards.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cheaper and healthier,\u201d Ms. Young said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s definitely more pleasant than heading underground in the heat.\u201d         \n\nFor others, there\u2019s the added benefit of physical exercise, which can even help a person rationalize another trip to the bar. \u201cI do feel a sense of accomplishment when I Citi Bike to a place and I\u2019ll be like, \u2018I\u2019ll have a Bud Heavy today instead of a Bud Light,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Champak, a 29-year-old real estate developer who lives in Alphabet City. \u201cIf I biked there, I earned my drink. Every time I save a cab ride, I\u2019ve earned another drink.\u201d         \n\nCycling also adds a touch of whimsy to the usual bar crawl. Earlier this month, Monica, a 26-year-old college adviser, used the bike-share program for a \u201cSunday Funday\u201d bar crawl with two friends. They bought day passes in Murray Hill and took advantage of half-off drink specials at Destination bar in the East Village before heading to Blind Tiger in the West Village and Meatball Shop in Chelsea.
