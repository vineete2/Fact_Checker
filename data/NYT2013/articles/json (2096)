{"headline": "Once at Kennedy\u2019s Side, Now at One Another\u2019s", "body": "\nALLEN, Tex. \u2014 In the early morning darkness of Saturday, Nov. 23, 1963, at approximately 04:30 hours, Tim Cheek, a 20-year-old Marine assigned to body bearer duty, was one of eight enlisted men to carry President John F. Kennedy\u2019s coffin, first into the East Room of the White House, and then back out the next afternoon; up the steps to the Capitol Rotunda and then down the next morning; into St. Matthew\u2019s Cathedral and, then, out to the horse-drawn caisson waiting in the street.         \n\nAnd finally, across the lawn at Arlington National Cemetery to the grave site.         \n\nThere, after the prayers, Mr. Cheek and the other body bearers lifted the American flag from the coffin and folded it into a triangle that passed from his fellow Marine and friend, Jerry Diamond, at the rear left, to Mr. Cheek, at the front right, and a few people later, to Jacqueline Kennedy.         \n\n\u201cI was in a trance,\u201d said Mr. Cheek, 70, a retired insurance executive. \u201cWe were kids totally focused on doing our duty as well as we could.\u201d During those four days, \n he said, his main thought was, \u201cDon\u2019t drop the casket.\u201d         \n\n\u201cEspecially down the steep Rotunda stairs,\u201d he said. \u201cOne falter, and that casket was gone.\u201d         \n\nOnly once could he recall feeling the significance \nof the moment. He was marching with the caisson. Thousands lined Pennsylvania Avenue, though what he remembers was the quiet.         \n\n\u201cAnd then a woman yelled out Kennedy\u2019s name,\u201d he said. \u201cA shiver went through me, and I thought, \u2018That\u2019s the president of the United States inside there.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nOn Friday, precisely 50 years after the president was assassinated, about half of the 60 men who served as Marine body bearers, stood death watch or marched with the color guard and drill team are gathering here, at a Courtyard Marriott in this Dallas suburb for their second, and probably final, reunion.         \n\nThey are growing old. Mr. Diamond had hoped to attend the first reunion, three years ago, but he was not well and died in Stow, Ohio, on April 30, 2011, at age 67. Others are long dead. Chuck Finney, another body bearer, was shot down over Cambodia and not until a decade later, said his brother-in-law Ed McCloskey, a fellow Marine, was a piece of his elbow recovered and buried in Arlington.         \n\nMost of the nine interviewed were from poor or blue-collar families, and being chosen for such elite duty straight from Parris Island was their first step on the way to the middle class. Through the years, they rarely talked about it, but they never forgot about it either. An obituary in The Tribune-Democrat of Johnstown, Pa., for Mr. Diamond, a construction foreman, read like a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 except for one sentence: \u201cHe was especially proud that he was a pallbearer for the late President John F. Kennedy.\u201d         \n\nIf, as they say, Americans of that generation remember exactly where they were when President Kennedy was shot, the former Marines remember exactly where the president\u2019s remains were  \n he was shot. John Cunningham, who works in real estate in Denver, and Mr. McCloskey, a retired marketing director in Scaly Mountain, N.C., were among the dozen Marines to escort the ambulance up the White House driveway to the North Portico.         \n\nIn the East Room, during a prayer service for the Kennedys, First Lt. Bill Lee of Allen, Tex., who was in command of the silent drill platoon, stood guard at the head of the coffin.         \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re at attention looking straight ahead like a mannequin,\u201d said Mr. Lee, a retired human resources director. \u201cYou leave no footprints. No one is watching you, but you\u2019re part of history.\u201d         \n\nSeveral at the reunion said they were too young to appreciate the historical significance. But, they said, in a few years, they understood that the country had changed for good as politics grew more divisive.         \n\n\u201cI was an accidental participant at a turning point in history,\u201d Mr. Cunningham said.         \n\nHe went to Vietnam believing he was fighting for a worthy cause, but by 1970 he was taking part in an antiwar sit-in and in 1972 voted for George McGovern.         \n\nThey were picked because they tested well and looked like quintessential Marines: at least six feet tall, with straight posture and narrow waists. Lamont Pittman says he was told that in his case, an additional consideration was that they needed a black man.
