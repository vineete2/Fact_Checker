{"headline": "In Seafood Pajeon, Squid Laced With Crispy Batter", "body": "\n \n         \n\nMost seafood pajeon, the crispy Korean scallion-based pancakes, are more rice-flour batter than seafood. Not the ones at  \n in the Flatiron district. The chef Hooni Kim\u2019s pancakes are thick with squid rings and batons of whole scallion, barely held together with the lightly seasoned batter. The textures are manifold: meaty from the squid, crunchy yielding to soft from the fried bits of batter, juicy from the scallion.         \n\nOne of the secrets to this pancake is waiting for the oil to heat up before mixing the batter. That way, the batter doesn\u2019t sit around and turn gluey. Mr. Kim\u2019s other secret is that he uses two pans to fry the pancakes, to maintain the same temperature as he cooks each one. He browns the pancake on one side in one pan, then flips it into the other.         \n\nI found using one pan to be perfectly fine if you don\u2019t have to fry enough pancakes to feed a busy restaurant. Just keep your eye on the pancake. If it seems slow to brown on the second side, raise the heat.         \n\nOnce you have the proportions of the seafood to batter down, you can vary the ocean matter. Try using fresh shrimp, scallops or bits of crab. Even thick chunks of fish should work. Then eat it while it\u2019s piping hot \u2014 as hot as you can without burning your fingers. The risk is worth it.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n1/4 cup soy sauce         \n\n6 teaspoons rice wine vinegar         \n\n1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon mirin         \n\n2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons Korean denjang (fermented soybean paste) or Japanese red miso paste         \n\n1 tablespoon grated garlic         \n\n1 teaspoon grated ginger         \n\n1 egg yolk         \n\nGrapeseed or vegetable oil, for frying         \n\n200 grams rice flour (about 1 1/3 cups)         \n\n150 grams all-purpose flour (about 1 cup)         \n\n4 grams baking powder (about 1/2 teaspoon)         \n\n1 pound squid, cleaned and cut into 1/2-inch rings         \n\n2 bunches whole scallions, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces         \n\n1. In a small bowl, prepare the dipping sauce. Whisk together 2 tablespoons of the soy sauce, 2 teaspoons of the rice wine vinegar and mirin. Set aside.         \n\n2. In another small bowl, combine the remaining 2 tablespoons soy sauce, the remaining 4 teaspoons rice wine vinegar, denjang or miso paste, garlic, ginger, egg yolk, 1 cup of water and mix well.         \n\n3. Heat a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat with 1/4-inch grapeseed or vegetable oil. The oil should be hot, but not smoking, about 325 degrees.         \n\n4. In a large bowl, mix the rice flour, all-purpose flour and baking powder. Add the squid and scallions and toss to combine. Pour in the denjang mixture and stir until just combined, taking care not to overmix.         \n\n5. Carefully spoon half of the batter into the hot pan and fry until the bottom is golden and crispy, about 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and fry for another 3 to 4 minutes until crispy and cooked through. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet lined with paper towels so oil can drain. Repeat with the second half of the batter. Cut pancakes in quarters and serve with the dipping sauce.
