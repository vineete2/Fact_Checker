{"headline": "Metro-North Train Sped at 82 M.P.H. Ahead of Curve in Fatal Crash", "body": "\nThe Metro-North Railroad train that hurtled off the rails on a sleepy holiday weekend morning was traveling 82 miles per hour as it approached one of the sharpest curves in the region\u2019s rail system, federal investigators said on Monday \u2014 nearly three times the speed permitted through the turn.         \n\nThe throttle was still engaged \u2014 giving the engine power \u2014 until six seconds before the locomotive, in the rear of the train, came to a stop around 7:20 a.m. Sunday after the train careered toward the Harlem River, killing four people and injuring more than 70, north of Spuyten Duyvil station in the Bronx, officials said.         \n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board is leading the investigation, and a board member, Earl Weener, said the train\u2019s sudden power shift came \u201cvery late in the game.\u201d The board cautioned that it remained unclear if the speed was the result of human error or faulty equipment.         \n\nBut the extraordinary speed shed new light on the deadliest New York City train derailment in more than two decades and heightened the focus on the veteran engineer at the center of the investigation. The maximum allowable speed through the curve is 30 m.p.h.; even the straightaway north of the crash site permits speeds no greater than 70 m.p.h.         \n\nAsked if the safety board was looking into the possibility that the engineer, William Rockefeller, fell asleep, was using his cellphone or was otherwise distracted, a spokesman for the board, Keith Holloway, said, \u201cPart of our investigation, as in all investigations, is to look at human performance factors.\u201d         \n\nMr. Rockefeller\u2019s cellphone was recovered as \u201cpart of our routine process,\u201d Mr. Weener said, and the results of drug and alcohol tests conducted after the crash were not yet known. Mr. Rockefeller was treated at a hospital and released.         \n\nThe authorities said that the train\u2019s brakes appeared to have been operating effectively shortly before the crash.         \n\n\u201cWe are not aware of any problems or anomalies with the brakes,\u201d Mr. Weener said.         \n\nSenator Charles E. Schumer noted, \u201cThe train did make nine stops before coming to this curve. So clearly the brakes were working a short time before.\u201d         \n\nHe added that he was told by the safety board that the tracks in the area also seemed to have been in proper condition.         \n\nThe revelations came as workers raised the train cars \u2014 all seven and the locomotive had been derailed \u2014 and thousands of commuters were forced to use alternative routes. The police and prosecutors began a parallel investigation to see if a crime had been committed.         \n\nThe safety board\u2019s interview with Mr. Rockefeller, a Metro-North employee who lives in Germantown, N.Y., was cut short Monday afternoon and is to continue this week, officials said.         \n\nAnthony Bottalico, the acting director of the Association of Commuter Rail Employees, said that the interview was postponed because of \u201cthe trauma of the whole thing and the lack of sleep\u201d for Mr. Rockefeller.         \n\nSeveral law enforcement officials said that detectives from the New York City and Metropolitan Transportation Authority police, with assistance from the office of the Bronx district attorney, Robert T. Johnson, were mounting an investigation parallel to the safety board\u2019s inquiry.         \n\nThat was being done to collect evidence if officials determine a crime occurred, three law enforcement officials said. The safety board is not a law enforcement agency; its role is limited to issuing findings and making recommendations.         \n\nProsecutors from Mr. Johnson\u2019s office were at the scene of the derailment on Sunday, and two officials said the prosecutors had issued subpoenas for the engineer\u2019s blood samples, for drug and alcohol testing, and for his cellphone.         \n\nMr. Bottalico predicted that \u201cwhen all is said and done here,\u201d the authorities would find there was \u201cno criminal intent.\u201d         \n\nA senior official with the transportation authority has said that Mr. Rockefeller initially told emergency workers that he \u201cdumped the brakes,\u201d an emergency maneuver, after he realized he was traveling too quickly.         \n\nMr. Weener said that six seconds before the rear locomotive came to a stop, \u201cthe throttle was reduced to idle.\u201d The brakes were fully applied one second later.
