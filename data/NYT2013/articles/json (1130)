{"headline": "Get the Party Started With Fried Grits Cubes and Bourbon Mayonnaise", "body": "\n \n         \n\nAs my friend Karen always says, \u201cYou know it\u2019s going to be a good party if the host is deep-frying something when you arrive.\u201d         \n\nIf you agree, consider serving these crisp-edged, golden grits cakes topped with Bourbon mayonnaise and country ham at your next holiday shindig.         \n\nThese golden cubes, from the chef Kyle Knall at  \nrestaurant, have a lot going for them. The first is that other than the frying itself, which should be done within 20 minutes of serving, you can do everything else ahead. The grits mixture, once spread in the pan and covered with plastic wrap, will keep for three days in the fridge, as will the mayonnaise. You can even tear the ham into slivers that morning as long as you keep them well wrapped in the refrigerator so they don\u2019t dry out.         \n\nYou do need to find some good quality grits to use here. Although Maysville is named after a town in Kentucky, where grits abound, Mr. Knall stays local and sources his from a small mill in upstate New York called Wild Hive Farm. The country ham, however, is purely Southern and worth seeking out. But if you can\u2019t find it and didn\u2019t have time to mail-order it ahead, you can substitute a good Serrano ham or prosciutto. Either way, it\u2019s party food at its best.         \n\nRecipe:  \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/20/dining/get-the-party-started-with-fried-grits-cubes-and-bourbon-mayonnaise.html", "date": "2013-12-19", "description": "These crisp-edged golden grits cakes from Kyle Knall, the chef at Maysville restaurant, are party food at its best."}
