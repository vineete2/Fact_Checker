{"headline": "Picking Baseball\u2019s Award Winners", "body": "\nMike Scioscia was in a rush before Thursday\u2019s game in Texas. Scioscia, the manager of the  \n, had fungoes to hit and a game to try to win, even though his team never contended in a forgettable season. Scioscia paused for 90 seconds to take questions from reporters, including one about Mike Trout\u2019s case for the American League Most Valuable Player award.         \n\nScioscia could have swung at the softball and driven it as far as he wanted. But Scioscia, pretty clearly, suggested that a player on an also-ran team should not win the award.         \n\n\u201cYou talk about the M.V.P. thing, I think there is some weight on where a team ends up, and I think that\u2019s probably going to factor into the equation,\u201d he said.         \n\nThere was no arguing that point. Since the playoff field expanded in 1995, 29 of the 36 M.V.P. winners have come from postseason teams. But does Scioscia think team success  \n be a factor?         \n\n\u201cYeah, I think it should,\u201d he said, and then hustled away. That settled that \u2014 even the Angels\u2019 manager would not support Trout\u2019s cause. The  \n\u2019 Miguel Cabrera is destined to be a repeat winner, and Trout seems likely to be runner-up again.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be like last year,\u201d Trout said matter-of-factly. \u201cHe\u2019s on a winning team. I think with M.V.P. awards, that\u2019s one factor that factors in.\u201d         \n\nEven so, Trout, 22, has been remarkable again this season. He leads the A.L. in walks, runs, times on base and Wins Above Replacement. He is the first A.L. player ever with 70 extra-base hits, 30 steals and 100 walks in a season.         \n\nJust two other players in the last 25 years have had 30 stolen bases to go with a .320 batting average, a .420 on-base percentage and a .550 slugging percentage. The others \u2014 Larry Walker in 1997 and Rickey Henderson in 1990 \u2014 won the M.V.P.         \n\nTrout has shown commendable plate discipline after a season-ending foot injury to Albert Pujols, who did not play after July 26. In the last 10 games through that date, Trout drew two walks. In the next 10 games, he drew 18. It was as if pitchers conceded that they could not figure out what to do with Trout, even with a year and a half to study him, and simply refused to let him beat them.         \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re making adjustments to me, and I\u2019m making adjustments to them,\u201d Trout said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to change it up every at-bat and try not to repeat. Some series they\u2019re trying to pound me in; sometimes, they look away. They\u2019re trying to make me think more up there. But I\u2019m just keeping my same approach, and it\u2019s been working.\u201d         \n\nTrout\u2019s approach, the way he uses a player\u2019s complete toolbox, makes him the most talented all-around player in the game. But Cabrera, again, is the right choice for M.V.P. There is just no force like him.         \n\nCabrera has been even better than he was last season, when he won the triple crown. Baltimore\u2019s Chris Davis, with 53 home runs through Friday, will lead the league. But Cabrera entered Saturday having hit as many homers this season, 44, as he did in 2012, while leading the A.L. in average and trailing only Davis in runs batted in.         \n\nCabrera also entered the weekend leading in on-base percentage and slugging percentage. He does not influence games in as many positive ways as Trout, but his contributions at the plate are too overwhelming to ignore. He gets on base most often and does the most damage. That is a hard combination to beat, and would be even if Cabrera was not headed to the playoffs.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n The  \n\u2019 Andrew McCutchen will win this award because he is the best player on a surprising playoff team, a combination that resonates with many voters. He also satisfies the statistically minded crowd by ranking at or near the top in Wins Above Replacement.         \n\nMcCutchen is a wonderful player \u2014 like Trout, he provides significant value on the bases and in the field, as well as at the plate. But Paul Goldschmidt of the Arizona Diamondbacks was significantly more productive as a hitter.         \n\nGoldschmidt leads the N.L. in O.P.S. (on-base plus slugging percentage) and carried the Diamondbacks to second place, anchoring a lineup with no other imposing hitters. Goldschmidt led the league in homers and runs batted in through Friday, and regularly delivers big hits when his team needs them most. His average with runners in scoring position, through Friday, was .338. McCutchen\u2019s was .282.
