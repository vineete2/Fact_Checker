{"headline": "In a Car-Culture Clash, It\u2019s the Los Angeles Police vs. Pedestrians", "body": "\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 In a city of seemingly endless highways \u2014 with its daily parade of car accidents, frustrating traffic jams and aggressive drivers \u2014 the Los Angeles Police Department these days is training its sights on a different road menace: jaywalkers.         \n\nIt is not quite \u201cDragnet,\u201d but the Police Department in recent weeks has issued dozens of tickets to workers, shoppers and tourists for illegally crossing the street in downtown Los Angeles. And the crackdown is raising questions about whether the authorities are taking sides with the long-dominant automobile here at the very time when a pedestrian culture is taking off, fueled by the burst of new offices, condominiums, hotels and restaurants rising in downtown Los Angeles.         \n\n\u201cWe have to encourage this, not discourage this,\u201d said Brigham Yen, who writes a  \n on downtown development, as he stood at a bustling corner in the city\u2019s financial district at lunchtime the other day, casting an eye around for a police officer in the shadows. \u201cWe should let pedestrians in L.A. flourish. We shouldn\u2019t penalize it.\u201d         \n\nThe police say they are simply trying to maintain order at a time when downtown Los Angeles, once a place of urban tumbleweeds and the homeless, is teeming with people competing for pavement with automobiles. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge influx of folks that come into the downtown area,\u201d said Sgt. Larry Delgado of the Central Traffic Division. \u201cIf you go out there, you are going to see enforcement.\u201d         \n\nStill, the enforcement has struck many of the pedestrians \u2014 the new kids on the block \u2014 as more than a little one-sided and strikingly strict. When Adam Bialik, a bartender, stepped off the curb on his way to work at the Ritz-Carlton a few blinks after the crossing signal began its red \u201cDon\u2019t Walk\u201d countdown, he was met by a waiting police officer on the other side of the street and issued a ticket for $197.         \n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even know that was against the law,\u201d he said. \u201cI was like, \u2018You are the L.A.P.D., and this is what you are doing right now?\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nThese pedestrians are confronting not only the police, but a historically entrenched car culture that has long defined the experience of living and working in Los Angeles. With its wide streets, and aggressive motorists zipping around corners, cutting in and out of lanes and sneaking past red lights, Los Angeles is hardly built for people who prefer to walk.         \n\nYet times may be changing. There are an increasing number of people using bicycles, taking advantage of an expanding network of bike lanes. Los Angeles is in the midst of a major expansion of its subway and bus system. Much of the urban planning in recent years, particularly downtown and in Hollywood, is intended to encourage people to give up their cars in favor of public transit, walking or biking.         \n\nFrom that perspective, the crackdown is a coming-of-age moment for this city, a ratification of how far it has come. It is a matter of simple mathematics: There are now enough people around to ticket.         \n\nWhen Charlie Beck, the Los Angeles police chief, appeared on KPCC, a public radio station, for his monthly call-in program last week, he was repeatedly asked about the focus on pedestrians. Chief Beck said the crackdown was a matter of public safety and traffic flow, noting the frustration of drivers trying to make turns and faced with crosswalks filled with people.         \n\n\u201cThis is the most crowded period of the year in downtown,\u201d Chief Beck said. \u201cA lot of that traffic can be impeded by pedestrians who are not following the rules in crosswalks.\u201d         \n\nBut a number of people argue that Los Angeles is taking the wrong side in this pavement tug of war, and failing to adjust to changing times.         \n\n\u201cL.A. needs jaywalking,\u201d said Nelson Algaze, a Los Angeles architect who was born in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, lives in Manhattan Beach and works downtown. \u201cIt\u2019s so stupid. What it does is it inhibits the vitality of Los Angeles. When you go to New York, when you go to Chicago, when it\u2019s safe to cross the street, you just cross the street. You just do it.\u201d         \n\nBlair Besten, the executive director of the  \n Improvement District, said she was concerned that it could scare off tourists from other parts of the country, not to mention tourists from other parts of this vast city.
