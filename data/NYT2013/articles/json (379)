{"headline": "Quinn\u2019s History of Mastering the Insiders\u2019 Game", "body": "\nThere was always a bit of scrappiness to the can-do activism of the New York City Anti-Violence Project, an advocacy group that promoted gay rights out of a neighborhood storefront in the West Village.         \n\nThe close-knit staff would take to the streets to protest antigay crime and the perceived indifference of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani\u2019s administration. Once, the group duped the police by applying for a permit to demonstrate in Queens and then rallying at the gates of Gracie Mansion instead.         \n\nThings changed after a new executive director, Christine C. Quinn, arrived.         \n\nBullhorns were set aside. Ms. Quinn moved the organization out of the Village and into a corporate-style suite in a Midtown high rise. She wooed wealthy donors. And she emphasized negotiation, rather than confrontation, with City Hall.         \n\n\u201cIt became more of a work-from-the-inside thing, rather than working with the grass roots,\u201d recalled Ray Dries, a veteran of New York\u2019s gay activist scene.         \n\nMs. Quinn joined the group in spring 1996, a few months before her 30th birthday. Now that Ms. Quinn, a Democrat, is a leading candidate to be the next mayor of New York, her campaign has been dogged by criticism that as speaker of the City Council, she abandoned her early idealism, watering down liberal initiatives for political expediency and the advancement of her career.         \n\nBut a review of Ms. Quinn\u2019s early career in the city suggests that she has preferred the insiders\u2019 game from the start. During her first decade after college, when she worked as an advocate on housing and gay rights issues and as an aide to the city\u2019s first openly gay councilman, she honed the work-the-system strategy that has brought her both criticism and praise in more recent years.         \n\nAt the Anti-Violence Project, Ms. Quinn doubled the organization\u2019s budget and expanded its national profile, earning plaudits from the board of directors. But the advocates in her midst viewed her actions as a betrayal. Staff members threatened a walkout; many later resigned.         \n\nIn an interview this month, Ms. Quinn readily acknowledged that she viewed consensus and compromise as the most effective route to bringing about change, be it as an advocate or an elected official. \u201cIt isn\u2019t about getting some good housekeeping seal of approval from whoever gives that out on the left wing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about making people\u2019s lives better and helping them when they\u2019re in a time of need.\u201d         \n\n\u201cBeing an activist is about getting things done,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s not about standing around shaking your fist in anger.\u201d         \n\nMs. Quinn, a native of Long Island, got her start in activism as an undergraduate at Trinity College in Hartford, where she joined the campus chapter of the  \n. She worked briefly after college as a political organizer in Massachusetts; she then moved to New York City, where, after a few months as a fund-raiser, she was hired as lead organizer of the Housing Justice Campaign, which advocated for tenants and affordable housing measures.         \n\nMs. Quinn quickly established herself as a tireless and creative advocate, working the phones until late into the night. \u201cShe was the best organizer we ever had,\u201d said Jay Small, a former colleague. \u201cShe was fearless, in a lot of ways.\u201d         \n\nSo unafraid was Ms. Quinn, that, even as a new hire in her early 20s, she showed the brazenness of a politician twice her age, directly approaching board members to criticize the parent group\u2019s executive director, Bonnie Brower, who had hired her just months earlier.         \n\nMs. Brower recalled being impressed with Ms. Quinn\u2019s energy. \u201cI can actually picture her in my office, during the interview, and she seemed ready to go,\u201d she said. But after the episode, she revised her view.         \n\n\u201cShe has used the Housing Justice Campaign to earn street cred as a progressive, but in reality, I don\u2019t think she had a passion for principle,\u201d Ms. Brower said.         \n\nMs. Quinn was not the only employee who raised concerns about the director, who later left the group. Asked recently about the episode, she said, \u201cI remember feeling there was more we could have been doing, and I wanted to make sure we were doing it.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/18/nyregion/for-quinn-a-long-history-of-playing-the-insiders-game.html", "date": "2013-06-17", "description": "A review of Christine C.
