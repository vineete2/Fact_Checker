{"headline": "New York\u2019s Junior Senator, Doggedly Refusing to Play the Part", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 If there were a chutzpah caucus in the United States Senate,  \n of New York would be its natural leader.         \n\nOn a fund-raising swing through Chicago this fall, she told donors to pressure their hometown senator \u2014 Richard J. Durbin, a Democrat who is one of the most powerful men in the Senate \u2014 because he had yet to sign on to her bill to address sexual assault in the military. Mr. Durbin fumed when he heard about the move, an unusual breach in the protocol-conscious Senate.         \n\nShe defies her party in smaller ways: After a bipartisan  \n was cobbled together with great effort by her colleague Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Ms. Gillibrand tried to block cuts to food stamps that other Democrats said were needed to retain Republican support and brought in high-profile foodies from New York, including the celebrity chef Tom Colicchio, to fight it.         \n\nHer other tactics include cornering colleagues on the Senate floor and refusing to stop talking, and popping out a news release picking apart a senator\u2019s competing legislation as it is being announced.         \n\nIf her colleagues grumble about her ambition in a body where freshman members are applauded for keeping their heads down, so be it. \u201cI\u2019m trying to fight for men and women who shouldn\u2019t be raped in the military,\u201d she said of her work on the sexual assault legislation. If her approach \u201cmakes a colleague uncomfortable,\u201d she said, \u201cthat\u2019s a price worth paying.\u201d         \n\nBut Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s savvy has quickly brought her national prominence in a chamber in which she has served less than five years and has elevated the issues she has championed, like the sexual assault bill and  \n. Her relentlessness is combined with a personal warmth and charm \u2014 she steps an inch toward anyone who approaches her, not away, locking eyes as they speak \u2014 and she deftly uses outside advocacy groups and the news media to push her agenda.         \n\n\u201cShe just approaches colleagues differently than other Republicans and Democrats from New York,\u201d said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa. What distinguishes her, he said, is \u201cher determination and knowledge and willingness to sit down one on one with senators and explain what she is up to.\u201d         \n\nAn outside player in her caucus, the New York Democrat is nonetheless admired for her ample fund-raising, especially by women; she has raised nearly $30 million since being  \n, a tally that has scared away potential challengers from both parties and turned her into a mentor for female candidates around the country.         \n\nMs. Gillibrand, who is 46, was the youngest senator when she was sworn in, and she seems a distinctly modern figure in a sometimes cobwebbed institution. She can swear like the litigator she once was, and runs one of the most informal offices in the Senate; her staff members are welcome in jeans and even in something resembling pajamas, and they call her Kirsten, rather than Senator, largely unheard-of on Capitol Hill.         \n\nShe appeared in an elegant dress in Vogue magazine, and is co-captain of the congressional softball team. Seemingly always working \u2014 she has a book out next September \u2014 Ms. Gillibrand nonetheless leaves the office promptly at 5 every night to pick up her children from school. If there is a vote at that hour, she has developed a system to signal her aye or nay from a doorway off the Senate floor \u2014 where children are not permitted \u2014 so she can hold onto her 5-year-old\u2019s hand. \u201cShe is ubiquitous,\u201d said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, \u201cand I mean that as a compliment. I don\u2019t know how she does it.\u201d         \n\nSome of Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s Democratic colleagues are less enamored, likening her zeal to that of the  \n Republicans who hew to a belief and won\u2019t let it go, ignoring some of the structural protocols of seniority.         \n\n\u201cShe is unwilling to knuckle under to demands for deference,\u201d said Eugene R. Fidell, who teaches military justice at Yale Law School. \u201cIt is very rare that you see a relatively junior member of the Senate staking out a position and sticking by it.\u201d         \n\nMs. Gillibrand\u2019s taste for a fight was presaged in her decision to run for the House in 2006, when she took on Representative John E. Sweeney in a Republican-rich district in upstate New York.         \n\nWhen she approached Howard Wolfson, a Democratic strategist, for help, he told her she could not win. \u201cShe told me she was going to run, was going to win, and I would either be the winning consultant or someone else would be,\u201d he said. \u201cI took the race.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/07/us/politics/new-yorks-junior-senator-doggedly-refusing-to-play-the-part.html", "date": "2013-12-06", "description": "Kirsten E.
