For those like you who came of age in the 1960s and \u201870s, let me start with a quick history lesson: The drag queens (and others) who fought back against a police raid at the  \n in 1969 are properly credited with the  \n. To this day the butch lesbians known as  \n put themselves out there, front and center, in pride parades from New York to San Francisco. These women and men have led the way in the struggle to earn civil rights for all of us and they deserve our gratitude, but instead they (along with others deemed too \u201cflamboyant\u201d) are often pilloried by those who say \u201cthey ruin it for the rest of us.\u201d         \n\nWhere does this attitude come from? There\u2019s certainly a dichotomy in our community, with some people valuing assimilation and others celebrating diversity. The so-called \u201cBrooks Brothers\u201d types have no doubt helped the movement by \u201cnormalizing\u201d us (think Will Truman of  \n), but excluding our less conforming sisters and brothers is no way to define ourselves. It\u2019s possible that those who disdain difference and who focus on making gays look \u201cgood\u201d (often meaning  \n) to the outside world are revealing their own insecurities. My take on it is that this young man\u2019s criticism of your son is a perfect example of how damaging  \n can be.         \n\nEither way, the comment made to your son was disrespectful, wrong and especially hurtful coming from another gay student.         \n\nI asked Eliza Byard, executive director of the  \n what she thought about this situation. \u201cWhen the pressure comes from a straight person to conform \u2014 \u2018don\u2019t be so flamboyant\u2019 or \u2018tone it down\u2019 \u2014 it\u2019s difficult and dangerous,\u201d she said. \u201cComing from another gay student, it\u2019s even more sad and troubling. This person should be on your side.\u201d         \n\nFrankly, I\u2019m saddened and troubled that there are \u201csides\u201d to this at all, but they certainly did emerge when I posted your question on my  \n. One boomer-aged gay man seemed to support the \u201cmainstreamers\u201d when he wrote: \u201cI like my men to be ... men, you know? That\u2019s why I\u2019m gay. I\u2019m not a \u2018fan\u2019 of flamboyant men. And while I don\u2019t hide any gay \u2018traits\u2019 I might express, I also hope I don\u2019t come off as flamboyant myself.\u201d         \n\nBut I think the food writer Eric Burkett, in his comments to me, really got to the core of the problem: \u201cWhen I was a teen, I was enormously uncomfortable with flamboyant \u2014 or as I would have put it then, \u2018nelly\u2019 \u2014 gay guys. I was out but still not entirely comfortable with myself. Peer pressure, societal and family expectations and the entirely unreal expectations we have of ourselves all conspire to make teenagers the most insecure people on the planet.\u201d         \n\nSo, what\u2019s a supportive mom (or dad) to do? I don\u2019t know how your son reacted in the moment, but in a perfect world he would have had a \u201ccome to Jesus\u201d talk right then and there \u2014 not punishing but enlightening. Even now it\u2019s not too late to craft a response; your son can go back to his classmate and restart the conversation privately, and not combatively. Or you might e-mail the G.S.A. adviser and get him or her involved. (A G.S.A. is the perfect place to have these honest conversations, and the group\u2019s adviser would probably want to schedule a session on the topic to help foster understanding and clear the air.)         \n\nYour son\u2019s critic also needs to be reminded that the real threat is not from outr\u00e9 gays but from rabid opponents of gay rights \u2014 who don\u2019t make any sartorial or behavioral distinctions. James Dobson, the founder of  \n, a conservative evangelical nonprofit, has said point blank: \u201cSame-sex relationships undermine the future generation\u2019s understanding of the fundamental principles of marriage, parenthood and gender.\u201d Make no mistake, Mr. Dobson wasn\u2019t talking about those who are effeminate or butch -- no gay person gets a free pass or a marriage license. That sobering thought might help get us all on the same side, united against those who would deny our rights, rather than dividing ourselves.         \n\nOh, and please tell your son how proud you are of him just the way he is.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/02/booming/a-flamboyant-taunt-by-a-fellow-gay-student-how-a-mother-can-help.html", "date": "2013-04-02", "description": "Standing up for a son who is disparaged by another gay teenager not only helps him but can lead to helpful discussion."}
