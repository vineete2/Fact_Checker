{"headline": "Besler Elbows His Way Onto U.S. Team", "body": "\nAt first glance, all appears to be going well for the United States national team.         \n\nJurgen Klinsmann\u2019s squad is currently in first place in its World Cup qualifying group and is now in the quarterfinals of the Gold Cup, facing El Salvador in Baltimore on Sunday. The team is in the midst of an eight-game winning streak and is playing its most attractive soccer in years.         \n\nIts recent success, however, is a stark contrast to only a few months ago.         \n\nAfter the United States lost its World Cup qualifier at Honduras to open the final round of qualifying and struggled to find any rhythm offensively, the team faced a wave of criticism. To address the issues, Klinsmann made several changes, but few, if any, have been more important than bolstering the backline with the Sporting Kansas City central defender Matt Besler.         \n\nAt the start of 2013, Besler had never played for the national team, but he impressed in his debut against Canada in January and has since been gradually solidifying his spot within the team. His breakout performance came in March when he played a full 90 minutes in a scoreless draw on the road at Azteca Stadium against archrival Mexico.         \n\nSince then,  \nhas been a regular starter for Klinsmann and is now likely to play a role at next year\u2019s World Cup. On Wednesday Klinsmann added Besler to the U.S team for the knockout stages of the  \n. The coach also recalled Omar Gonzalez (who will only join the team should it advance) and Eddie Johnson. He also added striker Alan Gordon while dropping Corey Ashe, Herculez Gomez, Jack McInerney and Oguchi Onyewu.         \n\nWith important games ahead in 2013 for both club and country, Besler is using his recent international experience to grow into a leadership role at Sporting Kansas City, which is helping him develop into a more confident player.         \n\n\u201cThe biggest thing has to be confidence,\u201d Besler said. \u201cThat\u2019s an important part of soccer. I need to be a leader and I need to be one of the best players on the field every time. I think at this level if you\u2019re not getting better, you\u2019re going to get left behind and that applies to every single player no matter how good you are.\u201d         \n\nBesler\u2019s path to the national team has been a unique road that is uncommon for many top American players. A quick examination of the backgrounds of many of the players on the national team shows that most come either from major cities with an established soccer infrastructure or from ethnic communities with a deep-rooted soccer culture.         \n\nThat was not the case for Besler, 26, who is from Overland Park, Kan., a suburb of Kansas City.         \n\nGrowing up, Besler did not frequently watch European soccer or idolize the world\u2019s best players. Instead his memories revolve around attending local indoor soccer games or playing pickup games in the parking lots of Arrowhead Stadium before and after Kansas City Wizards games in the early days of Major League Soccer.         \n\n\u201cIn regional tournaments against the states with better competition, we were looked down upon,\" Besler said. \u201cIt motivated me, too. You look at a kid from New York and say \u2018that kid has a chip on his shoulder coming out of the city.\u2019 I view it as I have a chip on my shoulder coming from Kansas. I\u2019d been overlooked for many years and the whole state has been overlooked talent-wise. I kind of carry a chip on my shoulder to try to prove people wrong. It carries over to this day. I even joke with Michael Bradley about when we got to play his Chicago club team it was such a big deal to us. We wanted to beat them no matter what.\u201d         \n\nBesler has felt at home in the Midwest, where he has played his entire career. After a four-year career at Notre Dame where he was both an all-American and an academic all-American with a premed degree, he had the opportunity to go to graduate school on a scholarship but elected to pursue his soccer career.         \n\nOne person who is not surprised by Besler\u2019s success is Notre Dame Coach Bobby Clark. Clark, who was on Scotland\u2019s 1978 World Cup team, believes Besler has the ability to succeed at the highest level.         \n\n\u201cI always say good players make it look very easy,\u201d Clark said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the things Matt does. Unless you really get to know him, you might miss him. His passing is good. He\u2019s always thinking and he\u2019s got a quiet confidence about him.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/19/sports/soccer/besler-elbows-his-way-in-to-us-team.html", "date": "2013-07-18", "description": "Defender Matt Besler has rejoined the U.S. national team for its Gold Cup quarterfinal match against El Salvador in Baltimore on Sunday."}
