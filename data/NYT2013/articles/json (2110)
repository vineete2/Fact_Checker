{"headline": "Indulging in Miso After the Holiday Feast", "body": "\nI don\u2019t fast after the  \n Day eat-a-thon and the long weekend of continued feasting and indulgence; perhaps I should.         \n\nBut for a week or so I definitely cook in a more light-handed way.         \n\nTo counteract the effects of traditionally heavy, rich fare, I happily lean toward vegetables and fish, eschewing most oils and fats, knowing that the holiday season is beginning. There will be plenty more opportunities to imbibe and gobble in the weeks to come.         \n\nStill, I want flavorful food. That\u2019s where miso comes in. Miso, the fermented paste made from soybeans or grains, is Japan\u2019s answer to eating light. It comes in many shades. Pale, sweet, fine-textured shiro (white) miso has higher rice content and a relatively short fermentation, while the ruddy red-brown soybean types called aka (red) miso have a deeper, almost nutty flavor. Both are delicious, and by all reports, nutritionally beneficial, containing antioxidant minerals, vitamins and protein.         \n\nAll well and good, and nice to know, but what attracts me is the taste, and miso\u2019s versatility in the kitchen.         \n\nStir a little miso into broth for a quick soup, or add a spoonful to vegetable salads. It makes a great dip for a platter of raw vegetables like radishes, carrots and cucumbers. Miso-coated warm vegetables like grilled eggplant are immensely appealing, too.         \n\nFish baked in miso is quintessentially Japanese, but I first learned about it years ago from the very American James Beard. I used to make his version of miso-marinated salmon often. Miso marries well with other oily fish like mackerel or black cod, but mild firm-fleshed fish like sea bass or halibut also make fine candidates. It\u2019s simply a matter of coating fish fillets or steaks with a mixture of miso, sake, mirin and a little ginger. An egg yolk may be added to help burnish and glaze the fish under the broiler.         \n\nServed with a pile of wilted greens dabbed with sesame oil, miso fish makes a light, easy post-Thanksgiving meal \u2014 far more satisfying than a juice cleanse, though nearly as virtuous.
