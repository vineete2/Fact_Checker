{"headline": "Wade\u2019s Performance Calls to Mind His Form in \u201906 Finals", "body": "\nSAN ANTONIO \u2014 Dwyane Wade had just spent 40 minutes slashing and scoring and dominating, recalibrating expectations for him and his Miami Heat teammates, and so all he seemed to want late Thursday was a quiet moment to himself. Away from the cameras and the boom mikes and the rap music pulsing at the other end of the locker room, Wade looked down and closed his eyes. He folded his hands and propped up his head with his thumbs.         \n\nBoth knees were wrapped in ice \u2014 the knees that had reduced him to a bystander at times in these playoffs, sapping his explosiveness and aggression and encouraging speculation that, at 31 years old, he had slipped into a state of irreversible decline. Such a notion seems foolish now, after he paired 32 points with a comprehensive performance \u2014 six rebounds, six steals, four assists \u2014 in Miami\u2019s 109-93 victory over the San Antonio Spurs, which evened the N.B.A. finals at two games apiece.         \n\n\u201cYeah, I needed a game like this, but my teammates needed a game like this from me,\u201d Wade said. \u201cNeeded me to be aggressive. Needed me to play the way that I\u2019m capable of.\u201d         \n\nThat was an interesting choice of words, and telling. The Heat never seem to know which version is going to play that night, and, perhaps, neither does Wade, who is averaging the fewest minutes, points and field-goal attempts of his nine postseasons.         \n\nIt used to be that Wade would play the way he did Thursday, and it would be accepted as fact that he would duplicate that effort the next game, and the one after that. Now such moments are met with bewilderment, part of a continuing mystery of his last three months.         \n\nHis brilliant performance Thursday evoked the 2006 N.B.A. finals as he posted his first 30-point game since March 4, less than 48 hours after muddling through a 36-point defeat, a lapsed member of the so-called Big 3. Even after Thursday, either outcome seems plausible for Game 5 Sunday night and the games beyond.         \n\nLeBron James was so taken with Wade\u2019s performance that he came uncharacteristically close to using off-color language in the postgame interview room to describe affectionately how well his teammate had played.         \n\nFearful that his children were watching the interview, James decided not to finish his thought. His point made, he opted to describe Wade\u2019s night as amazing by reciting, from memory, his statistical line and calling him Flash, his old nickname.         \n\nWhen Wade is playing at the height of his powers, he drives, he attacks, he does not think. He gets the ball, and if the shot is there, he takes it. To James\u2019s delight, that happened 25 times in Game 4 \u2014 by far Wade\u2019s highest shot total of the playoffs.         \n\n\u201cNo second-guessing, just playing,\u201d Wade said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about, \u2018I need to pass, I need to get off the ball.\u2019 It was just, \u2018I\u2019m open, I\u2019m shooting it.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nBy replacing Udonis Haslem with the sharpshooter Mike Miller, the Heat improved their spacing, creating room for James and Wade to drive. The Spurs, by cramming the middle, had stymied them in recent games, enticing Miami to take outside and midrange shots. Many of them did not go in, especially in Game 3. Wade welcomed those opportunities, but only when they presented themselves.         \n\nThe Spurs may not fear Wade, but they are wary of him now. They watched him score on three consecutive fourth-quarter possessions in three different ways: a left-handed hook shot after a spin in the lane, a dunk in transition and an 18-foot step-back jumper over Tim Duncan. The dunk, Wade said, \u201cwas a little vintage right there.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI think after a performance like last game, the competitor in you comes out,\u201d Shane Battier of the Heat said. \u201cYou see what guys are made of when the media and fans start burying you and start calling for your time of death.\u201d         \n\nThere is no immediate solution to Wade\u2019s knee problems. It is possible that he will need surgery, and if so, that could rejuvenate him, restore his energy, extend his career.         \n\nWade does not enjoy discussing his knee. It is fine, always, and nothing more. Recently, when asked whether there was a correlation between his injury and his diminished production in the second halves of games, he dismissed the question as pointless. To him, perhaps, but it was \u2014 is? \u2014 a genuine concern.         \n\nThrough the first three games of this series, Wade was shooting 22.2 percent (4 for 18) after halftime. On Thursday, he had 18 points and was 8 of 14 from the field. The improvement, perhaps, was a product of adjustments and concessions Wade had made. He had spoken with his coach, Erik Spoelstra, about taking shorter breaks to keep his knee loose. During those rests Thursday, he soothed his knees with hot packs to prevent them from stiffening while on the bench. They helped, Wade said, so it stands to reason that he will do it again in Game 5.         \n\nIt is far more difficult to project anything else.         \n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t feel like 2006,\u201d Wade said, \u201cbut it felt good.\u201d         \n\nGood enough to sustain this effort? He smiled.         \n\n\u201cI guess there\u2019s only one way to find out,\u201d Wade said. \u201cSee you Sunday.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/15/sports/basketball/wade-gives-the-heat-a-vintage-performance.html", "date": "2013-06-14", "description": "Dwyane Wade scored more than 30 points for the first time since March 4, and added six rebounds and six steals in Miami\u2019s Game 4 victory."}
