But the man whose music career has spanned more than 45 years seems to be open-minded about some very modern takes on his music and artistry. One of the latest, a rendition of Mr. Young\u2019s 1972 song \u201cOld Man\u201d by the rock band  \n, is not actually a cover. Rather, it is a reinterpretation \u2014 through the technique called sampling. Redlight King, whose new album, \u201cIrons in the Fire,\u201d came out today, received Mr. Young\u2019s permission to use pieces of the original song in their rap rendition. Mr. Young has also said that he enjoys Jimmy Fallon\u2019s impersonations, parodying unlikely mainstream hits for fun. In his recent memoir,  \nMr. Young says, \u201cJimmy sounds like a 20-year-old me,\u201d adding that thanks to Mr. Fallon\u2019s dead-on impressions ( \n and on  \n), he no longer has to do TV himself.         \nNEIL YOUNG - OLD MAN \nRedlight King - Old Man \nBruce Springsteen And Neil Young Sing \"Whip My Hair\" (Jimmy Fallon) \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/booming/old-man-twice-neil-youngs-way-and-redlight-kings.html", "date": "2013-09-10", "description": "The older songwriter gives a hip-hop-influenced band permission to sample his classic."}
