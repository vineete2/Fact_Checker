{"headline": "Political Fight on Farm Aid and Food Stamps Hits Home in the Delta", "body": "\nBELZONI, Miss. \u2014 Thomas Bond, a cotton grower whose onetime 8,500-acre partnership of farms received $4 million in federal subsidies in the last seven years, thinks that many residents in the surrounding Mississippi Delta need food stamps. But he says the program is too big and rife with fraud.         \n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people on food stamps who shouldn\u2019t be,\u201d Mr. Bond said in a recent interview at the Yazoo Country Club. \u201cThey could be working, but don\u2019t.\u201d         \n\nAttitudes like that anger Monica Stokes, who works as a clerk at a local check-cashing store and has been cut off from $167 a month in food stamps because her income rose slightly.         \n\n\u201cMaybe I should go out and plant me a couple acres so I can get some of that money the farmers get,\u201d she said as she took a smoke break on a recent morning outside the store, in Belzoni, the seat of Humphreys County. \u201cThe farmers make a lot more than I do, and they still get money from the government. How is that fair?\u201d         \n\nThis fertile alluvial plain, once home to the plantations that made it one of the richest cotton-growing regions in the country, is now at the epicenter of the acrimony over a new farm bill in Congress. The conflicting views of residents about cutting food stamps and overhauling the farm subsidy program mirror those in Washington, but here the talk is more about real lives than government policy.         \n\nSince 1995, farms in Humphreys County have received about $250 million in subsidies, which puts Humphreys close to the middle in a list of counties that get the payments. At the same time, nearly half of the county\u2019s 9,100 residents receive food stamps, one of the highest rates in the nation.         \n\nAs a result, Humphreys has one of the greatest disparities between the poor, who face food stamp cuts under proposals in the new farm bill, and farmers, who stand to gain more in subsidies.         \n\nThe bill, a 1,000-page measure that sets the nation\u2019s food and nutrition policy and is typically renewed every five years, includes both the food stamp program and the subsidies paid to farmers. Competing versions of the new bill in the Senate and the House remain mired in partisan gridlock. Farmers are operating under an extension of the existing farm bill, which is due to expire at the end of this month.         \n\nFarmers here would greatly benefit from a proposed expansion of the $10-billion-a-year crop insurance program in both the Senate and House versions of the new bill. But a proposal by Republicans in the House version would cut about $40 billion from food stamps, which would result in the removal of five million people nationwide from the program, according to the  \n a left-leaning research organization. The Senate is insisting on a much lower reduction in food stamps.         \n\nThe House version also includes new work requirements and drug tests for food stamp recipients.         \n\nIt is unclear how hard the proposed cuts would hit residents in Humphreys County, where unemployment hovers around 13 percent, but local recipients and state officials say they are concerned. Food stamps were already cut by up to $16 a month for many residents after a provision in the 2009 economic stimulus bill expired on Nov. 1.         \n\n\u201cAnything that reduces the program further will have an impact and could result in families\u2019 going without the benefits that get them over the hump every month, particularly in a county like Humphreys,\u201d said David Noble, the state operations director at the Mississippi Department of Human Services, which administers the food stamp program here.         \n\nFood stamp recipients in Humphreys County readily agree. Frank Baity, an unemployed worker who was shopping on a recent morning at West Side Grocery in Belzoni, said the few hundred dollars a month his family received in food stamps typically lasted a few weeks. Like Ms. Stokes, the clerk at the check-cashing store, he is resentful of the farmers. \u201cWhy are they getting all that money from the government?\u201d he said.         \n\nLenora Holmes Sutton, the recently elected mayor of Belzoni, takes a middle road in the debate over food stamps and farm subsidies. In an interview, she said that further cuts to food stamps would have a devastating effect on the area, but that support for agriculture, which accounts for nearly 30 percent of commerce in the county, was essential.         \n\n\u201cWe are a poor area, and we will take whatever we can get,\u201d Ms. Sutton said.
