{"headline": "The Architecture of Autism", "body": "\nSONOMA, Calif. \u2014 Here is a truth about children with autism: they grow up to become adults with autism. Advocates estimate that over the next decade some 500,000 such individuals will come of age in the United States.         \n\nNo one can say for sure what adulthood will hold for them. To start, where will everyone live and work? A 2008 Easter Seals study found that 79 percent of young adults with autism spectrum disorders continue to reside with their parents. A solid majority of them have never looked for a job.         \n\nAnd yet the life expectancy of people with autism is more or less average. Here is another truth, then, about children with autism: they can\u2019t stay at home forever.         \n\nThis realization \u2014 as obvious as it is worrying \u2014 has recently stirred the beginnings of a response from researchers, architects and, not least, parents. In 2009, a pair of academics, Kim Steele and Sherry Ahrentzen, collaborated on \u201cAdvancing Full Spectrum Housing,\u201d a comprehensive design guideline for housing adults with autism. (An expanded book on the topic is scheduled to come out next year.)         \n\nPerhaps the first development to closely follow their template is Sweetwater Spectrum, a residence for 16 adults whose abilities and disabilities span the full range of autism. The innovative $10.4 million project opened in January in the heart of California wine country, and its founding families and board hope to make Sweetwater a model for like-minded experiments across the country.         \n\n\u201cYou hear about different organizations planning to do these things,\u201d said Dr. Ahrentzen, a professor in the Shimberg Center for Housing Studies at the University of Florida, in Gainesville. But \u201cit takes time to get all these different funding sources in place.\u201d         \n\nMs. Steele said: \u201cDid it become fashionable? All of a sudden there are a lot more.\u201d         \n\nThe pair ran off a list of new and prospective housing projects on Cape Cod and in the Catskills, Phoenix and suburban Minnesota. One of the most promising efforts, Dr. Ahrentzen said, is Airmount Woods, in Ramsey, N.J., which will welcome tenants in November.         \n\nBut it would be hard for any of these campuses to look as \u201cvisually stunning as Sweetwater on the outside,\u201d Ms. Steele said, with its 3,250-square-foot, four-bedroom, five-bathroom houses near a picturesque downtown.         \n\nIt\u2019s easy to plan a pleasant day at Sweetwater. Start off the morning with 30 minutes on the elliptical trainer in the exercise room. For breakfast, how about collecting a few fresh eggs from the chicken coop to cook in the community kitchen? Sow a tray of tomato seeds in the expansive greenhouse, shoot a few baskets on the outdoor hoop. And if it\u2019s Friday, why not drop by activity night in the social hall?         \n\nThese amenities are central to the enterprise, said Sweetwater\u2019s chief executive and executive director, Deirdre Sheerin, 53. The public image of living with autism is one of lethargy and social isolation, she said. Picture someone \u201csitting on a Barcalounger with a video game, eating weird foods.\u201d By contrast, everything about Sweetwater exists to inspire a \u201clife with purpose.\u201d         \n\nTo start, residents have chosen to move here; they have chosen their housemates, too. Similarly, families contract for their own care, be it round-the-clock support or drop-in help. In one sense, Ms. Sheerin said, Sweetwater is a glorified landlord: each tenant signs a 12-month lease and pays rent ($650) and an association fee ($2,600) every month.         \n\nAt the same time, Sweetwater\u2019s mission statement lays out some ambitious principles. Residents will be able to age in place. The community should \u201caccommodate a broad financial spectrum,\u201d subsidizing residency for a quarter of its tenants. And attendants (who are not Sweetwater employees) should be offered incentives to encourage stable, long-term care relationships.         \n\nGeorge Uberti, a 28-year-old personal attendant, likes the idea of helping clients in a community that belongs to them. \u201cBut the real difference is the resources,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a pool here that\u2019s just outside. We have a library. We have a farm. Normally, a big part of supportive living is we have to manage behaviors within certain settings. We have to ride the bus.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/10/garden/the-architecture-of-autism.html", "date": "2013-10-09", "description": "Sweetwater Spectrum, a California residence for autistic adults, hopes to become a model for like-minded experiments across the country."}
