{"headline": "Silver Becomes Her, in a Show\u2019s Portraits", "body": "\nAmy Hempel\u2019s silver white hair is a fact of life. But more than that, it is a banner of identity. Ms. Hempel, the short story writer, recalled recently that a former beau had spied her as she was running to meet him for a movie date. As she caught up with him, he murmured appreciatively: \u201cI knew that was you. I saw that flag of hair.\u201d         \n\nMs. Hempel, 61, is one of several dozen graying women, their hair cropped or curly, tightly bound or cascading past their shoulders (like Ms. Hempel\u2019s), flaunting their waves, who are the subjects of a series of portraits by Vicki Topaz, a photographer in San Francisco. Five years ago when she herself was about to turn 60, Ms. Topaz set out to photograph and interview a group of her contemporaries. Their images, captured over a four-year period, form the substance of an exhibition titled \n on view this month at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging in Novato, Calif., in Marin County. Ms. Topaz\u2019s subjects gaze pensively into her lens, some positively reveling in their manes, raking their fingers through masses of curls, fanning out steel-colored strands, or tossing them every which way in a signal act of defiance.         \n\n\u201cThese are women who have fun,\u201d Ms. Topaz said. \u201cThey\u2019re confident and at ease with being who they are.\u201d Most were self-assured enough, in fact, to speak candidly about when and why they stopped masking their gray.         \n\nPracticality was certainly a factor. \u201cThe majority of women who had let go of dyeing found that they had one less burden,\u201d Ms. Topaz said. \u201cOnce they\u2019d lightened their load, they were free to get on with it, whatever it was they were doing with their lives.\u201d         \n\nGoing gray helped her to look her age, recalled Alice Shaw, an artist in her late 40s. She was just 37 when she spotted the first hints of gray. \u201cNow I keep it that way,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes me look authoritative.\u201d         \n\nMs. Topaz\u2019s subjects, accomplished and highly articulate, flaunted pewter, silver or steel-colored locks that sometimes doubled as a metaphor, a potent symbol of where they had been and who they had become.         \n\n\u201cThis is me and I don\u2019t plan to change,\u201d said Susan Kim, 54, a boutique owner, shown in the photographs, shaking out a full head of silver-streaked hair. She had no plans to color, nor would she opt for plastic surgery or a radical diet, Ms. Kim insisted. \u201cThere are a lot of other things I want to do with my life.\u201d         \n\nFor Yasmina Rossi, 58, a model and photographer, long, gray hair functions as an enveloping cloak. \u201cIt protects me everywhere I go in the world,\u201d Ms. Rossi said. \u201cI\u2019ve been in deep Amazonia, I\u2019ve been in Egypt, and in places completely isolated, and people were respectful of me because of my gray hair.\u201d         \n\nSome women faced hurdles. Friends and family members sometimes raised an eyebrow. While in her late 40s, Gloria Frym, a college professor in her 60s, asked her husband how he would feel if she stopped dyeing her hair. As she recalled, he informed her tersely, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready for that yet.\u201d         \n\nMs. Hempel, whose hair was threaded with flint by the time she was 19, and entirely white by the time she had reached her mid-40s, said not all her friends, the women in particular, had been receptive.         \n\nSome had been downright disapproving. \u201cA very good friend of mine told me,\u201d she said with a laugh, \u201c\u00a0\u2018It just looks like you\u2019re wearing a powdered wig.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nReactions in the workplace were tougher still. \u201cThese women were competing with colleagues who were 10 to 20 years younger,\u201d Ms. Topaz said. \u201cYounger seemed more desirable, and they felt really challenged by that.\u201d         \n\nYet, as some of her subjects insisted, showing off a bright mantle of gunmetal hair in no way diminished their sexual allure. In the street men would shout after them, \u201cHey, silver fox,\u201d some of the women told her.         \n\n\u201cBy no means did they feel they were approaching the end of something,\u201d Ms. Topaz said. \u201cMany of them felt they were only now in their prime.\u201d         \n\nMs. Topaz still dyes her hair, for which she has taken plenty of ribbing. But her husband, perhaps wisely, offers no judgment. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to go there,\u201d she said. \u201cHe told me, \u2018Just do what makes you happy.\u2019\u00a0\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/booming/silver-becomes-her-in-a-shows-portraits.html", "date": "2013-02-06", "description": "Graying women, their hair cropped or cascading past their shoulders, are the subjects of portraits in an exhibition by Vicki Topaz, a San Francisco photographer."}
