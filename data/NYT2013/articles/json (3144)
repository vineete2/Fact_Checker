{"headline": "Giants Are in Dire Spot, but You Wouldn\u2019t Know It by Talking to Them", "body": "\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. \u2014 History suggests that the Giants, 0-3 and off to their worst start since 1996, should be all but bereft of hope. Since 1990, when the current playoff format began, only 3 of the 115 teams to drop their first three games have reached the playoffs.         \n\nBut the Giants are ignoring that daunting background as they prepare for Sunday\u2019s game in Kansas City, Mo., against the resurgent Chiefs, who are 3-0 in their first season under Coach Andy Reid.  \n  \n declined to characterize his team\u2019s visit to Arrowhead Stadium as a must-win situation.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long season,\u201d he said Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019ve played three games, and we have a lot of games to go. Certainly, we want to win. That\u2019s our entire objective. Are we standing on the edge of a cliff? I don\u2019t look at it that way. I see a lot of football to be played.\u201d         \n\n \n, a ninth-year defensive end and one of the team\u2019s captains, emulated the calm demeanor of his coach after a practice that was particularly spirited and scrappy.         \n\n\u201cWe still can do anything and everything we came into the season wanting to do,\u201d Tuck said, perhaps recalling the 2007 season, when the Giants started 0-2 but won the Super Bowl.         \n\nBoth comments were startling given the Giants\u2019 predicament, the deteriorating health of the roster and the enormous challenge that lies ahead. The team was dysfunctional in every aspect in absorbing the third-worst shutout defeat (38-0 to Carolina) in franchise history and the worst loss in Coughlin\u2019s 10 years as coach. The timing seemed especially poor because the players had vowed to rally around Coughlin after the unexpected death of his younger brother, John, last week.         \n\nMuch of the attention is on an offensive line that continues to fail the team. The Giants, traditionally known for a punishing ground game, are averaging a league-worst 44.3 rushing yards per game. With defenses forcing the Giants to pass more than they would like, the line is struggling to keep  \n upright.         \n\nManning, who lacks the mobility of many quarterbacks, has been sacked 11 times. The Panthers sacked him 7 times and hit him 15 times. He was sacked 20 times last season.         \n\nLeft guard Kevin Boothe said the line was unfairly taking the brunt of the criticism.         \n\n\u201cWhen we lose, we lose as a team,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, we could have played better. If you want to put it on us, that\u2019s fine. We\u2019re tough. We know we have to execute better for us to be successful as a team.\u201d         \n\nThe line could not afford one setback, let alone the two it received when Chris Snee, a four-time Pro Bowl right guard, and David Baas, the center, were unable to practice Wednesday. Snee, who had off-season surgery on his right hip, is having trouble with his left hip. Baas is dealing with a neck injury. On a positive note, the versatile tackle David Diehl returned to practice for the first time since having thumb surgery more than a month ago.         \n\nIt was unclear whether any of those linemen would play Sunday.         \n\nDefensively, the Giants rank last in points allowed per game (38.3). There was negative news on that side of the ball, too. Terrell Thomas, a cornerback who has endured three major operations on his right knee, was limited in practice and will most likely continue to be limited.         \n\nThomas made a heartening comeback after a two-year absence. He said the rigors of the first three games forced him to back off in practice and rely more on film study.         \n\n\u201cIf I can\u2019t go, I can\u2019t go,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I can, I can. Obviously, there are times when I have to push through it, but I have to be smart.\u201d         \n\nThomas said he was that Sunday\u2019s debacle would not be repeated against the  \n, who have beaten two of the Giants\u2019 N.F.C. East rivals in their last two games: the Dallas Cowboys (17-16) and the Philadelphia Eagles (26-16).         \n\n\u201cMan, we\u2019re going to fight,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cWe got socked in the mouth. That\u2019s not what the Giants are all about. We\u2019ve got players on this team who won two Super Bowls. They know all about being tough and resilient.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll definitely be a different team come Sunday.\u201d         \n\nEXTRA POINTS         \n\nFullback HENRY HYNOSKI was placed on injured reserve with a fractured shoulder. JOHN CONNER, drafted by the Jets in the fifth round in 2010 and quickly nicknamed the Terminator by Coach REX RYAN for his crushing blocks, replaced Hynoski on the roster. Conner was waived by the Jets on Oct. 18. He appeared in three games for the Cincinnati Bengals at the end of last season but was released at the end of training camp this summer. ... Cornerback COREY WEBSTER, sidelined last weekend by a hip flexor, missed practice but was said to be progressing toward his return.
