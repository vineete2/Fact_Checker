{"headline": "Daring Enough to Bare It All for a New York Swim", "body": "\nLifeguards prepared to leave the easternmost tower at Jacob Riis Park beach, blowing shrill warnings to swimmers that they would no longer be watching them that Saturday evening.         \n\nFor most, it signaled the end of a steaming summer day. But for some on land, more than a couple of them flushed from alcohol, it was the declaration they had been waiting for \u2014 to rush in, clothing optional.         \n\nSoon swimsuits hung like ascots around the necks of men and women in the waves. Cheering greeted a man streaking to the surf. Another, more tentative, took off his black underwear in the water, shrieking when his roommate ripped them from his hand and rushed ashore.         \n\n\u201cGive them back!\u201d he called out.         \n\nSkinny-dipping, a hot-weather pastime that calls to mind rustic swimming holes and summer camp double dares, has always been strongly correlated with extreme heat and an available body of water. But it is not often associated with New York\u2019s miles of densely populated shoreline.         \n\nHere, an extra level of daring \u2014 or, possibly, intoxication \u2014 is needed to make the dive. Naked swimmers act quickly under cover of darkness or in permissive pockets of the city: at the gay-friendly patch of Riis beach in the Rockaways or at a marina on City Island where Ivy League sailing teams sometimes bare all. They are even found away from the shorelines, in Bushwick hostel hot tubs or Midtown office building water towers.         \n\n\u201cIt can be a little bit claustrophobic,\u201d said Ida Benedetto, 28, of her water-tower dips with co-workers above their media company office. \u201cI did this about twice a week for a summer.\u201d         \n\nThe city affords a variety of locations where nude bathing is permitted or even required. There are religious bathers in many mikvahs, spagoers in Flushing, and men of means who doff clothes in the rarefied confines of Park Avenue sport clubs.         \n\nBut skinny-dipping is something different, its acolytes say. A term coined in the late 1940s, it connotes both quickness \u2014 a dip \u2014 and transgression, a departure from the old painted scenes of bathing in rivers. (The skinny part, linguists have argued, most likely refers to skin, not thinness.)         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about spontaneity and freedom in the moment,\u201d said Lauren Christianson, 23, who along with two partners is working on a guide to skinny-dipping around the city for their Web site,  \n. \u201cYou can\u2019t go in the East River or the Gowanus Canal. You have to find these secret spots.\u201d         \n\nOne spot eyed for the list, a hot tub at the New York Loft Hostel in Bushwick, may need to be reconsidered. The hot tub was taken out last year, a receptionist there said, after becoming an occasional clothing-optional hangout. The removal was \u201cvery possibly for that reason,\u201d she said.         \n\nA minor offense most often classified as either \u201cexposure of a person\u201d (a violation) or public lewdness (a misdemeanor), it is not the sort of crime that makes the blotter in New York, as it might elsewhere. Faced with a boisterous bunch of naked swimmers, many officers just shake their heads. \u201cMove along\u201d is more likely to be heard than \u201cYou\u2019re under arrest.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThey were like: \u2018Get out of the water. Oh, and put on your bathing suits,\u201d said Ashira Siegel, 35, remembering when a late-night adventure on Coney Island a few summers ago was interrupted by the police. No tickets were issued. \u201cThey were just amused, just kind of like, \u2018Yeah, yeah, O.K.\u2019 Very New York cop,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ve seen it all anyways.\u201d (She said she did not join her friends in stripping down.)         \n\nNear the glowing Wonder Wheel on a recent Saturday night, an officer leaning against a banister said he could count on one finger the number of skinny-dippers he had seen given tickets. \u201cThere was a guy today, but that was for public lewdness; a disturbed individual wandered onto the beach,\u201d he said, declining to be identified because of the subject matter and a lack of prior approval from Police Headquarters.         \n\n\u201cTry Brighton Beach,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s where the Russian guys are. But not now. After 5 p.m. or 6, when the lifeguards go home and the families leave, they\u2019ll do it.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/18/nyregion/daring-enough-to-bare-it-all-for-a-new-york-swim.html", "date": "2013-07-17", "description": "Technically speaking, skinny-dipping is illegal in the city, but that has not stopped swimmers from taking the risk."}
