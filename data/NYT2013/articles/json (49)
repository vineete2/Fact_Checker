{"headline": "Who Made That Hershey Bar?", "body": "\nIn the late 1880s, Milton Snavely Hershey, an American entrepreneur, sought to invent a new kind of caramel. Years before, as an employee at a candy shop in Denver, he learned to cook a tender caramel infused with milk \u2014 a vast improvement over its gluelike competitors. Hershey added more and more milk to his confection, until he\u2019d transformed his candy into a buttery dollop. Consumers went wild for it.         \n\nBy the end of the 19th century, caramels were so popular that they ignited a candy boom, with companies competing to get into the caramel business. When the caramel bubble eventually burst, Hershey was already scouting for the next big thing, says Michael D\u2019Antonio, author of \u201cHershey,\u201d a biography. The candymaker saw that the Europeans were \u201ccrazy for chocolate,\u201d D\u2019Antonio says, especially the milky confection that the Swiss had invented, which was so different from the gritty, mouth-puckering lumps then sold in American stores. Hershey, D\u2019Antonio says, \u201cknew the future was chocolate.\u201d         \n\nIn the 1890s, Hershey traveled to Switzerland, bent on ferreting out the secret that turned bitter cocoa powder into silky chocolate. Back home, he holed up in his lab to develop a product that could survive a ride across the country\u2019s growing railroad system. In 1900, he released his 5-cent bar. An early slogan \u2014 \u201cMore sustaining than meat\u201d \u2014 promoted it as a daily necessity for health. When you unwrapped the bar, you found a postcard that mythologized Lancaster, Pa., \u201cthe chocolate town\u201d where workers cavorted in a swimming park and cows roamed an emerald pasture.         \n\nThe town \u201cwas \u2018Truman Show\u2019-like because everyone participated in the conspiracy of utopia and perfection,\u201d D\u2019Antonio says. But behind the scenes, Hershey \u201cwas a dictator,\u201d suppressing strikes when workers demanded better wages. Perhaps his megalomania explains why he chose chocolate: it could be branded with his name. \u201cThe product lent itself to shaping and stamping,\u201d D\u2019Antonio says. Hershey, who ruthlessly ruled his own little republic, \u201calso wanted to mold human beings.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n Almost everyone thinks they do. But they change their minds. When you\u2019re actually holding a small version of yourself, you discover that you don\u2019t really want to bite into your own head. I\u2019d say one in five people actually eat it.         \n\n \n? When I was a grad student at the M.I.T. Media Lab, we were sitting around joking about what we could do with chocolate. I said, \u201cWhat if we made a mini Mount Rushmore, and you could eat your own head?\u201d         \n\n \n Yeah, chocolate doesn\u2019t have a natural form. It\u2019s not like a banana that has a defined shape. That means it lends itself into being formed into people\u2019s concepts.
