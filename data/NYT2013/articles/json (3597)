{"headline": "Amid Rising Discord Over Indian Images, F.S.U. Has Harmony", "body": "\nBefore every kickoff at Doak Campbell Stadium in Tallahassee, Fla., a Florida State student in facial war paint and an American Indian costume steers a spotted Appaloosa to midfield. As the horse rises on its hind legs, the rider, who is not an Indian, thrusts a flaming spear into the turf to the crazed accompaniment of the crowd\u2019s droning chant and an arm gesture called the tomahawk chop.         \n\nSaturday will be different, though, but not because a nationwide debate is swirling around the  \n\u2019 nickname or because some universities have re-examined their depiction of Native American culture.         \n\nRemaining unimpeachable, a 35-year ritual at Seminoles football games will merely be tweaked so the fiery weapon can be handed off and flung by the former coach Bobby Bowden.         \n\nThere will probably not be a peep of protest.         \n\nThe Seminole Tribe of Florida has granted written permission for the university to borrow symbols of its heritage. While other tribes have pressed institutions to amend certain traditions or abandon nicknames and logos, Florida State enjoys the imprimatur of its sports teams\u2019 namesake.         \n\n\u201cWe Seminoles embrace that mascot,\u201d Chief James Billie, the tribe\u2019s chairman, said. \u201cThey honor us.\u201d         \n\nFlorida State students voted on the nickname in 1947, when the all-women college became coeducational and started a football program. (Other nominees included Golden Falcons, Indians and Crackers.)         \n\nThe pregame theater featuring the characters Renegade (horse) and Osceola (human) was introduced in 1978, recalling a phase of history both meaningful and painful to Indians. Within a few years, the routine had ignited enough objections, primarily from civil rights and Indian activist groups, that the university pondered discarding it.         \n\n\u201cThere was pressure to change the nickname,\u201d said Dale Lick, F.S.U.\u2019s president in the early 1990s. \u201cIt was substantial.\u201d         \n\nThe tribe\u2019s endorsement during meetings with Lick was all that Florida State needed to retain the images, even though the more distant Seminole Nation of Oklahoma was not as enthusiastic.         \n\n\u201cHad Chief Billie and his leadership gone in another direction,\u201d Lick said, \u201cwe might have changed it.\u201d         \n\nIn return, the university has provided scholarships and cut-rate tuition for tribe members. Dr. Patricia Wickman, who attended the meetings as the tribe\u2019s director of anthropology and genealogy, urged Billie to seek 1 percent of revenue generated by the nickname, like money from souvenir sales.         \n\n\u201cHe looked at me like I was crazy,\u201d said Wickman, now a consultant to the tribe.         \n\nBillie explained, \u201cWe enjoy the games, so we\u2019re not begging for anything.\u201d         \n\nBillie occasionally attends games but prefers to watch on TV with his family. To Billie, who was restored by tribal vote to the chairman position in 2011 after being impeached eight years earlier, the Florida State community serves as an extended family to the tribe, which has a population of more than 3,000.         \n\nEvidence of the tribe\u2019s support extends to the splashes of garnet and gold, Florida State\u2019s colors, on the tribe\u2019s gymnasium and elsewhere at its reservation in South Florida.         \n\n\u201cAs long as they\u2019re winning, we\u2019re together,\u201d Billie likes to say, mostly as a joke.         \n\nThe Seminoles\u2019 football team is winning. Led by the redshirt freshman quarterback Jameis Winston, Florida State is No. 2 in this season\u2019s first Bowl Championship Series rankings and is 6-0 for the first time since 1999, the last season the team won a national championship.         \n\nThe tribe feels some ownership of the ceremony at Florida State home games. Osceola\u2019s garb and makeup were altered with the tribe\u2019s input. Although the university\u2019s pregame custom has met with criticism that it can conjure a stereotype of Indians in battle, the Seminole hierarchy approves of it.         \n\nRegarding opposition from American Indians outside Florida, Billie summons the notion of tribal self-determination, with each Indian people setting its own course.         \n\n\u201cWe tell them to go back to their own territory,\u201d he said. \u201cLeave us alone. This is my place, my home.\u201d         \n\nF.S.U. has been able to dig in its heels with backing from bodies of influence that go beyond the tribe.         \n\nIn 1999, the State Senate unanimously passed a bill that would have compelled the university to use the nickname. The House took no action, and the bill expired.
