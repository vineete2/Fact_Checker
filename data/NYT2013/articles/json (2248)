{"headline": "U.S. Catholics in Poll See a Church Out of Touch", "body": "\nRoman Catholics in the United States say that their church and bishops are out of touch, and that the next pope should lead the church in a more modern direction on issues like birth control and ordaining women and married men as priests, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.         \n\nSeven out of 10 say  \n and the  \n have done a poor job of handling sexual abuse, a significant rise from three years ago. A majority said that the issue had led them to question the Vatican\u2019s authority. The sexual abuse of children by priests is the largest problem facing the church, Catholics in the poll said.         \n\nThree-fourths of those polled said they thought it was a good idea for Benedict to resign. Most wanted the next pope to be \u201csomeone younger, with new ideas.\u201d A majority said they wanted the next pope to make the church\u2019s teachings more liberal.         \n\nWith cardinals now in Rome preparing to elect Benedict\u2019s successor, the poll indicated that the church\u2019s hierarchy had lost the confidence and allegiance of many American Catholics, an intensification of a long-term trend. They like their priests and nuns, but many feel that the bishops and cardinals do not understand their lives.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they are in the trenches with people,\u201d said Therese Spender, 51, a homemaker in Fort Wayne, Ind., who said she attended Mass once a week and agreed to answer further questions after the poll. \u201cThey go to a lot of meetings, but they are not out in the street.\u201d         \n\nEven Catholics who frequently attend Mass said they were not following the bishops\u2019 lead on issues that the church had recently invested much energy, money and credibility in fighting \u2014 artificial birth control and  \n.         \n\nEric O\u2019Leary, 38, a funeral director in Des Moines who attends Mass weekly, said: \u201cI would like them not to be so quick to condemn people because of their sexual preference or because of abortion, or to refuse priests the right to get married or women to be priests. I don\u2019t think the church should get involved in whether or not people use birth control.\u201d         \n\nThe nationwide telephone poll was conducted on landlines and cellphones from Feb. 23 to 27, when many Catholics were still absorbing news of the first resignation of a pope in 600 years. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus four percentage points for the 580 Catholics, who were oversampled for purposes of analysis in the survey of 1,585 adults.         \n\nBenedict, a soft-spoken scholar and a church traditionalist, had apparently made little impression on American Catholics in his eight years as pope. Half of those in the poll said they either had no opinion of him or had not heard enough about him. Nevertheless, 4 in 10 had a favorable opinion, and only one in 10 unfavorable.         \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s written three or four books, and his writings are incredible,\u201d said Leonard Lefebvre, 70, a retired economist in Tequesta, Fla. \u201cHe\u2019s continued on course, and he\u2019s held the religion to where it\u2019s supposed to be at.\u201d         \n\nThe poll suggested that the papacy no longer occupies the exalted position it once did. Asked whether the pope is infallible when he teaches on matters of morality and faith, 40 percent said yes, 46 percent said no, and 14 percent said they did not know. Nearly 8 in 10 Catholics polled said they would be more likely to follow their conscience on \u201cdifficult moral questions\u201d than to follow the pope\u2019s teachings.         \n\nWhen asked which \u201cone thing\u201d they would \u201cmost like to see the next pope accomplish,\u201d the most common responses that respondents volunteered were, in order: bring people back to church, modernize the church, unify the church, and do something about sexual abuse.         \n\nA spate of new information about prelates hiding the misdeeds of pedophile priests appeared to have taken a toll. A higher percentage of Catholics said the pope and the Vatican had done a poor job of handling reports of past sexual abuse recently (69 percent)  \n (55 percent), when the abuse scandal flared in many European countries. This is despite the church\u2019s many reforms in the last 10 years and reports of abuse by priests in the United States declining drastically.         \n\nMajorities said they wanted to see the next pope maintain the church\u2019s opposition to abortion and the death penalty, even though they themselves were not opposed to them. Three-quarters of Catholics supported abortion under at least some circumstances, and three-fifths favored the death penalty.         \n\n\u201cI can understand how the Catholic Church stands against it,\u201d said Geri Toni, 57, of abortion. \u201cWe are not supposed to kill. That is one of our Ten Commandments.\u201d         \n\n\u201cBut as a woman,\u201d said Ms. Toni, who lives in Fort Myers, Fla., and attends Mass weekly, \u201cI have to make sense of it, and I believe choice comes down to the individual.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/06/us/poll-shows-disconnect-between-us-catholics-and-church.html", "date": "2013-03-05", "description": "In a New York Times/CBS News poll, Catholics said that while their parish priests were in touch with their needs, the church and most American bishops were not."}
