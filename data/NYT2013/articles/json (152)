{"headline": "For Bloomberg and Bike-Sharing Program, the Big Moment Arrives", "body": "\nHe festooned New York City with hundreds of miles of bike lanes and dispatched chairs and picnic tables to Broadway, where cars once roamed.         \n\nHe helped finance plans to send the No. 7 train to the Far West Side, and carried the banner of congestion pricing, even if in vain.         \n\nBut for all of Mayor  \n\u2019s efforts to reimagine transportation in New York, critics and supporters seem to agree on the one that is most likely to define his 12 years at the city\u2019s controls.         \n\nAnd it  \n.         \n\nWith the introduction of a European-style bike-share system, billed by city officials as the first new wide-scale public transportation option in more than half a century, Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s longstanding bet on cycling has reached its climactic moment.         \n\nThe lofty ridership predictions presented by Mr. Bloomberg and his transportation commissioner, Janette Sadik-Khan, will no longer be theoretical. Opponents\u2019 admonitions of overstuffed streets and perilous pedaling will prove either prescient or exaggerated.         \n\n\u201cIt is the free market, if you think about it,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg said on Friday during his weekly radio show. \u201cIf people want to use them, they\u2019ll use them. If people don\u2019t, they don\u2019t.\u201d         \n\nThe program, which is to begin with 6,000 bikes stationed across parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn, will face immediate scrutiny from residents, riders and elected officials whose love or hate for the endeavor seemed to intensify over the past year of delays.         \n\nThe holdup, wrought first by faulty software and then by  \n stored at the Brooklyn Navy Yard during Hurricane Sandy, has given the rollout a sharper political edge. The system, which was supposed to begin last summer, will now be introduced through the peak months of an election year. And the crop of candidates \u2014 many of whom have been lukewarm toward Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s cycling policies in the past \u2014 will be watching closely.         \n\n\u201cIf this is a fiasco \u2014 and to me, a fiasco is mostly that the bikes just don\u2019t get used \u2014 then, yeah, it\u2019s going to tarnish the legacy,\u201d said Charles Komanoff, a transportation economist and longtime cycling advocate in the city. \u201cMore important, it\u2019s going to make it easier for the next mayor to backtrack.\u201d         \n\nBut if the program is an instant success, he added, \u201cit\u2019ll mean that almost anybody imaginable who is mayor is going to have to stick with whatever this mayor has already done.\u201d         \n\nFor all the administration\u2019s legwork \u2014 which included hundreds of meetings with community groups, elected officials, property owners and other stakeholders, and an online feature that received more than 10,000 suggestions for bike station locations \u2014 precise demand for bike share is near impossible to gauge.         \n\nThough bike commuting has grown on Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s watch, the most recent city figures showed that commuter cycling remained flat in 2012 during the typical riding season of April through October. In the same period, cycling had increased by 26 percent in 2009, 13 percent in 2010 and 8 percent in 2011, according to counts conducted at commuter points like the Brooklyn Bridge, the Manhattan Bridge and the Queensboro Bridge.         \n\nSome officials remain skeptical about the depth of citywide interest in cycling.         \n\n\u201cThe projections for bike share, I can\u2019t say I buy,\u201d said Councilman James Vacca, the chairman of the Council\u2019s Transportation Committee. \u201cBut we have to accept them as a given at this point because we have nothing else to go by.\u201d         \n\nMs. Sadik-Khan dismissed the most recent in-season cycling figure as statistical noise amid years of consistent growth numbers. She also pointed to an increase in off-season cycling in recent months: From December through February, the Transportation Department said, commuter cycling increased by 23 percent over the previous year. And the bike share program has already sold more than 14,000 annual memberships, Ms. Sadik-Khan said.         \n\nWhatever the appetite for bike share, Ms. Sadik-Khan has long argued that cycling infrastructure must be built in advance of demand as a way to encourage riding. In this way, the bike share program could be seen as an inevitable outgrowth, a plan that required years of investments before becoming feasible.         \n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t just drop this bike share system in overnight,\u201d she said. \u201cWe spent five years installing more than 350 miles of bike lanes.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/27/nyregion/on-eve-of-bike-sharing-debut-watching-for-a-fiasco-or-a-success.html", "date": "2013-05-26", "description": "With New York\u2019s system set to begin on Monday, the city will be watching to see if Mayor Michael R.
