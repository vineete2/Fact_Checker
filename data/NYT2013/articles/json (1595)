{"headline": "New Bells and Whistles at the Old Firehouse", "body": "\nFiremen\u2019s Hall, at 155 Mercer Street, is an odd, squat thing stripped of detail, a puzzling eyesore among the tony galleries and spiffed-up shops of SoHo. Now a new owner, Thor Equities, is working not to restore the 1855 building, but to recreate it.         \n\nIn the early 19th century, fire protection was the province of assorted, often competing, volunteer fire companies that sometimes even prevented one another from combating blazes.         \n\nCooperation came in little steps, one of them the city\u2019s construction of Firemen\u2019s Hall, used for two fire companies and as the volunteers\u2019 headquarters. The New York Times described the style of the brownstone facade as \u201cItalian, or in other words, a composition of Greek and Roman, applied by the Italians to modern building.\u201d         \n\nAccording to The Times account, written when the cornerstone was laid, the building was to be surmounted with three pedestals, the center one with a full-size statue of a fireman, \u201cthe same one who has stood sentry for so many years in front of the old Hall,\u201d which had been on the same site.         \n\nAt the end of the ceremony, the department was presented with the skiff that in 1842 had floated from the Croton Aqueduct to the new reservoir in Central Park, which greatly improved not only the city\u2019s water purity but its firefighting capacity.         \n\nInto the cornerstone were deposited a bible, the Book of Common Prayer and a dime from 1800, and carved on the brownstone piers on either side of the main doorway were hooks, ladders, axes and other tools of the trade. A fire helmet was carved on the keystone over the main entrance.         \n\nThe second and third floors were home to a library, a reading room and meeting rooms. These were used for events like a meeting in 1858, after the burning and collapse of the Crystal Palace on Sixth Avenue and 42nd Street. Harry Howard, the chief engineer of the department, proposed that firefighters solicit contributions from New Yorkers to replace fire apparatus destroyed in the disaster. But others insisted this was the city\u2019s responsibility and said that a fund-raising campaign would reduce sales of tickets to the various firemen\u2019s balls later in the year. Chief Howard\u2019s motion passed anyway.         \n\nAnother event that took place here was an 1871 meeting of the fledgling National Rifle Association; Gatling and Remington offered expensive weapons as prizes.         \n\nIn 1865 the volunteer system was replaced by the professionally staffed Metropolitan Fire Department, which became the  \n Fire Department. Twenty years later a new headquarters rose on East 67th Street, and old Firemen\u2019s Hall became just another firehouse.         \n\nExcept that it had Jenny, the ring-tailed monkey. For 12 years Jenny served as mascot of Hook and Ladder No. 20, which was quartered at 155 Mercer. One time she woke the sleeping company to a fire in its own building by throwing billiard balls down a flight of stairs.         \n\nAt a fire in 1907 her keeper, a fireman named Frank Murphy, wrapped her in a blanket to keep her dry. But she threw off the blanket to investigate a bunch of hats that had been thrown from the burning building, was soaked by a burst hose, caught a cold and died. Fireman Murphy was inconsolable, but The Marion (Ohio) Daily Mirror said that her body would be stuffed and displayed in the firehouse.         \n\nDamon Campagna, the executive director of the  \n, says that although it doesn\u2019t have Jenny, it does have a stuffed dog, the mascot of Engine 203, who was hit by a car in 1939. He says the last fire companies moved out of 155 Mercer in 1974, and a photograph from a few years later shows that the facade has been brutally shaved off.         \n\nThe building went to various arts organizations, and the Joyce Theater moved out last year, selling to Thor.         \n\nSo what did the original facade look like?\u00a0 Early images of Firemen\u2019s Hall do show a fireman at the top, with a trumpet in his left hand. But those are drawings; a photo from the late 1860s at the Museum of the City of New York shows no statue. The  \n has a statue that has often been said to be from Firemen\u2019s Hall, but the trumpet is in the statue\u2019s right hand, not left. The fire museum and the historical society agree that it\u2019s from Hose Company No. 55, on Christopher Street, not from Firemen\u2019s Hall. So it is not clear that there was ever a statue on the building.         \n\nThe new owner, Thor Equities, has an unusual opportunity. For all intents and purposes there is nothing left of the original building. Thor could propose a contextual cast-iron type structure of five or six stories, or a shiny modern structure of the same height. But the developer needs a special permit to allow retail on the ground floor, and a restoration of the original facade makes such a permit easier to secure.         \n\nSo, working with  \n, Thor proposes to recreate the old brownstone facade for a retail conversion, but with a few exceptions: the ground-floor cast-iron front installed at some point in the 19th century would be retained; the brownstone would actually be precast concrete; and the element crowning the building in 1855 would be omitted.         \n\nAnd there will be no Jenny.
