{"headline": "Mandela\u2019s Death Leaves South Africa Without Its Moral Center", "body": "\nJOHANNESBURG \u2014 Nelson Mandela, South Africa\u2019s first black president and an enduring icon of the struggle against racial oppression, died on Thursday, the government announced, leaving the nation without its moral center at a time of growing dissatisfaction with the country\u2019s leaders.         \n\n\u201cOur nation has lost its greatest son,\u201d President Jacob Zuma said in a televised address late Thursday night, adding that Mr. Mandela had died at 8:50 p.m. local time. \u201cHis tireless struggle for freedom earned him the respect of the world. His humility, his compassion and his humanity earned him their love.\u201d         \n\nMr. Zuma called Mr. Mandela\u2019s death \u201cthe moment of our deepest sorrow,\u201d and said that South Africa\u2019s thoughts were now with the former president\u2019s family. \u201cThey have sacrificed much and endured much so that our people could be free,\u201d he said.         \n\nMr. Mandela spent 27 years in prison after being convicted of treason by the white minority government, only to forge a peaceful end to white rule by negotiating with his captors after his release in 1990. He led the African National Congress, long a banned liberation movement, to a resounding electoral victory in 1994, the first fully democratic election in the country\u2019s history.         \n\nMr. Mandela, who was 95, served just one term as South Africa\u2019s president and had not been seen in public since 2010, when the nation hosted the soccer World Cup. But his decades in prison and his insistence on forgiveness over vengeance made him a potent symbol of the struggle to end this country\u2019s brutally codified system of racial domination, and of the power of peaceful resolution in even the most intractable conflicts.         \n\nYears after he retreated from public life, his name still resonated as an emblem of his effort to transcend decades of racial division and create what South Africans called a Rainbow Nation.         \n\n\u201cHis commitment to transfer power and reconcile with those who jailed him set an example that all humanity should aspire to,\u201d a grim President Obama said Thursday evening, describing Mr. Mandela as an \u201cinfluential, courageous and profoundly good\u201d man who inspired millions \u2014 including himself \u2014 to a spirit of reconciliation.         \n\nMr. Mandela and Mr. Obama both served as the first black leaders of their nations, and both men won the Nobel Peace Prize. But the American president has shied away from comparisons, often noting that his own sacrifices would never compare to the ones that Mr. Mandela endured.         \n\nMr. Obama said that the world would \u201cnot likely see the likes of Nelson Mandela again,\u201d and he noted that the former South African president had once said that he was \u201cnot a saint, unless you think of a saint as a sinner who keeps on trying.\u201d         \n\nMr. Zuma did not announce the specific cause of Mr. Mandela\u2019s death, but he had battling pneumonia and other lung ailments for the past six months, and had been in and out of the hospital. Though his death was announced close to midnight, when most in this nation of early risers are asleep, a small crowd quickly gathered outside the house where he once lived in Soweto, on Vilekazi Street.         \n\n\u201cNelson Mandela, there is no one like you,\u201d they sang, stamping their feet in unison to a praise song usually sung in joy. But in the midnight darkness, sadness tinged the melody.         \n\n\u201cHe was our father, our mother, our everything,\u201d said Numfundo Matli, 28, a housekeeper who joined the impromptu celebration of Mr. Mandela\u2019s life. \u201cWhat will we do without him?\u201d         \n\nHis death comes during a period of deep unease and painful self-examination for South Africa.         \n\nIn the past year and a half, the country has faced perhaps its most serious unrest since the end of apartheid, provoked by a wave of wildcat  \n, a  \n, a messy  \n and the deepening fissures between South Africa\u2019s rulers and its impoverished masses.         \n\nScandals over corruption involving senior members of the party have fed a broader perception that Mr. Mandela\u2019s near saintly legacy from the years of struggle has been eroded by a more recent scramble for self-enrichment among a newer elite.         \n\nAfter spending decades in penurious exile, many political figures returned to find themselves at the center of a grab for power and money. Mr. Zuma himself was charged with corruption before rising to the presidency in 2009, though the charges were dropped on largely technical grounds. He has  \n in the past year over $27 million spent in renovations to his house in rural Zululand.
