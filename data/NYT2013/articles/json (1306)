{"headline": "Low Pay at Weight Watchers Stirs Protest as Stars Rake It In", "body": "\nTammy Williams became a  \n leader in Texas five years ago after losing 97 pounds in the program. The supplies that she handles fill a bedroom in her home, and she holds four meetings a week advising more than a hundred customers about the diet regimen.         \n\nThe problem, Ms. Williams said, is that she works so many hours and is paid so little. \u201cThey know my love for the program, but I can\u2019t say we\u2019re treated right,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are professionals, we have to dress nice, but we are paid less than kids who work at McDonald\u2019s.\u201d         \n\nAs the highly competitive weight-loss industry continues to suffer from the sluggish economy \u2014 Weight Watchers reported a 15.6 percent decline in earnings last year \u2014 hundreds of its rank-and-file workers are waging an open rebellion that management is scrambling to address.         \n\nThis frustration reflects a growing discontent among low-wage workers, as seen in the recent protests at dozens of Walmarts, at high-end retailers in Chicago and at fast-food restaurants in New York. Low-wage workers have become more assertive out of dismay that while corporate profits have rebounded to record levels since the recession, wages have floundered.         \n\nMany also feel trapped as the gap between haves and have-nots has widened. Some employees at Weight Watchers expressed irritation at being paid the minimum wage while the company lavishes millions of dollars on celebrities like Jessica Simpson and Jennifer Hudson to advertise its weight-loss program.         \n\nExecutives at Weight Watchers say they are paying attention to their employees\u2019 concerns, and have hinted they will increase compensation.         \n\nThe company\u2019s chief executive, David Kirchhoff, wrote to employees earlier this month, saying, \u201cOne of our top priorities is to improve your working life at Weight Watchers, and in particular, the way we reward you for the incredible work you do.\u201d         \n\nEmployees \u2014 many of them leaders like Ms. Williams who run meetings \u2014 have inundated an internal company Web site with complaints about poor wages and being pressured to work many hours unpaid.         \n\nSome leaders say that the $18 base rate for running meetings has not increased in more than a decade, and many complain that they receive no mileage reimbursement for the first 40 miles driven each day. Some also assert that a major reason Weight Watchers keeps its pay so paltry is that the overwhelming majority of its employees are women.         \n\n\u201cWe are not working for a charity or a nonprofit corp,\u201d one Weight Watchers leader posted on the Web site. \u201cThis is a multimillion-dollar company with enough cash to advertise relentlessly on TV, and pay celebrities tons of money to lose weight.\u201d         \n\nThe restlessness over low pay extends across the weight-loss industry to Weight Watchers\u2019 rivals, including Jenny Craig and Nutrisystem. A pending lawsuit asserts that Jenny Craig\u2019s employees in New York State typically work through their lunch hour, but are not paid for that time \u2014 a claim the company denies. That comes after Weight Watchers reached a $6.2 million settlement two years ago to end a class-action lawsuit in California in which employees complained about minimum wage violations, off-the-clock work and receiving paychecks that did not explain how wages were calculated.         \n\n\u201dPeople feel they did everything right. They\u2019re working hard, they have higher levels of education than ever before, and they find the job market is offering them a wage that they can\u2019t live on,\u201d said Janice R. Fine, a professor of employment relations at Rutgers University.         \n\nFor Weight Watchers, one of the world\u2019s oldest and largest dieting companies, keeping its leaders happy is crucial to the company\u2019s future, because it relies on them to recruit and retain members through the nearly 50,000 face-to-face meetings the company runs each week worldwide.         \n\nThe leaders, often highly educated professionals who were hired after losing dozens of pounds in the program, sometimes sound like religious disciples, so eager are they to help others lose weight.
