{"headline": "A Complex Role for Medicare in the Standoff in Washington", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In some ways, the partisan standoff over looming budget cuts resembles earlier links in the chain of fiscal battles that began two years ago.         \n\nBut the politics of one core dispute between Democrats and Republicans \u2014 what to do about  \n \u2014 are changing. And some of those changes complicate  \n\u2019s agenda, even as he continues to flex his postelection muscle.         \n\nOne shift is the shrinking magnitude of the Medicare spending problem \u2014 a consequence, at least for now, of a recent slowdown in the rise of health care costs. That diminishes the willingness of Congressional Democrats, and perhaps the administration, too, to accept the sort of Medicare curbs that Mr. Obama has indicated that he favors.         \n\nAnother is a moderation in the public stance of Republican leaders. In recent weeks, they have advocated smaller changes to Medicare than the \u201cpremium support\u201d or voucher plan that Mitt Romney advocated and that Mr. Obama denounced in last year\u2019s presidential campaign.         \n\nAs a result, Mr. Obama\u2019s ability to deliver a bipartisan compromise on entitlement spending may be waning even as Republicans edge closer to one.         \n\nThe reduction in Medicare spending levels is the more drastic change.         \n\nIn August 2010, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that Medicare would cost $6.5 trillion from 2012 to 2020. A few months later, a deficit reduction panel appointed by Mr. Obama called those spending levels unsustainable.         \n\nBut the budget office\u2019s latest projections have pegged Medicare spending over the same period at $6.1 trillion. That $400 billion decline exceeds the $303 billion in savings over that period recommended in 2010 by the panel, which was led by former Senator  \n, a Republican, and  \n, who served as a chief of staff under President Bill Clinton.         \n\nThe causes of the decline, which could include the impact of a weak economy as well as adjustments by doctors and hospitals to policy changes in the 2010  \n, remain unclear. As does the decline\u2019s duration.         \n\nEven so, Harold M. Ickes, a longtime Democratic strategist and a veteran of Mr. Clinton\u2019s White House, said that \u201cit\u2019s going to be a hard case to make among Democrats that entitlements should be cut\u201d as long as that trend persisted.         \n\nYet no one argues that the deceleration in health costs has resolved the looming fiscal squeeze caused by the aging of the baby boom generation. Among the more optimistic liberal economists, Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research argues that the trend, if it continues, will eventually resolve 75 percent of the long-term budget challenge posed by Medicare.         \n\nMr. Obama, in calling for a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d budget deal with Republicans, has repeatedly invoked the need to curb entitlement spending. And he has said he would consider changes beyond the roughly $300 billion in Medicare spending reductions proposed in last year\u2019s budget.         \n\nBut lately the administration has backed away from the idea of raising Medicare\u2019s eligibility age, which Mr. Obama entertained in 2011 negotiations with Speaker  \n. Democratic policy experts say his willingness to bargain beyond existing public proposals may be ebbing.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not clear to me how he goes much further,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, a former economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. \u201cWe have some time to examine the progress we\u2019ve made and whether we can continue it. There\u2019s a little more oxygen in the room.\u201d         \n\nSuch reluctance worries Mr. Simpson and Mr. Bowles, who last week issued a new call for $600 billion in savings from Medicare,  \n and other health care programs. \u201cAny time you have an excuse not to make a cut in Washington, you take it,\u201d Mr. Bowles said.         \n\nThat could, in turn, sour prospects for an accord on Medicare just as Republicans shift toward a less confrontational stance.         \n\nLike Mr. Romney, House Republicans have pressed for shifting Medicare from an open-ended commitment to one that offers a fixed amount for each beneficiary. The president and his party have harshly criticized that approach for shifting financial risk from the government to retirees; Mr. Bowles, too, calls it \u201ca step too far.\u201d         \n\nRepublicans have shown concern about the political risks by postponing their plan to carry out that idea to spare current beneficiaries and those who are within 10 years of enrolling in Medicare. But lately they have displayed even more caution.         \n\nMr. Boehner did not demand premium support in negotiations with Mr. Obama over the  \n late last year. And in a recent speech intended to improve the Republican Party\u2019s image, the House majority leader, Representative  \n of Virginia, highlighted a less controversial way to \u201cmodernize Medicare,\u201d by combining its separate hospital and doctor services benefits with \u201creasonable and predictable levels of out-of-pocket expenses.\u201d         \n\nIn internal budget negotiations, House Republicans are now weighing the need to broaden their political appeal as well as to find more immediate budget cuts to meet Mr. Boehner\u2019s pledge to eliminate the deficit within 10 years. Unless they rapidly accelerate implementation of \u201cpremium support,\u201d the idea will not help on either count.         \n\n\u201cWe are rethinking,\u201d said Representative Tom Cole, an Oklahoma Republican who is on the Budget Committee.         \n\nAlthough the Budget Committee\u2019s chairman, Representative Paul D. Ryan, who was Mr. Romney\u2019s running mate, strongly backs premium support, \u201cit isn\u2019t realistic while Obama\u2019s president,\u201d said Yuval Levin, a former domestic policy adviser to President George W. Bush. \u201cIt makes sense for them to try to see what incremental steps can be taken.\u201d         \n\nThe Simpson-Bowles commission estimated that a shift of the sort that Mr. Cantor discussed could save $110 billion through 2020. Paul Starr, a Princeton professor and co-founder of the liberal magazine The American Prospect, has called the Simpson-Bowles version \u201cpretty good\u201d ideas and said Democrats \u201cshould not reject them out of hand\u201d even though they would affect beneficiaries.         \n\nRepublicans could press for other sources of Medicare savings that would be difficult for Democrats to resist. Both the deficit reduction panel and Mr. Starr have said the government could save $60 billion or more over 10 years by reducing the amount Medicare pays hospitals to educate medical residents.         \n\nThe Obama administration has proposed saving only a small portion of that amount, largely in deference to the influence of teaching hospitals and their Congressional backers in Democratic-leaning states like California, Massachusetts and New York. If Republicans heighten scrutiny of those payments, Democrats may find their resistance harder to defend than their opposition to benefit cuts.
