{"headline": "Redskins\u2019 Owner Stubbornly Clings to Wrong Side of History", "body": "\nOn Jan. 14, 1963, Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama delivered an  \n in which he declared his unwavering allegiance to \u201csegregation now, segregation tomorrow and segregation forever.\u201d         \n\nThose words became an anthem of intolerance and a rallying cry for those who opposed civil rights, equal rights and human rights. Those words defined Wallace\u2019s legacy.         \n\nFifty years later, Daniel Snyder, the owner of the N.F.L.\u2019s Washington franchise, is making an equally strident stand against civility that will define his legacy as an owner and as a citizen.         \n\nSnyder is facing a firestorm of pressure to change the team\u2019s nickname, which has been attacked as out of date, out of touch, offensive and racist.         \n\nHe has responded to critics by tossing out polls that show support for the nickname. He has also trotted out American Indians who say that they are not offended, ignoring voices who say they are. In the face of mounting criticism, Snyder remains defiant. In a  \n with USA Today, Snyder insisted: \u201cWe\u2019ll never change the name. It\u2019s that simple. NEVER \u2014 you can use caps.\u201d         \n\nSnyder is as misguided on this issue as he was in 1999, when he bought the team and thought that the way to win was to load his roster with stars. He was wrong then and he is wrong now. The difference was that then he offended only Washington fans; now he is offending a significant part of the nation. Criticism is coming from the White House as well.         \n\nIn a  \n with The Associated Press, President Obama said that \u201cif I were the owner of the team and I knew that there was a name of my team \u2014 even if it had a storied history \u2014 that was offending a sizable group of people, I\u2019d think about changing it.\u201d         \n\nHe added that he wasn\u2019t convinced an \u201cattachment to a particular name should override the real, legitimate concerns that people have.\u201d         \n\nObama is preoccupied at the moment, but the administration is almost certain to circle back to Snyder and the nickname issue.         \n\nThis is not the first time groups have objected to the nickname.         \n\nI covered my first  \n in January 1992 \u2014 Washington versus Buffalo, in Minneapolis \u2014 and attended two protests sponsored by the  \n, a civil rights group. One was at the University of Minnesota, objecting to the University of Illinois\u2019s use of an Indian mascot. On Super Bowl Sunday, the group demonstrated in front of the Metrodome.         \n\nThis time, protesters have a sympathetic ear in the White House, perhaps because the president is a member of a minority group that is all too familiar with the deleterious effect of stereotypes and slurs.         \n\nIn addition to sounding like Wallace, Snyder is aligning himself philosophically with George Preston Marshall, the original owner of the Washington franchise.         \n\nBy the 1961 season, Marshall\u2019s was the only N.F.L. team not to have a black player on the roster. In October 1961, Stewart Udall, the secretary of the interior, said he would not attend a Washington game as long as the N.A.A.C.P. was picketing. Udall warned Marshall that his team would be prohibited from using the new federally owned stadium in the capital the next season unless it hired a black player.         \n\nPolitical pressure has a way of getting the attention of even wealthy team owners. In the next draft, Washington chose two black players: Ernie Davis, the Heisman Trophy winner from Syracuse, at No. 1, and Ron Hatcher, a fullback from Michigan State, in the eighth round.         \n\nWashington was the beneficiary of an unearned and tragic break. Davis was traded to Cleveland for Bobby Mitchell, but Davis was found to have leukemia and died, never playing a down in the N.F.L. Mitchell had a Hall of Fame career in Washington and was one of a long line of outstanding black players for the franchise.         \n\nIn the 1987 season, Washington\u2019s Doug Williams became the first black quarterback to lead his team to a Super Bowl victory.         \n\nMarshall and Wallace were on the wrong side of history. Wallace created an atmosphere of fear, hatred and divisiveness. Marshall barred players who could have helped his franchise avoid mediocrity during the 1950s and 1960s.         \n\nSnyder might object to being placed alongside Wallace and Marshall. By his insistence on using a term that offends even one person, however, he contributes to an atmosphere of intolerance and bigotry. Snyder has an opportunity to get on the right side of history, though I don\u2019t expect someone as vain as he appears to be to change his team\u2019s nickname voluntarily.         \n\nHis refusal to change an offensive name is emblematic of our society\u2019s tendency to wrap ourselves in the armor of self-interest regardless of who might be wounded or offended.         \n\nSports has historically been a vehicle to bring us together. Increasingly, the enterprise is becoming one more tool of divisiveness.         \n\nThose of us who are appealing to Snyder\u2019s sense of ethics and morals are barking up the wrong tree. If this were about morality, Snyder would not need surveys and handpicked American Indians to validate his point. He would stand alone on principle.         \n\nSnyder\u2019s fight is an economic issue, revolving around licensing, marketing and branding. His stridency is based in money, not morality.         \n\nWhen you follow your wallet and ignore your conscience, you\u2019re headed for moral bankruptcy.
