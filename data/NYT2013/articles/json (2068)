{"headline": "Too Old to Get Rich?", "body": "\nI wonder why nobody has ever asked me to write a personal finance column, given that I\u2019ve done so well in this area. The mortgage on my apartment is paid off. I have no debts. I have enough money in the bank that I can live decently until 93, unless I\u2019m flattened by a truck and the hospital doesn\u2019t take my secondary insurance:         \n\n\u201c \u2018Blue Cross\u2019? Never heard of it. Orderly, take this deadbeat to the gutter to die.\u201d         \n\n\u201cNo, no wait! I still have a few hundred thousand dollars left! Couldn\u2019t you get me a semiprivate gutter? A gutter with cable? And you can smother me with a pillow when my money runs out in three days.\u201d         \n\nMy friends are always asking me my financial secrets and I tell them first, never be wasteful. The home is an excellent place to start.         \n\nFor instance, when I get down to the bottom of a jar of honey and the honey has crystalized, rather than toss it out I put a tablespoon of water into the jar and put it into the microwave to make the honey liquid again. Then I spend $1,170 for an upgrade to business on a flight to Budapest. But I don\u2019t worry about the cost, because by keeping an eye on the little things I get an extra 5 cents worth of honey per jar and the minute I buy my 23,401st jar of honey, that upgrade will be paid for.         \n\nExcuse me a minute, my phone is ringing, that\u2019s Alan Greenspan. He can\u2019t make a move without checking with me.         \n\n \n  \n         \n\nWhere was I?         \n\nAnother very important thing is to be sensitive to great deals. One of the finest I ever came across was on Match.com. I didn\u2019t have a single date but they had a great deal where if you didn\u2019t meet anyone after six months, they would give you an additional six months free. This may have been the ultimate deal. Our service was useless? Let us give you six more useless months.         \n\nOh, darn. There\u2019s Joseph Stiglitz pestering me again.         \n\n \n         \n\nSenior discounts. Do you love yours? I love mine.         \n\nI could not wait to hit my 60s and get into the movies at the senior rate, although my friend Herb insists that because to an 18-year-old ticket clerk anyone over 40 is ancient I could have been doing this for years. What I say to this is, \u201cHerb, do I strike you as the sort of person who is going to rip off a place that offers me Junior Mints for four dollars?\u201d         \n\nI also always take advantage of the cinema club cards. For instance, after going to about 500 films at my local Gazillaplex, I got a ticket stub that I thought entitled me to free popcorn with soda, probably because that\u2019s what was written on it, but it turned out to be free popcorn  \n you bought a soda. Who would mind paying $6 for a soda? A few hundred movies later, I qualified for a free small popcorn, which balanced it all out.         \n\nI\u2019m sorry, I have to take this, it\u2019s an overseas call from Greece: Yannis Stournaras, the minister of finance.         \n\n \n         \n\nWhere was I? Senior discounts. You would be amazed how many supermarkets offer them but don\u2019t advertise it. You just have to ask. For instance on Sundays I get a 10 percent discount at my local fancy food shop, which brings their prices to about only about 5 percent higher than a regular supermarket. It also clears the shelves for the new produce that comes in Monday, so we all win. And I never have to wait for the fruit to ripen, because it is so ripe I can eat it that day. In fact, I have to.         \n\nAnd finally, do not be afraid to take on the big guys. Yes, I\u2019m talking the banks. Just a few weeks ago, I needed new checks and a representative of a certain bank \u2014 l don\u2019t want to name names \u2014 told me it would cost $24.99. I demanded to see a manager and informed him that I had $60,000 in their bank and there was no way I was going to pay for something that should be given as a courtesy. And after about 15 minutes, he agreed.         \n\nThen I went back to a money machine just to take a look at all my interest piling up at 0.10 percent and recall my triumph. Take that, you fat-cat plutocrats! Who\u2019s laughing now?
