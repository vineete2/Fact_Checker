{"headline": "How Did You Handle Grandparents\u2019 Unsolicited Parenting Advice?", "body": "\n\u201cYou\u2019re picking him up too much.\u201d         \n\n\u201cAre you nursing the baby again? You\u2019ll spoil her!\u201d         \n\n\u201cCloth diapers? The whole reason someone invented disposables was so we wouldn\u2019t have to deal with those!\u201d         \n\n\u201cAre you sure that soy formula is enough for him? He keeps crying.\u201d         \n\nThere is nothing like the arrival of a baby to crystallize the child-rearing views of everyone around a new parent \u2014 especially the views of that parent\u2019s own parents, or parents-in-law. Suddenly, everyone knows exactly how it should be done (whatever \u201cit\u201d is). At the very least, they certainly know how they did it \u2014 or how they remember doing it, which I\u2019ve always suspected is a very different thing.         \n\nIn this installment of the \u201cNew Parent, Old Parent\u201d partnership between the  \n and  \n blogs, I, the New Parent, am asking the question: What\u2019s a new parent to do when the grandparents give too much advice about the baby?         \n\nIf a new mother nurses when her own mother used formula, or a new father carries a baby in a sling while the stroller was good enough for his dad, it\u2019s not always a simple case of \u201cdifferent people do things differently.\u201d When we new parents do things differently, our parents might feel judged \u2014 are we rejecting the way we were raised? Or they might have safety fears \u2014 is the sling safe? Is soy formula really as good as dairy? The results can range from mild discord to the kind of things some new parents would consider unforgivable, like slipping a breastfed baby a bottle of formula, or  \n (there are still some grandparents out there who consider their arms safer than the Britax).         \n\nBut from the grandparents\u2019 point of view, why not share the lessons learned in the many years of parenting that led to this moment: their child, holding their grandchild? There is nothing more frustrating than watching your sleepless son or daughter reinvent the wheel when you\u2019re certain you could help get that baby sleeping more soundly, or at least more often. In fact, isn\u2019t that the point of \u201cNew Parent, Old Parent\u201d \u2014 to share that cross-generational wisdom? It is, but we note that it\u2019s far, far easier to take advice when those giving the advice didn\u2019t bring years of family baggage along and settle down in the guest room.         \n\nAs when we asked  \n we\u2019re asking boomer parents who have seen this through to exchange ideas with Motherlode parents who are in the thick of it.         \n\nIf you\u2019ve survived the generational disputes that are so often part of the territory for new parents and grandparents, please tell us how you smiled, nodded and went your own way \u2014 or managed to tell your mother to take her formula stash back to the store. And if you\u2019ve been on the grandparent end, and emerged with your relationships with your children and their spouses intact, what was the secret to raising your children through their own entry into parenthood?         \n\n \n, and I\u2019ll round up some of the most intriguing responses (and maybe a few of the best stories) and post them on Motherlode next Friday. Then, the following week, I\u2019ll pass the baton back to my Old Parent colleague, Michael Winerip.
