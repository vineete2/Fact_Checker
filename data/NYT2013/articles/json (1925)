{"headline": " Chinese to Invest in British Nuclear Power ", "body": "\nLONDON \u2014 Britain said on Thursday that it would allow Chinese firms to buy stakes in British nuclear power plants and eventually acquire majority holdings.         \n\nThe agreement, which comes with caveats, opens the way for China\u2019s fast-growing nuclear industry to play a significant role in Britain\u2019s plans to proceed with construction of its first new reactor in nearly two decades.         \n\nGeorge Osborne, chancellor of the Exchequer, made the announcement on Thursday while visiting a nuclear power station in southern China.         \n\nThe project fits into Britain\u2019s overall plan to deliver at least 12 new nuclear reactors at five sites by 2030. It contradicts countries like Germany and Japan that have pulled back from nuclear power since the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan in 2011. Britain has nine aging nuclear plants.         \n\nUnder an agreement signed by the two countries, British companies like Rolls-Royce and International Nuclear Services could also win a bigger role in China\u2019s nuclear power expansion, according to an e-mail from the British Embassy in Beijing that summarized Mr. Osborne\u2019s statement.         \n\nChina is already moving ahead with its own ambitious plan to build dozens of domestic nuclear power stations in coming years. China has 17 reactors now.         \n\nAfter an earthquake and tsunami led to partial meltdowns of three nuclear reactors in Fukushima, China imposed a moratorium on construction for many months. The pace of construction has not fully recovered, and China has since reduced its target for nuclear power capacity in 2015 to 40 gigawatts, from 50.         \n\nChina\u2019s interest in the British nuclear industry signals a break from a mostly domestic focus. While China has engaged in extensive cooperation with Pakistan in nuclear power, its industry has mostly concentrated on an enormous building program at home.         \n\nMr. Osborne\u2019s announcement incited a debate over which type of strategic assets European countries should open to investment from China.         \n\n\u201cCooperation on civil nuclear energy with China has been going on for a long time, and there are many French companies working with the Chinese on these issues, so it\u2019s not something I find difficult to accept,\u201d said Michel Barnier, the European commissioner responsible for the internal markets, speaking in London.         \n\nBut, Mr. Barnier, added, \u201cThe only point I would make is that it is in Europe\u2019s general interest that Europeans reflect on what are their strategic assets. Each country has its own vision of what is strategically important and I think it would be useful to have more of a common vision or strategy on this question.\u201d         \n\nBritain\u2019s energy market is already dominated by European giants, including E.D.F., the French state-controlled power company that is supposed to oversee construction and eventually operate the proposed Hinkley Point project in southwest England, and the German utility E.On. Opening its nuclear power industry to Chinese investment raises questions over Beijing\u2019s influence in a highly sensitive energy sector.         \n\nThe British government said that any Chinese investments had to meet strict standards for safety and security. Chinese investors will most likely have a minority stake in the Hinkley Point project, the government indicated Thursday, adding that \u201cOver time, stakes in subsequent new power stations could be majority stakes.\u201d         \n\nAntony Froggatt, a senior research fellow at Chatham House, a research institute in London, said there were few concerns with a Chinese role because of the partnership with the French in China. \u201cIf there were a falling-out politically, I think they would be more likely to withdraw funding than to switch off the lights,\u201d he said.         \n\nWhile Germany wants to shut all of its nuclear plants by 2022 and shift almost entirely to wind and solar power by 2050, Britain is betting big on nuclear power. Though it is also pushing into production of shale oil and gas, Britain aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by the mid-2020s in large part by renewing the older nuclear power plants.
