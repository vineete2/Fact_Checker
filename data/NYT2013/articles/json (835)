{"headline": "House Defeats Effort to Rein In N.S.A. Data Gathering", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A deeply divided House defeated legislation Wednesday that would have blocked the  \n from collecting vast amounts of phone records, handing the Obama administration a hard-fought victory in the first Congressional showdown over the N.S.A.\u2019s surveillance activities since Edward J. Snowden\u2019s security breaches last month.         \n\nThe 205-to-217 vote was far closer than expected and came after a brief but impassioned debate over citizens\u2019 right to privacy and the steps the government must take to protect national security. It was a rare instance in which a classified intelligence program was openly discussed on the House floor, and disagreements over the \u00a0program led to some unusual coalitions.         \n\nConservative Republicans leery of what they see as Obama administration abuses of power teamed up with liberal Democrats long opposed to intrusive intelligence programs. The Obama administration made common cause with the House Republican leadership to try to block it.         \n\nHouse members pressing to rein in the N.S.A. vowed afterward that the outrage unleashed by Mr. Snowden\u2019s disclosures would eventually put a brake on the agency\u2019s activities. Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and a longtime critic of post-Sept. 11 counterterrorism efforts, said lawmakers would keep coming back with legislation to curtail the dragnets for \u201cmetadata,\u201d whether through phone records or Internet surveillance.         \n\nAt the very least, the section of the  \n in question will be allowed to expire in 2015, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to end \u2014 now or later,\u201d Mr. Nadler said. \u201cThe only question is when and on what terms.\u201d         \n\nRepresentative Mike Rogers of Michigan, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, promised lawmakers that he would draft legislation this fall to add more privacy protections to government surveillance programs even as he begged the House to oppose blanket restrictions.         \n\nThe amendment to the annual Defense Department spending bill, written by Representatives Justin Amash, a libertarian Republican from Western Michigan, and John Conyers Jr., a veteran liberal Democrat from Detroit, turned Democrat against Democrat and Republican against Republican.         \n\nIt would have limited N.S.A. phone surveillance to specific targets of law enforcement investigations, not broad dragnets. It was only one of a series of proposals \u2014 including restricting funds for Syrian rebels and adding Congressional oversight to foreign aid to Egypt \u2014 intended to check  \n\u2019s foreign and intelligence policies.         \n\nBut in the phone surveillance program, the House\u2019s right and left wings appeared to find a unifying cause. Representative Ra\u00fal R. Labrador, Republican of Idaho, called it \u201cthe wing nut coalition\u201d and Mr. Amash \u201cthe chief wing nut.\u201d         \n\nMr. Amash framed his push as a defense of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure, and he found a surprising ally, Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., Republican of Wisconsin and one of the principal authors of the Patriot Act. Mr. Sensenbrenner said his handiwork was never meant to create a program that allows the government to demand the phone records of every American.         \n\n\u201cThe time has come to stop it,\u201d Mr. Sensenbrenner said.         \n\nOpposing them were not only Mr. Obama and the House speaker, John A. Boehner of Ohio, but also the leaders of the nation\u2019s defense and intelligence establishment.         \n\nOn Tuesday, the director of the National Security Agency, Gen. Keith Alexander, spent hours providing classified briefings to lawmakers about the program, and the White House took the unusual step of issuing a statement urging lawmakers not to approve the measure. On Wednesday, James L. Jones, the retired Marine Corps general who was Mr. Obama\u2019s national security adviser from 2009-10, added his name to an  \n that more than half a dozen top national-security officials from the Bush administration had signed.         \n\n\u201cDenying the N.S.A. such access to data will leave the nation at risk,\u201d said the letter, which was circulated to undecided members.         \n\nMr. Rogers took a personal swipe at Mr. Amash, a darling of social media, when he said the House was not in the business of racking up \u201clikes\u201d on Facebook. He said the calling log program was an important tool for protecting against terrorist attacks.         \n\n\u201cThis is not a game,\u201d he fumed. \u201cThis is real. It will have real consequences.\u201d         \n\nBut many rank-and-file Republicans and Democrats appeared impervious to such overtures. Representative Jared Polis, Democrat of Colorado and a supporter of the amendment, said that if the Obama administration felt strongly about defending the program, Mr. Obama would have spoken out personally. Instead, the White House released a statement under the name of the press secretary, Jay Carney.         \n\n\u201cThe press secretary says hundreds of things every day,\u201d Mr. Polis said.         \n\nThe divisions in Congress seemed to reflect the ambivalence in the nation. In a CBS News poll released Wednesday, 67 percent of Americans said the government\u2019s collection of phone records was a violation of privacy. At the same time, 52 percent called it a necessary tool to help find terrorists.         \n\nBut the final tally in the House suggested the tide was shifting on the issue. In the weeks after the Snowden leaks, the united voices of Congressional leaders and administration officials in support of the N.S.A. programs seemed to squelch the outrage Mr. Snowden had hoped for. Anger seemed to be trained more on Mr. Snowden than on the programs he revealed.         \n\nAs the news media and the government chronicled Mr. Snowden\u2019s flight from law enforcement, a web of privacy activists, libertarian conservatives and liberal civil liberties proponents rallied support behind Congressional action. House members said they received hundreds of phone calls and e-mails before Wednesday\u2019s vote, all in favor of curtailing the N.S.A.\u2019s authority.         \n\nUltimately, 94 House Republicans defied their leadership; 111 Democrats \u2014 a majority of the Democratic caucus \u2014 defied their president.         \n\n\u201cThis is only the beginning,\u201d Mr. Conyers vowed after the vote. The fight will shift to the Senate, where two longtime Democratic critics of N.S.A. surveillance, Mark Udall of Colorado and Ron Wyden of Oregon, immediately took up the cause.         \n\n\u201cNational security is of paramount importance, yet the N.S.A.\u2019s dragnet collection of Americans\u2019 phone records violates innocent Americans\u2019 privacy rights and should not continue as its exists today,\u201d Mr. Udall said after the vote. \u201cThe  \n\u2019 bipartisan vote today proposal should be a wake-up call for the White House.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/25/us/politics/house-defeats-effort-to-rein-in-nsa-data-gathering.html", "date": "2013-07-24", "description": "The 217-205 vote was far closer than expected and displayed the shifting allegiances and fierce lobbying on both sides of the issue."}
