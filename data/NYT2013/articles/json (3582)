{"headline": "In October, Showcasing a Thriving Sport That\u2019s Not Football", "body": "\nATLANTA \u2014 In a happy little coincidence for a team that deserves one, the Pittsburgh Pirates have this Sunday all to themselves. The Steelers, their  \n neighbors on the city\u2019s North Shore, are off this weekend. A fall Sunday in Pittsburgh, with only baseball on the schedule? Imagine that.         \n\nAnyone lucky enough to be at PNC Park on Tuesday will not forget the experience. The stands rattled and hummed, the fans unleashing two decades of frustration on the Cincinnati Reds, unnerving an ace starter and expediting the firing of a rival manager.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to A.F.C. playoffs, A.F.C. championship games,\u201d Neil Walker, the Pirates\u2019 second baseman and a native son of Pittsburgh, said afterward, drenched in Champagne. \u201cThere were only 40,000 in the stands, but I\u2019m pretty sure this was the loudest. This was absolutely incredible.\u201d         \n\nThe comparison of baseball to the N.F.L., in cities like Pittsburgh and the country as a whole, is never far from the surface. The notion that football rules and baseball is pass\u00e9 has persisted for decades, never mind that the fundamental difference in the sports \u2014 the schedules \u2014 invalidates the premise.         \n\nOne sport has 16 games and plays once a week. The other has 162 games and plays almost every day. Both are fascinating and fun to watch, and loyalties are passed down through generations. The one with 10 times the scarcity, naturally, has higher ratings and draws bigger crowds to its individual games. The one with more dates to sell, naturally, has more total viewers and ticket buyers, taking the entire schedule into account. Those who bash baseball forget the second part.         \n\nBaseball has problems, like every industry. It may not have a transcendent, crossover star in his prime \u2014 think Tom Brady or LeBron James \u2014 but, again, consider the nature of the sport. The positional equivalent of the quarterback, the starting pitcher, changes every day. And even the best hitters come to bat only once per nine players through the order. Basketball stars, in theory, can shoot every trip down the court.         \n\nThe point is that baseball is a different game that defies traditional comparisons. In every way besides national postseason television ratings, the game is thriving, and the real effect of those low ratings is generally overstated. Last year, baseball reached an eight-year deal with Fox, ESPN and TBS for its national rights fees. The value of that contract was $12.4 billion, a 100 percent increase over the previous deal.         \n\nWith so much revenue floating around, every team has a path to success and a good chance to keep its star players. The A\u2019s qualified for the postseason, like other small-market teams in Tampa Bay, Cleveland, Cincinnati and Pittsburgh. Yet while the playoff field has expanded in the last 20 years, to 10 teams from four, it remains more exclusive than those in the N.F.L. and the N.B.A.         \n\n\u201cEven though the wild card has diminished the classic pennant race, the trade-off has been worth it, especially with the second wild card,\u201d NBC\u2019s Bob Costas said. \u201cNow, more teams have a chance late in the season, and there is a marked difference between being first \u2014 especially if you have the best record in the league \u2014 and being a wild card. The fact is, more teams are alive.         \n\n\u201cRealignment, the wild cards, revenue sharing and widespread use of \u2018Moneyball\u2019 techniques haven\u2019t leveled the playing field, but they\u2019ve narrowed the gap considerably.\u201d         \n\nTwenty-six of the 30 teams \u2014 all but Kansas City, Miami, Seattle and Toronto \u2014 have reached the playoffs in the last eight seasons. The smallest market in the majors, Milwaukee, has averaged more than 31,000 fans a game in each of the last seven seasons. Half the teams in the majors drew at least 2.5 million this season, and most now play in modern, charming downtown ballparks.         \n\nFranchise values are exploding. Last year, a group led by Mark Walter, Magic Johnson and Stan Kasten bought the Los Angeles Dodgers for $2.15 billion. Then they reached a local TV deal that could be worth $8 billion over 25 years.
