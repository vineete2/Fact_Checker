{"headline": "Strict Gun Laws in Chicago Can\u2019t Stem Fatal Shots", "body": "\nCHICAGO \u2014 Not a single gun shop can be found in this city because they are outlawed. Handguns were banned in Chicago for decades, too, until 2010, when the United States Supreme Court ruled that was going too far, leading city leaders to settle for restrictions some describe as the closest they could get legally to a ban without a ban. Despite a continuing legal fight, Illinois remains the only state in the nation with no provision to let private citizens carry guns in public.         \n\nAnd yet Chicago, a city with no civilian gun ranges and bans on both assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, finds itself laboring to stem a flood of gun violence that contributed to more than 500 homicides last year and at least 40 killings already in 2013, including a fatal shooting of a 15-year-old girl on Tuesday.         \n\nTo gun rights advocates, the city provides stark evidence that even some of the toughest restrictions fail to make places safer. \u201cThe gun laws in Chicago only restrict the law-abiding citizens and they\u2019ve essentially made the citizens prey,\u201d said  \n, executive director of the  \n. To gun control proponents, the struggles here underscore the opposite \u2014 a need for strict, uniform national gun laws to eliminate the current patchwork of state and local rules that allow guns to flow into this city from outside.         \n\n\u201cChicago is like a house with two parents that may try to have good rules and do what they can, but it\u2019s like you\u2019ve got this single house sitting on a whole block where there\u2019s anarchy,\u201d said the Rev. Ira J. Acree, one among a group of pastors here who have marched and gathered signatures for an end to so much shooting. \u201cChicago is an argument for laws that are statewide or, better yet, national.\u201d         \n\nChicago\u2019s experience reveals the complications inherent in carrying out local gun laws around the nation. Less restrictive laws in neighboring communities and states not only make guns easy to obtain nearby, but layers of differing laws \u2014 local and state \u2014 make it difficult to police violations. And though many describe the local and state gun laws here as relatively stringent, penalties for violating them \u2014 from jail time to fines \u2014 have not proven as severe as they are in some other places, reducing the incentive to comply.         \n\nLately, the police say they are discovering far more guns on the streets of Chicago than in the nation\u2019s two more populous cities, Los Angeles and New York. They seized 7,400 guns here in crimes or unpermitted uses last year (compared with 3,285 in New York City), and have confiscated 574 guns just since Jan. 1 \u2014 124 of them last week alone.         \n\nMore than a quarter of the firearms seized on the streets here by the Chicago Police Department over the past five years were bought just outside city limits in Cook County suburbs, according to an analysis by the University of Chicago Crime Lab. Others came from stores around Illinois and from other states, like Indiana, less than an hour\u2019s drive away. Since 2008, more than 1,300 of the confiscated guns, the analysis showed, were bought from just one store, Chuck\u2019s Gun Shop in Riverdale, Ill., within a few miles of Chicago\u2019s city limits.         \n\nEfforts to compare the strictness of gun laws and the level of violence across major American cities are fraught with contradiction and complication, not least because of varying degrees of coordination between local and state laws and differing levels of enforcement. In New York City, where homicides and shootings have decreased, the gun laws are generally seen as at least as strict as Chicago\u2019s, and the state laws in New York and many of its neighboring states are viewed as still  \n than those in and around Illinois. Philadelphia, like cities in many states, is limited in writing gun measures that go beyond those set by Pennsylvania law. Some city officials there have chafed under what they see as relatively lax state controls.         \n\nIn Chicago, the rules for owning a handgun \u2014 rewritten after the outright ban was deemed too restrictive in 2010 \u2014 sound arduous. Owners must seek a Chicago firearms permit, which requires firearms training, a background check and a state-mandated firearm owner\u2019s identification card, which requires a different background review for felonies and mental illness. To prevent straw buyers from selling or giving their weapons to people who would not meet the restrictions \u2014 girlfriends buying guns for gang members is a common problem, the police here say \u2014 the city requires permitted gun owners to report their weapons lost, sold or stolen.         \n\nStill, for all the regulations, the reality here looks different. Some 7,640 people currently hold a firearms permit, but nearly that many illicit weapons were confiscated from the city\u2019s streets during last year alone. Chicago officials say Illinois has no requirement, comparable to Chicago\u2019s, that gun owners immediately report their lost or stolen weapons to deter straw buyers. Consequently those outside the city can, in the words of one city official, carry guns to gang members in the city with \u201czero accountability.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/us/strict-chicago-gun-laws-cant-stem-fatal-shots.html", "date": "2013-01-29", "description": "The city\u2019s experience has revealed the complications inherent in carrying out local gun laws around the United States."}
