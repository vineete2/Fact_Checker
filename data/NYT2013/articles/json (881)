{"headline": "The Promise of More Than Perfection", "body": "\nEven as a boy growing up in the Midwest, I was interested in food and cooking. Supermarket expeditions to the local A.&P. were entertaining, and so was racing along the aisles astride the shopping cart.         \n\nI had a working knowledge of our shopping list early on, and could be relied on to track down my family\u2019s pantry staples. Our meals were fairly predictable, and my mother\u2019s repertory was somewhat limited. Each night, we had a different kind of protein (Swiss steak, meatloaf, broiled chicken thighs) and an appropriate \u201cstarch,\u201d often Tater Tots or egg noodles.         \n\nRice came in an orange box that promised perfection every time. It could be served plain, but the rice itself had no particular flavor. We liked to turn it into pilaf, which required adding two foil packets of dehydrated soup: French onion and chicken noodle.         \n\nDuring summer months, we drove out to Mumma\u2019s farm stand for fresh-picked green beans, cabbage and fat ears of sweet corn. Corn on the cob was a seasonal treat; otherwise, our vegetables were canned or frozen for the most part.         \n\nThings changed considerably when I ventured out into the world and began to rub elbows with cooks operating on a different plane, folks who lived to eat and loved to prowl for provisions. In San Francisco, I met Niloufer Ichaporia King, who became a friend and mentor. She took me under her wing and shared an abundance of wisdom gleaned from kitchens in her native Bombay, today\u2019s Mumbai.         \n\nRice, I discovered, could have real flavor, especially Basmati rice, which had a sweet fragrance and delicate texture. We would traipse off to the Indian grocery to get the best aged Basmati, then wash it carefully and let it soak for a half-hour before cooking. Corn, I learned, was as beloved in India as in North America, and it could come off the cob to go into a pilaf (or pulao, as she called it), enhanced with whole spices \u2014 clove, cardamom and cumin. Did I know about the many types of raita, a sauce made with yogurt, the perfect accompaniment for so many Indian dishes? I happily chopped by her side as she cooked dish after incredible dish from memory.         \n\nThe other night, after the sun had set on a particularly sweltering day, I made a version of the corn pilaf. Though it might have been good with roast chicken or grilled chops, a lighter meatless meal seemed a better choice. So the rice was served with a vibrant green salad, a platter of sliced ripe tomatoes and a cooling bowl of that raita on the side.
