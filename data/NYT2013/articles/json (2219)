Like other employers across the country, the firm hires only people with a bachelor\u2019s degree, even for jobs that do not require college-level skills.         \n\nThis prerequisite applies to everyone, including the receptionist, paralegals, administrative assistants and file clerks. Even the office \u201crunner\u201d \u2014 the in-house courier who, for $10 an hour, ferries documents back and forth between the courthouse and the office \u2014 went to a four-year school.         \n\n\u201cCollege graduates are just more career-oriented,\u201d said Adam Slipakoff, the firm\u2019s managing partner. \u201cGoing to college means they are making a real commitment to their futures. They\u2019re not just looking for a paycheck.\u201d         \n\nEconomists have referred to this phenomenon as \u201cdegree inflation,\u201d and it has been steadily infiltrating America\u2019s job market. Across industries and geographic areas, many other jobs that didn\u2019t used to require a diploma \u2014 positions like dental hygienists, cargo agents, clerks and claims adjusters \u2014 are increasingly requiring one,  \n, a company that analyzes job ads from more than 20,000 online sources, including major job boards and small- to midsize-employer sites.         \n\nThis up-credentialing is pushing the less educated even further down the food chain, and it helps explain why the unemployment rate for workers with no more than a high school diploma is more than twice that for workers with a bachelor\u2019s degree:  \n versus 3.7 percent.         \n\nSome jobs, like those in supply chain management and logistics, have become more technical, and so require more advanced skills today than they did in the past. But more broadly, because so many people are going to college now, those who do not graduate are often assumed to be unambitious or less capable.         \n\nPlus, it\u2019s a buyer\u2019s market for employers.         \n\n\u201cWhen you get 800 r\u00e9sum\u00e9s for every job ad, you need to weed them out somehow,\u201d said Suzanne Manzagol, executive recruiter at Cardinal Recruiting Group, which does headhunting for administrative positions at Busch, Slipakoff & Schuh and other firms in the Atlanta area.         \n\nOf all the metropolitan areas in the United States, Atlanta has had one of the largest inflows of college graduates in the last five years, according to an analysis of census data by William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution. In 2012, 39 percent of job postings for secretaries and administrative assistants in the Atlanta metro area requested a bachelor\u2019s degree, up from 28 percent in 2007, according to Burning Glass.         \n\n\u201cWhen I started recruiting in \u201906, you didn\u2019t need a college degree, but there weren\u2019t that many candidates,\u201d Ms. Manzagol said.         \n\nEven if they are not exactly applying the knowledge they gained in their political science, finance and fashion marketing classes, the young graduates employed by Busch, Slipakoff & Schuh say they are grateful for even the rotest of rote office work they have been given.         \n\n\u201cIt sure beats washing cars,\u201d said Landon Crider, 24, the firm\u2019s soft-spoken runner.         \n\nHe would know: he spent several years, while at Georgia State and in the months after graduation, scrubbing sedans at Enterprise Rent-a-Car. Before joining the law firm, he was turned down for a promotion to rental agent at Enterprise \u2014 a position that also required a bachelor\u2019s degree \u2014 because the company said he didn\u2019t have enough sales experience.         \n\nHis college-educated colleagues had similarly limited opportunities, working at Ruby Tuesday or behind a retail counter while waiting for a better job to open up.         \n\n\u201cI am over $100,000 in  \n debt right now,\u201d said Megan Parker, who earns $37,000 as the firm\u2019s receptionist. She graduated from the Art Institute of Atlanta in 2011 with a degree in fashion and retail management, and spent months waiting on \u201cbridezillas\u201d at a couture boutique, among other stores, while churning out office-job applications.         \n\n\u201cI will probably never see the end of that bill, but I\u2019m not really thinking about it right now,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, this is a really great place to work.\u201d         \n\nThe risk with hiring college graduates for jobs they are supremely overqualified for is, of course, that they will leave as soon as they find something better, particularly as the economy improves.         \n\nMr. Slipakoff said his firm had little turnover, though, largely because of its rapid expansion. The company has grown to more than 30 lawyers from five in 2008, plus a support staff of about 15, and promotions have abounded.         \n\n\u201cThey expect you to grow, and they want you to grow,\u201d said Ashley Atkinson, who graduated from Georgia Southern University in 2009 with a general studies degree. \u201cYou\u2019re not stuck here under some glass ceiling.\u201d         \n\nWithin a year of being hired as a file clerk, around Halloween 2011, Ms. Atkinson was promoted twice to positions in marketing and office management. Mr. Crider, the runner, was given additional work last month, helping with copying and billing claims. He said he was taking the opportunity to learn more about the legal industry, since he plans to apply to law school next year.         \n\nThe firm\u2019s greatest success story is Laura Burnett, who in less than a year went from being a file clerk to being the firm\u2019s paralegal for the litigation group. The partners were so impressed with her filing wizardry that they figured she could handle it.         \n\n\u201cThey gave me a raise, too,\u201d said Ms. Burnett, a 2011 graduate of the University of West Georgia.         \n\nThe typical paralegal position, which has traditionally offered a path to a well-paying job for less educated workers, requires no more than an associate degree, according to the Labor Department\u2019s  \n, but the job is still a step up from filing. Of the three daughters in her family, Ms. Burnett reckons that she has the best job. One sister, a fellow West Georgia graduate, is processing insurance claims; another, who dropped out of college, is one of the many degree-less young people who still cannot find work.         \n\nBesides the promotional pipelines it creates, setting a floor of college attainment also creates more office camaraderie, said Mr. Slipakoff, who handles most of the firm\u2019s hiring and is especially partial to his fellow University of Florida graduates. There is a lot of trash-talking of each other\u2019s college football teams, for example. And this year the office\u2019s Christmas tree ornaments were a colorful menagerie of college mascots \u2014  \n,  \n,  \n,  \n,  \n,  \n,  \n \u2014 in which just about every staffer\u2019s school was represented.         \n\n\u201cYou know, if we had someone here with just a G.E.D. or something, I can see how they might feel slighted by the social atmosphere here,\u201d he says. \u201cThere really is something sort of cohesive or binding about the fact that all of us went to college.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/20/business/college-degree-required-by-increasing-number-of-companies.html", "date": "2013-02-19", "description": "These days, Busch, Slipakoff & Schuh, a law firm in Atlanta, hires only people with a bachelor\u2019s degree \u2014 no exceptions.
