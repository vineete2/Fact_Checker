{"headline": "Who Made That Android Logo?", "body": "\nIrina Blok may have drawn one of the most recognized logos in the world, but her association with the green Android has not made her famous. Blok can think of only one incident when she garnered the public\u2019s attention for designing it. In 2010, she and her 6-year-old daughter were in a movie theater waiting for \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d to begin when an Android logo flashed on the screen. Her daughter, Blok recalls, suddenly stood up and yelled, \u201cMy mommy invented that!\u201d Everyone in the row in front of them turned around to stare. Blok was so embarrassed, she says, that she sank down behind her tub of popcorn.         \n\nThe Android logo was born three years earlier, when Blok worked as a designer at Google. As Google prepared to endorse the Android software platform for mobile devices, Blok and her design-team colleagues were told to create a look for the software \u2014 something that consumers could easily identify. The logo, she was told, should involve a robot, and so she studied sci-fi toys and space movies \u2014 anything that might help her create a character. In the end, she took inspiration from a distinctly human source: the pictograms of the universal man and woman that often appear on restroom doors. She drew a stripped-down robot with a tin-can-shaped torso and antennas on his head.         \n\nWhile Blok worked on her design, she and her colleagues agreed that the logo, like the software, should be open-sourced. \u201cWe decided it would be a collaborative logo that everybody in the world could customize,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was pretty daring.\u201d Most companies, of course, defend their trademark from copycats, and million-dollar lawsuits have been filed over the rights to corporate insignia. This one would remain free.         \n\nIn the years since, the Android logo has been dressed up as a ninja, given skis and skateboards and even transformed into a limited-edition Kit-Kat bar. Blok (who is now creative director at Edmodo, a social network for students and teachers) says that creating the logo was like raising a child: \u201cYou give a life to this individual, and then they have a life of their own.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \nSimplicity and timelessness. Those are two very difficult things to achieve. Recently, we\u2019ve seen a lot of companies trying to update their logos \u2014 Yahoo has just introduced its much-debated logo. And AT&T, U.P.S., Pepsi and American Airlines are also giving themselves little face-lifts. But a great logo shouldn\u2019t need any revision. The logos of I.B.M., Nike and FedEx have survived the test of time. That has a lot has to do with their simplicity. I can\u2019t imagine Nike\u2019s logo changing, even in a hundred years; there\u2019s nothing left to subtract.         \n\n \nBetween the letters E and X there is negative space that forms the shape of an arrow. It\u2019s a subtle wink, so at first you don\u2019t notice it. FedEx\u2019s public-relations firm wanted to highlight the arrow so it would be obvious. But the designer, Lindon Leader, fought them on that \u2014 he thought it would be overkill. There\u2019s something about making people discover something on their own that\u2019s a lot more powerful than italicizing it to make your point.         \n\n \n\u00a0The New Museum at the time was opening its new location and new building, and Droga5 \u2014 the ad agency I worked for then \u2014 ended up doing the campaign. We realized the silhouette of the building could become an icon for the entire institution.
