{"headline": "Report of Nazi-Looted Trove Puts Art World in an Uproar", "body": "\nBERLIN \u2014 There was no hint that the older man who called a couple of years back about selling a picture could be sitting on an unimaginable trove of art confiscated or banned by the Nazis. When the proffered work, \u201cLion Tamer\u201d by the German artist Max Beckmann, was collected, the seller seemed to be a proper gentleman in Munich dispensing with a lone, dusty art gem at the end of his life.         \n\nIt was a \u201cfantastic picture,\u201d recalled Karl-Sax Feddersen of the Cologne auction house Lempertz, who noted how pleased the auction house team was with the auction price: 864,000 euros, or $1.17 million.         \n\nWhen he learned on Monday that the Beckmann seller, Cornelius Gurlitt, now 80, had reportedly sat on hundreds of works, including art by Picasso and Matisse, that were confiscated under the Nazis or sold cheaply by owners desperate to flee Hitler, Mr. Feddersen was amazed. \u201cImagine!\u201d he said, envisaging seeing and selling such a collection.         \n\nThe Bavarian authorities swooped in on Mr. Gurlitt\u2019s home and seized about 1,500 works estimated to be worth $1.4 billion, according to  \n. German officials said the raid occurred on Feb. 28, 2012.         \n\nIf confirmed, the discovery would be one of the biggest finds of vanished art in years. But word of it left almost equally big questions unanswered: Why did the German authorities let nearly two years pass before such a sizable find was disclosed? What will become of the recovered works of art? Did Mr. Gurlitt continue to make sales even after the raid? And where is he today?         \n\nThere are no reports that Mr. Gurlitt has been detained or charged, and questions about the history of the artworks, including whether they were confiscated or subject to a forced or voluntary sale, would determine whether a current sale or auction would be judged legitimate.         \n\nSince news of the find was first reported Sunday, the German authorities have come under fierce criticism in the art world as to why they did not make the discovery public.         \n\nEven on Monday, Bavarian and federal German officials who knew of the spectacular raid remained quiet. The German government\u2019s only comment, from a spokesman, Steffen Seibert, was that it was aware of the case. However, the German authorities scheduled a news conference for Tuesday.         \n\n\u201cThey should have come out with this list pronto,\u201d said Jonathan Petropoulos, the author of  \n         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the way that restitution works,\u201d Mr. Petropoulos added, calling it \u201cunconscionable\u201d that the authorities \u201csat on the trove for two and a half years,\u201d particularly because it appeared to be an exceptionally large find.         \n\nThe trail to the artworks, the magazine said, stemmed from an incident in September 2010, when Bavarian customs officials on a train to Germany from Switzerland became suspicious after finding Mr. Gurlitt carrying \u20ac9,000, or about $12,150, in crisp \u20ac500 notes.         \n\nThe inquiries spurred by the money eventually led investigators to the apartment in Munich, the magazine said, reporting that Mr. Gurlitt had apparently lived there for decades, selling off pictures as needed over the years, to judge by empty frames found in his home. Emma Bahlmann, an employee of the Cologne auction house that sold the Beckmann work, said she went to an apartment with Mr. Gurlitt but saw no evidence of other artworks as she took the Beckmann off the wall.         \n\nThe hundreds of works found in the Munich apartment reported to have been raided by authorities \u2014 including paintings but also many graphics and even an engraving by Albrecht D\u00fcrer, the German Renaissance artist \u2014 were taken to a customs facility near Munich for storage, Focus said.  \n, an art historian at an institute specializing in Nazi-confiscated art at the Free University in Berlin, was engaged to go through the discovered works.         \n\nMs. Hoffmann declined to talk to reporters on Sunday or Monday about what she described in an email as \u201cthis case.\u201d         \n\nBut a video of  \n in September, posted on the institute\u2019s website, showed her saying that her institute would soon be doing more work associated with Hildebrand Gurlitt, Cornelius Gurlitt\u2019s father. The elder Mr. Gurlitt had trouble with the Nazis because he was deemed a quarter Jewish under the Nuremberg race laws, and he was dismissed from two museum posts. Yet he was also one of the few Germans granted permission by Joseph Goebbels, Hitler\u2019s propaganda chief, to sell confiscated art. Sales to foreign buyers were meant to fill Nazi coffers, but art historians have documented many sales in Germany, as well as proceeds pocketed by the dealers involved.
