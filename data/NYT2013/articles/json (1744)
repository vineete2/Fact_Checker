So far, no one has gone to prison in the scandal, which emerged in 2005.         \n\n\u201cThe move sets a troubling precedent by raising concerns over a domino effect in many other corruption cases involving powerful figures,\u201d said Ivar Hartmann, a professor of law at Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Get\u00falio Vargas, a top Brazilian university.         \n\nEven before the trial, it was remarkably rare for politicians in Brazil to go to prison after being found guilty of crimes like corruption, kidnapping and employing slave labor, partly because of the  \n enjoyed by about 700 political figures, including senior cabinet ministers and all 594 members of Congress. This standing requires their cases to be heard only in the high court, which is already bogged down by thousands of other cases each year.         \n\nThe system produces years of delays in judging politicians charged with serious crimes. Legal experts said such cases could now drag on indefinitely after a ruling by the high court justices on Wednesday, which allowed appeals of their own votes in these trials.         \n\nThe televised debate over the appeals within the court, the Supreme Federal Tribunal, produced heated moments in recent weeks. Justice Gilmar Mendes said the court was inviting mockery as a \u201cjuvenile tribunal of irresponsible people,\u201d while another justice, Ricardo Lewandowski, argued that the court was merely giving defendants the right to a new appeal.         \n\nGiven the delays that have already characterized the trial, the court\u2019s discussion of the appeals could  \n, Helenita Acioli, the interim prosecutor general, said this month.         \n\nThat may benefit figures like Jos\u00e9 Dirceu de Oliveira e Silva, who was chief of staff for Brazil\u2019s former president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, and sentenced to nearly 11 years in prison for his role in orchestrating the vote-buying scheme, called the mensal\u00e3o, or big monthly allowance, after the regular payments made to legislators in exchange for their votes.         \n\nThe appeals involve a rare legal procedure in which close votes on the high court can be held again. The appeals, which are thought to have originated in the 16th-century legal system of Portugal, Brazil\u2019s former colonial ruler, were abolished there in the 1930s. Few Brazilians had even heard of the appeals until the high court considered them in the mensal\u00e3o trial.         \n\nWhile few convictions are expected to be overturned, defendants are seeking less stringent prison conditions, including arrangements that allow convicts to leave prison during the day to work. Some legal experts held open the possibility that some defendants could avoid jail time altogether if the trial endured long; crimes committed about a decade ago could be exceeded by the statute of limitations.         \n\n\u201cThe stain on their reputations remains,\u201d said Matthew M. Taylor, a scholar at American University in Washington who specializes in Brazil\u2019s legal system. He said the latest twist in their trial was \u201cmore troubling for what it says about Brazil\u2019s courts and their inability to effectively and expeditiously tackle widespread corruption within the political system.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/19/world/americas/brazilian-court-allows-appeals-for-lawmakers-convicted-of-corruption.html", "date": "2013-09-18", "description": "The court ruling allowing the reopening of crucial aspects of the trial suggested that senior political figures convicted in a vast vote-buying scheme may not get any hard jail time."}
