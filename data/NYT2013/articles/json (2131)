{"headline": "Biden Faces a Delicate Two-Step in Asia", "body": "\nTOKYO \u2014 With Japan locked in a tense standoff with China over disputed airspace, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. arrived here late Monday for a weeklong visit to Asia intended to reassure a close ally and demand answers from a potential adversary.         \n\nBut first, Mr. Biden may need to repair a perceived disconnect between the United States and Japan in their responses to China\u2019s  \n over a swath of the East China Sea that includes disputed islands claimed by both Japan and China.         \n\nAnalysts and former diplomats said that reassuring Japan of America\u2019s commitment to the region was particularly important given creeping worries in Tokyo that the United States might no longer have the financial ability, or even the will, to maintain its dominant military position in the Asia-Pacific.         \n\nAlthough the Obama administration registered its displeasure with China\u2019s so-called air defense identification zone by  \n through it, federal regulators, as a safety precaution,  \n before entering the airspace \u2014 in compliance with the Chinese regulations.         \n\nThat was viewed by some in Japan as a mixed message, since the Japanese government had told its airlines to ignore the Chinese demand. Japanese newspapers began worrying about \u201callies no longer walking in lock step,\u201d and government officials sought clarification from Washington.         \n\nThe State Department quickly said that the advice did not mean that the United States was recognizing the air defense zone. And American officials have told the Japanese that the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s decision was a safety recommendation \u2014 far short of an order, though major American airlines said they were heeding it.         \n\nStill, a lingering ambiguity has led Japanese officials to give contradictory assessments of American intentions. On Sunday, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters that his government had confirmed through \u201ca diplomatic route\u201d that the United States had not asked airlines to file flight plans with the Chinese.         \n\n\u201cWhile having a deep discussion of the issues, we hope to respond with close coordination between Japan and the United States,\u201d Mr. Abe said of his scheduled talks on Tuesday with Mr. Biden.         \n\nAdministration officials said earlier that Mr. Biden would leave no doubt in Japan or China that the United States views the Chinese move as a provocation and plans to disregard it, at least as far as military operations go.         \n\n\u201cWe have real concerns with this move by China because it raises real questions about their intentions,\u201d said a senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to avoid pre-empting Mr. Biden\u2019s message. \u201cIt constitutes a unilateral change to the status quo in the region, a region that is already fraught.\u201d         \n\nStill, the official said, Mr. Biden would not deliver a formal diplomatic protest to Beijing, where he is to meet with President Xi Jinping on Wednesday. His aides are determined not to allow the matter to dominate his trip, during which the vice president also hopes to build support for a trans-Pacific trade agreement and coordinate a response to the nuclear threat from North Korea.         \n\nMr. Biden cultivated friendly ties with Mr. Xi when he was China\u2019s vice president. But their encounter this time may be more difficult.         \n\nAnalysts and former diplomats said the Chinese government was already using the recommendation to American airlines to pressure Japan. On Monday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hong Lei, commended the American move as showing \u201ca constructive attitude,\u201d while scolding Japanese criticism of the air zone as \u201cirresponsible.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThe Chinese are already trying to portray this as daylight between the U.S. and Japanese positions, when there actually isn\u2019t any,\u201d said Kevin Maher, a former United States diplomat in Japan who is now a senior adviser at NMV Consulting in New York.         \n\n\u201cThe optics may look bad, but all the U.S. is saying is that we don\u2019t want commercial airliners to take an arrow for the team,\u201d Mr. Maher added. \u201cWe need to make clear that we will keep sending military aircraft into the declared zone.\u201d         \n\nThe tension with China comes at a delicate moment, with the United States pushing Japan to wrap up negotiations on the regional trade deal, the  \n. Inspired by comments Mr. Abe made about the importance of women to the Japanese economy \u2014 and by the new American ambassador to Japan, Caroline Kennedy \u2014 Mr. Biden has left time for a visit to a Japanese company owned and run by a female entrepreneur. He was joined by Ms. Kennedy, who took up her post in Tokyo just three weeks ago.         \n\nFor Mr. Biden, though, the region\u2019s tensions will be inescapable. In addition to the conflict over the disputed islands \u2014 known in Japan as the Senkaku, and in China as the Diaoyu \u2014 Japanese and South Korean leaders are feuding amid a resurgence of animosities that date to Japanese colonialism and World War II.         \n\nBefore taking office, Mr. Abe, a conservative, struck a nerve with statements about Japan\u2019s culpability \u2014 or lack of it \u2014 in the war. Since then, however,  \n, a memorial to the Japanese war dead that has become a fraught symbol because it also honors people who are war criminals. Mr. Biden will likely encourage him to keep staying away.         \n\nWith the United States trying to reinvigorate  \n after he canceled a trip to the region because of the government shutdown, analysts will watch Mr. Biden\u2019s words as a clue to America\u2019s resolve to maintain its military presence here.         \n\n\u201cThe most important thing is for Vice President Biden to show that the U.S. will work on China to end its unilateral actions,\u201d said Ichiro Fujisaki, who served as Japanese ambassador to the United States until last year.
