{"headline": "De Blasio Prods Council to Elect Ally as Speaker", "body": "\nEight years after losing a race for speaker of the City Council, Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio is determined to win one.         \n\nAfter 48 hours of intense behind-the-scenes lobbying, Mr. de Blasio and his allies on the left appeared on Wednesday to have orchestrated the choice of a strong, early supporter and fellow liberal, Melissa Mark-Viverito of East Harlem, as speaker, New York City\u2019s second most powerful elected official.         \n\nArranging to have such a close ally as speaker offers more than a bit of irony for Mr. de Blasio: Throughout the Democratic mayoral primary contest, he accused the departing holder of that office, Christine C. Quinn, of being so eager to gain Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s endorsement for her own mayoral bid that she had been an ineffective counterbalance to his administration.         \n\nYet successfully installing Ms. Mark-Viverito as speaker would give Mr. de Blasio a partner at the controls of the city\u2019s legislative branch \u2014 with the power to speed or obstruct his agenda \u2014 who owed her job to his support.         \n\nMr. de Blasio played down such suggestions on Wednesday, allowing that he had merely offered his \u201cobservations\u201d about the speaker\u2019s race in calls to council members and that they would make their own decisions. Calling them \u201ca very strong-willed group,\u201d he added, \u201cThey\u2019re going to make their presence felt, and they\u2019re going to maintain their independence, I don\u2019t have a doubt about it.\u201d The election is set for Jan. 8.         \n\nBut when asked if he was worried about a Council too closely aligned with the mayor\u2019s office, Mr. de Blasio joked, \u201cWow, what a challenge that would be.\u201d         \n\nBy Wednesday night, Ms. Mark-Viverito was so assured of winning that she issued a statement saying she had the votes necessary to become the speaker. \u201cI am humbled to have the support and confidence that my colleagues have placed in me,\u201d she said, in a statement that included praise from 30 other current and future council members.         \n\nMr. de Blasio\u2019s intervention in the speaker\u2019s race was a departure from recent practice: Mr. Bloomberg and mayors since at least the 1960s had generally stayed out of such leadership struggles.         \n\nYet in some respects it turned into a rematch for Mr. de Blasio. As a two-term councilman in 2005, he ran for speaker and lost to Ms. Quinn, who outmaneuvered him by lining up the support of the powerful county leaders in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens.         \n\nThis week, those leaders lined up behind Councilman Daniel Garodnick of Manhattan, a former securities litigator, who, though quite liberal in his own right, positioned himself as more capable of standing up to Mr. de Blasio than Ms. Mark-Viverito.         \n\nWading into the race was also a gamble for Mr. de Blasio: A defeat for Ms. Mark-Viverito would be an embarrassing setback for a mayor-elect who had claimed an overwhelming mandate.         \n\nBut on Wednesday, that gamble appeared to pay off, as Brooklyn\u2019s Democratic leader, Frank Seddio, threw his support to Ms. Mark-Viverito, 44, a Puerto Rican-born former labor organizer who has advocated for immigrants\u2019 rights and affordable housing as a council member.         \n\nThere are other risks for Mr. de Blasio in imposing his will on the speaker\u2019s contest: Though she has the enthusiastic support of the Council\u2019s newly assertive Progressive Caucus, and is known as a fierce advocate, Ms. Mark-Viverito is often described as headstrong and aloof.         \n\nElected in 2005 after having worked for 1199 SEIU, the health care workers\u2019 union, and at two Hispanic nonprofit groups, she spearheaded legislation allowing tenants to sue landlords for harassment, and protecting some immigrants from being handed over to federal immigration authorities before they have been convicted of any crimes. She pushed for bills mandating that businesses give employees paid sick days, and requiring that corporations that receive city subsidies pay their workers more.
