{"headline": "Nonprofits Are Balking at Law on Disclosing Political Donors", "body": "\nIn an era of enormous, and often secretive, political spending, an  \n championed by Gov.  \n was billed as a major breakthrough: tax-exempt groups that lobby New York State government would finally be required to reveal where they got their money.         \n\nBut two years after the law passed, a growing number of nonprofit organizations, spanning the ideological spectrum, are seeking exemptions, arguing that their donors could be endangered if their names were released to the public.         \n\nThe debate in Albany over which groups should be excluded from the disclosure law is quickly intensifying, echoing disputes over transparency versus privacy in California, Maine, Minnesota and other states.         \n\nIt comes as national political spending by nonprofit groups has increased in the wake of the  \n on campaign finance.         \n\nIn Albany, where even transparency is discussed in secret, the state ethics commission voted behind closed doors to grant an exemption to  \n, a prominent abortion rights group. That lone exemption has prompted Republicans to accuse ethics regulators of favoring liberal organizations.         \n\nThe application by Naral was followed by requests from at least four other groups \u2014 two more supporting abortion rights, a group opposing abortion and  \n, and the New York Civil Liberties Union.         \n\nSome government watchdogs are hoping that the ethics commission takes a tough stance by limiting exemptions.         \n\n\u201cIt can quickly become a slippery slope,\u201d said Dick Dadey, the executive director of Citizens Union, a good-government group. Mr. Dadey said exemptions should be granted \u201conly in rare circumstances,\u201d like \u201cevidence of an actual threat.\u201d         \n\n\u201cOnce you start pulling out one thread and creating an exemption,\u201d he added, \u201cyou risk having the whole network of reporting be undermined.\u201d         \n\nBut the groups seeking exemptions say the potential cost of disclosure is too high.         \n\nAndrea Miller, the president of Naral Pro-Choice New York, said, \u201cEven here in New York, where there\u2019s such extraordinary public support for a woman\u2019s right to choose, our organization has been targeted.\u201d         \n\nMs. Miller said the group regularly received disturbing handwritten letters, and once had a menacing video posted on its Facebook page by a man who was later convicted of assisting in what he thought was a plot to bomb an abortion clinic.         \n\nOther groups around the nation have also sought to shield their donors from public scrutiny. In recent years, the  \n, which opposes same-sex marriage, has sued in several states to challenge laws requiring the disclosure of donors.         \n\nAnd this spring, the Federal Election Commission agreed to continue exempting the Socialist Workers Party, citing the \u201clong history of threats, violence and harassment\u201d against it.         \n\nBut New York has emerged as a central battleground for efforts to mandate greater disclosure.         \n\nIn addition to the requirement for nonprofit groups to disclose donors to lobbying efforts, the state attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, in June began requiring them to also reveal donations they use to pay for election spending. And last year, the New York City Campaign Finance Board adopted similar rules for independent expenditures in city races.         \n\nThe new lobbying regulations in New York are notable because they apply to groups organized under Section 501(c)(4) of the federal tax code \u2014 groups that have not been required to disclose their donors. Such groups are intended to promote \u201csocial welfare,\u201d but they have become a political force: on the federal level, they reported spending of  \n in the 2012 election cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics in Washington, which tracks political spending.         \n\nIn New York,  \n, too. One group, the  \n, spent more than $13 million on advertising supporting Mr. Cuomo\u2019s agenda in 2011 and 2012; the group went dormant as soon as the state started requiring disclosure of donors.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a period of tremendous evolution right now in these laws about disclosure,\u201d said Kelly Williams, the corporate general counsel for the Brennan Center for Justice, a research and advocacy group at the New York University School of Law.         \n\nMs. Williams said organizations should be exempted from disclosure when there was credible evidence their donors could face threats or harassment, but not when they feared the prospect of economic harm to their donors, \u2014 from a boycott, for example.         \n\nNew York\u2019s  \n goes beyond back-room arm-twisting at the Capitol. It also includes spending on television advertisements that have become a common means for outside groups to rally public support of or opposition against legislation.         \n\nThe new measure requires groups that devote substantial resources to lobbying to disclose all of their donors who contribute  \n.         \n\nMr. Cuomo\u2019s office included in the legislation an exception for lobbying groups whose donors might face \u201charm, threats, harassment, or reprisals,\u201d like civil rights groups.         \n\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, said the exemptions were legally necessary but did not undermine the law.
