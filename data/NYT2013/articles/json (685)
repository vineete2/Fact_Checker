{"headline": "Pain on the Reservation", "body": "\nPINE RIDGE, S.D. \u2014 The Red Cloud-Bissonette family needs a new trailer. Frank, who is disabled, and Norma, his wife, are members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe who live on the sprawling grasslands of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Despite their constant efforts to patch the seams of one of their trailers that was hauled here in 1988, rot and mold continue to climb up the walls.         \n\nThe family has punched a hole in the ceiling for a chimney for their wood stove, a necessity given the harshness of the winters but a fire hazard in the dry climate.         \n\nA second trailer a few feet away, where some family members live, including a grandchild, has no plumbing or running water.         \n\n \nimprovement program that was recently told that it is being shut down. \u201cThese are real, real low-income people,\u201d said Andre Janis, the housing program\u2019s director. \u201cIf we go away, a lot of people are going to be without these services completely.\u201d         \n\nAnd it is just one of dozens of cuts the tribe is stomaching, many of them caused by the mandatory federal budget reductions known as sequestration. When Congress approved legislation for the budget cuts, which went into effect on March 1, they specifically exempted many programs that benefit low-income Americans, including Medicaid, tax credits for working families and food stamps. But virtually none of the programs aiding American Indians \u2014 including money spent through the departments of interior, education, health and human services and agriculture \u2014 were included on that list.         \n\nAs a result, the cuts are starting to deliver yet another blow to hundreds of the United States\u2019 most deeply impoverished communities.         \n\n\u201cMore people sick; fewer people educated; fewer people getting general assistance; more domestic violence; more alcoholism,\u201d said Richard L. Zephier, the executive director of the Oglala Sioux tribe. \u201cThat\u2019s all correlated to the cuts from sequestration.\u201d         \n\nOn the Pine Ridge reservation, home to around 40,000 members of the tribe, the unemployment rate is estimated at as much as 85 percent. Shannon County, home to the town of Pine Ridge, has a per-capita income of less than $8,000. The local economy is not just reliant on transfers from the federal government; it in no small part consists of them.         \n\nOver all, the tribe\u2019s budget is about $80 million a year, of which $70 million comes from federal sources, said Mason Big Crow, the tribe\u2019s treasurer. The tribe still did not know how much money it would lose, waiting on word from Washington, he said, but the number would be in the millions.         \n\nThe tribe is cutting the size of a program that delivers meals to the elderly, many of whom are housebound. The school budget, Head Start program and health service are shrinking, too. The tribe has no choice but to cut everywhere, Mr. Big Crow said.         \n\nDespite the reservation\u2019s extraordinary problems with crime \u2014 alcohol and methamphetamine abuse are rampant, many of the tribe\u2019s youth are involved in gangs \u2014 its police force is absorbing more than a million dollars in cuts.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re cut to the bone,\u201d Ron Duke, the police chief, said. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re being reactive to things. It\u2019s really hard to be proactive when you don\u2019t have enough staff. We\u2019re just constantly answering calls.\u201d         \n\nThe force has already absorbed a cut of more than 6 percent, he said. This autumn, it will cut another 8 percent. Chief Duke has let 14 staff members go. He said that at any given time, the reservation had only nine patrol cars on duty to cover an area the size of Connecticut, exhausting his officers as they chased down calls.         \n\nWith the cuts, the poverty trap that has plagued the reservation for generations looks certain to worsen, with yet more families mired in deprivation, reservation officials and residents said.         \n\n\u201cImagine how people feel who can\u2019t help themselves,\u201d said Robert Brave Heart Sr., the executive vice president of the Red Cloud Indian School on the reservation. \u201cIt\u2019s a condition that a lot of people believe is the result of the federal government putting them in that position, a lot of people are set up for failure. People have no hope and no ability whatsoever to change their fate in life. You take resources that they have, that are taken away, it just adds to the misery.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/13/business/economy/us-budget-cuts-fall-heavily-on-american-indians.html", "date": "2013-07-12", "description": "Legislation specifically exempted many programs that benefit low-income Americans, but virtually none aiding American Indians were included."}
