{"headline": "After Night of Fun and Games, Jets Find Game Is No Fun", "body": "\nORCHARD PARK, N.Y. \u2014 The night before  \n\u2019 first game in two weeks, Coach  \n addressed his players and canceled their offensive and defensive meetings. He had a surprise: a trip to Dave & Buster\u2019s for some arcade fun.         \n\nThe few hours the Jets spent playing Skee-Ball and Pop-A-Shot had no direct effect on the outcome Sunday, a 37-14 loss to Buffalo in the swirling wind at Ralph Wilson Stadium.         \n\nThey lost because expired medicine would have been more effective than Geno Smith, who was pulled, for the second time in three games, after committing four turnovers. They lost because a broken doorknob would have been more useful than their porous pass protection, which yielded four sacks. They lost because Buffalo, which won for the second time in seven games, accepted Ryan\u2019s midweek challenge to throw deep, torching the Jets\u2019 secondary for touchdowns of 43 and 34 yards.         \n\nBut in the wake of this embarrassment, and surely with the benefit of hindsight, it seems as if the Jets\u2019 time Saturday night could have been devoted to a different pursuit \u2014 perhaps remembering to notice Jairus Byrd, who sacked Smith once and picked him off twice, or reviewing their plan to foil E J Manuel, who completed 20 of 28 passes for 245 yards and 2 touchdowns.         \n\nThe Jets allowed 17 points within 2 minutes 50 seconds in the second quarter to fall behind, 20-0, and with their struggles Sunday, they could not change the critics\u2019 perceptions. This entire season has been about appearances, of what kind of team they seem to be, and what seems achievable for them, and how Smith seems worthy of earning long-term job security \u2014 until he seems as if he is not. The Jets (5-5) became the first team in N.F.L. history to alternate wins and losses for its first 10 games. Every week is a mirage, including the last two.         \n\nAll the Jets heard after toppling New Orleans on Nov. 3 was that they were ascending, that a postseason berth seemed less a possibility than part of a natural progression, a reward for their belief and hard work. Neither, now, is true \u2014 or, rather, it does not seem that way.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re running out of time,\u201d said guard Willie Colon, who added that he was weary of answering questions about their playoff chances. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be asked that no more. We\u2019re not going to be a playoff team till they say we\u2019re in the playoffs.\u201d         \n\nThere will not be a declaration, as if read from an unfurled scroll, that the Jets secured a spot. It will happen on the field, their fate decided in a series of games \u2014 against Baltimore and Carolina and Miami twice \u2014 that seemed favorable two weeks ago, a week ago, but now loom as daunting as a four-mile traffic jam.         \n\nWith such small margin for error, the Jets, who are tied with the Dolphins for the A.F.C.\u2019s second wild-card spot but hold the advantage based on a better record in divisional games, must decide how to proceed with Smith over the final six weeks.         \n\nAlready they have scaled back their aggressiveness, adopting a conservative approach \u2014 shorter passes, fewer passes, a heaping helping of Chris Ivory and Bilal Powell \u2014 intended to ease the burden. In the first half Sunday, Smith led an offense that gained 57 yards, completed three passes and recorded three first downs. He was replaced by Matt Simms early in the fourth quarter, after three interceptions and a fumble that might force the Jets to make additional schematic changes. Ryan did say that Smith would start next week in Baltimore.         \n\n\u201cJust bad, man,\u201d said Smith, who has committed 20 turnovers through his first 10 games. \u201cThe way I can sum up this game for myself is awful. I know that I can play better. I know that this isn\u2019t who I am or what I want to be.\u201d         \n\nIt was an earnest answer, but altogether imprecise. This is who Smith is, at least for now. His rookie season includes more performances similar to Sunday\u2019s \u2014 8 for 23 for 103 yards and a 10.1 passer rating \u2014 than his brilliance in Atlanta on Oct. 7. In the five games since, Smith has completed 52.8 percent of his throws with one touchdown pass and eight interceptions. Four have been returned for touchdowns, including the 32-yarder in the third quarter Sunday by Da\u2019Norris Searcy that extended the  \n\u2019 lead to 34-7.         \n\n\u201cI hate using the word growing pains, but that\u2019s exactly what it is for me,\u201d Smith said. \u201cAnd I know the situation we\u2019re in with this team. We can\u2019t have that, so I\u2019ve got to clean that up.\u201d         \n\nSmith has been saying as much for weeks now, much as Ryan and his defense have been saying that the Jets need better coverage. Signing Ed Reed was supposed to help them defend the deep ball, but Reed was not involved in the 34-yard touchdown to T. J. Graham (Dee Milliner) or the 40-yard pass to Graham (Milliner again) or the 43-yard touchdown to Marquise Goodwin (Antonio Cromartie). The Jets allowed 1.8 yards a rush, but their cornerbacks wilted.         \n\nRyan opened his news conference last Thursday by noting that the Jets were underdogs, and he seemed genuinely offended that a team that had yet to win two in a row, that had won once in four away games, would not be favored on the road against a division rival. It was probably not his intent, but Ryan seemed to imply that the Bills were inferior. He deflected the notion that Buffalo could have interpreted the Jets\u2019 outing as a display of disrespect.         \n\n\u201cI was aware of it,\u201d Bills Coach Doug Marrone said. \u201cI did not use it for motivation.\u201d         \n\nMaybe Marrone did not, and in the end, it does not really matter. What should concern Ryan and his players is how they were trounced. No meetings will be canceled Monday. No field trips will be scheduled, either.
