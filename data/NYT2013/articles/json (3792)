{"headline": "Kermit Lynch Knows the Terroir", "body": "\nFor much of the last 35 years, the wine critic Robert Parker dominated the international wine scene. Parker invented the 100-point rating system for wine, and his reviews wielded such influence over sales that vintners everywhere worked to please Parker\u2019s palate, making oaky, intensely flavored, high-alcohol wines. Kermit Lynch, meanwhile, through his wine shop in Berkeley, Calif., and also through his nationwide distribution business, chose to sell only French and Italian wines made in the unadulterated, old-school traditional style aimed at accentuating  \n \u2014 each vineyard\u2019s unique combination of weather, soil and geography.         \n\nFor years, Lynch, who lives in Berkeley and near Bandol,  \n, wrote about these values in a monthly newsletter and also in his 1988 book, \u201cAdventures on the Wine Route: A Wine Buyer\u2019s Tour of France,\u201d which is being reissued by Farrar, Straus & Giroux next month. Today, wine culture is focused on natural and biodynamic wines, and wine bars named Terroir have opened in San Francisco, Scottsdale, Brooklyn, four locations in Manhattan and London. It seems fair to say the Lynch way is finally having its day.         \n\n \nWhat makes you happy when you pick up a restaurant wine list?         \n\n \n I can tell you what makes me unhappy is when it weighs 40 pounds. I just don\u2019t get that. Make the selection for us. But also, when I started bringing in a lot of these wines \u2014 C\u00f4te R\u00f4tie, Chinon \u2014 nobody wanted them. Every restaurant in the States was fighting to get their one annual case of the obvious big-ticket wines like Raveneau or Beaucastel. Now I go into restaurants and I\u2019m asking the sommelier, \u201cWhere\u2019s this from?\u201d It\u2019s a treat. One of the most exciting things happening is sommeliers turning customers on to new wines.         \n\n \nFor the longest time, the Robert Parker way of thinking about wine was ascendant. Now the Kermit Lynch way is in fashion. Why do you think that happened?         \n\n \n There are so many people scoring wines these days. That might dilute Parker\u2019s influence. And he\u2019s hired other writers. I\u2019ve read so many times that Parker\u2019s great secret or invention or whatever \u2014 his route to fame and power \u2014 was that 100-point scoring system. I always thought it was his writing. He\u2019s great at expressing his enthusiasm. You want to feel that way yourself: I want to get all excited! I think too, people are going for more natural wines \u2014 the Parker style and natural wines weren\u2019t a good fit.         \n\n \nWhy?         \n\n \n I call the wines that have been ascendant during the Parker reign \u201cpop wines,\u201d because they\u2019re created by people thinking, Oh, wow, if I make a wine like that I\u2019ll get a hundred points and I\u2019ll be as rich as so-and-so. They see, \u201cJeez, I\u2019m driving my tractor, and he\u2019s driving a Mercedes, and I have land here, too!\u201d But my God, how many oaky alcoholic wines can you suffer before it becomes monotonous?         \n\nI hope that doesn\u2019t come off as harsh \u2014 I don\u2019t criticize Parker for his influence. Parker even denies the existence of the \u201cParker palate,\u201d though he says humorously that his own wife disagrees with him about that. What is important is that he is the only person in the wine world who does not think there is a Parker palate, that there\u2019s a wine style that he has a weakness for.         \n\n \n Wine grapes are being grown all over the world, these days \u2014 is that good or bad?         \n\n \n I don\u2019t stay awake at night about it. Look, there\u2019s great  \n and there\u2019s lousy  \n. A wine showing  \n doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s good.         \n\n \n To what degree does price reflect quality?         \n\n \n I don\u2019t think you can make a blanket statement. One of the two best reds I\u2019ve ever had was a \u201961 Roman\u00e9e-Conti. It was like discovering Bach for the first time, or seeing Michelangelo\u2019s David. Ah! That a grape can do that! I think the new vintages are $1,000 a bottle. Is it worth it? Ask a Russian billionaire. One domaine I imported, Henri Jayer, one of his wines just sold for about $20,000 a bottle. Plenty of wines sell at auction for great sums \u2014 are they worth it? Not always, but every once in a while I wish I were a Russian billionaire.         \n\n \nIs there no reliable difference between, say, a great $100 bottle and a great $1,000 bottle?         \n\n \n Demand, that\u2019s the only difference. Some wines are in, some are out. It\u2019s not quality.         \n\n \n How about grape varietals \u2014 are there any you find particularly interesting right now?         \n\n \nI\u2019m a big fan lately of vermentino. Probably 50 or 60 percent of the bottles I open at home, for my own drinking, are white burgundies or vermentinos. But that changes. It\u2019s like, for a while I\u2019ll just be interested in older wines from my cellar, and then, \u201cOh, no, all I want are young fresh wines.\u201d         \n\n \n Any others?
