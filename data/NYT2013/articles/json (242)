{"headline": "Middling Jobs Numbers\nSignal a Long Path\nto Healthy Payrolls", "body": "\nHiring in the United States is inching up \u2014 but not quickly enough to put much of a dent in the backlog of nearly 12 million unemployed workers left stranded by the recession and its aftermath.         \n\nAmerican employers added 175,000 jobs in May, almost exactly the average monthly job growth over the last year, the Labor Department reported Friday, and wages remained basically flat. Economists were relieved that  \n were not worse, given a string of other disappointing data in recent weeks, but noted that current job trends still left the economy far short of what it is capable of if Americans were more fully employed.         \n\nAt the current pace of job and labor force growth, it would take  \n to get the economy back to the low unemployment rate it had when the recession officially began in December 2007.         \n\n\u201cI feel hopeless, and that just makes it hard,\u201d said Sherry Lockhart, 53, of Enumclaw, Wash., who was laid off by the state\u2019s liquor control board a year ago, when voters privatized liquor sales. Now, her jobless benefits are about to be slashed as a result of federal spending cuts. \u201cI just feel I\u2019ve done my best over the years, and I feel like I haven\u2019t failed the system. The system has failed me, and millions more.\u201d         \n\nBy contrast, Wall Street was pleased with the latest report because the steady but modest gains suggest that the  \n tightening monetary policy anytime soon, as some had feared would be the case if the job market suddenly started showing major improvement. The Dow Jones industrial average and the broader Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index each closed up for the day by more than 1 percent.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a decent report, but it\u2019s not by any means robust,\u201d said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economist at RDQ Economics, a research firm. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not strong enough to get the Fed to make any significant changes at its meeting in June.\u201d         \n\nThe unemployment rate rose to 7.6 percent from 7.5 percent in April. The cause behind the uptick in the unemployment rate, at least, was also mildly encouraging: more people joined the labor force, perhaps indicating that Americans who have been sitting on the sidelines believe that they finally have a chance to find a job. This labor force participation rate is still low by historical standards, however.         \n\nConsumers have also been relatively upbeat recently. A  \n conducted May 31 to June 4 found that 39 percent of respondents believe the condition of the economy is very or fairly good, the highest share saying this both since President Obama took office and since the recession began in December 2007.         \n\nDespite signs of optimism from consumers and investors, other indicators of the health of the economy and the job market have been mixed. Average weekly hours and average hourly earnings, for example, have shown little improvement in recent months, according to the Labor Department. Wages are up just 2 percent from a year earlier, which leaves most Americans treading water, barely outpacing the rate of inflation.         \n\n\u201cThe wage gains are very disconcerting, and particularly strange when you see these surveys of employers who say they have positions they can\u2019t fill,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201cThat means they should be bidding up wages.\u201d         \n\nWage growth may be held back by the composition of jobs being created, he said, as there are many jobs being added in low-paying sectors like retail. Restaurants and bars, for example, have added 337,000 jobs over the last year; that category now makes up about 7.6 percent of all payroll jobs, its largest share on record.         \n\nThe other big industry to add jobs in May was professional and business services, particularly temporary help services. Temp services employment has been growing for six consecutive months, and as of May, about 2 percent of all American jobs were in the sector.         \n\nThe federal government, on the other hand, lost 14,000 jobs in May, partly because of the across-the-board spending cuts, known as the sequestration, enacted by Congress in March.         \n\n\u201cWith the recovery gaining traction, now is not the time for Washington to impose self-inflicted wounds on the economy,\u201d Alan B. Krueger, President Obama\u2019s chief economic adviser, said  \n. \u201cThe administration continues to urge Congress to replace the sequester with balanced deficit reduction, while working to put in place measures to create middle-class jobs, such as by rebuilding our roads and bridges and promoting American manufacturing.\u201d         \n\nOver the last three months, the federal government has lost 45,000 jobs, not including the furloughs that many federal employees are being placed on. The Pentagon, for example,  \n that it plans to furlough 680,000 civilian workers starting in early July, with most workers losing about one paid day a week.
