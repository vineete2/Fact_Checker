{"headline": "Money Talk Before Marriage a Tip You Can\u2019t Disparage", "body": "\nWHEN Joe, 64, a computer professional in Massachusetts, married for the first time, he was 31 and very in love.         \n\n\u201cShe was attracted to me because I had structure; I was attracted to her because she was a lot of fun,\u201d said Joe.         \n\nHe had noticed some financial red flags while they were dating: She always carried a credit card balance and liked buying expensive gifts for people. Still, he said, he wasn\u2019t fazed: \u201cI never thought about it, because it wasn\u2019t my problem.\u201d         \n\nAfter they married, though, his new wife\u2019s spending habits became Joe\u2019s problem.         \n\n\u201cShe could drain a checking account in no time,\u201d he recalled. Joe describes himself as an avid saver, and his and his wife\u2019s financial differences became the cause of bad fights. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stand being broke all the time and really struggling to pay the bills, and she didn\u2019t like the restriction of me saying we can\u2019t afford this,\u201d he said. \u2018We kind of drove each other into corners. She became more irresponsible and I became more rigid.\u201d Joe and his wife divorced after three years, largely because of financial differences.         \n\nResearch shows that money is the No. 1 reason couples fight and a main reason marriages split up. Yet most couples do not talk about money before they marry, said Terri Orbuch of the University of Michigan\u2019s Institute for Social Research. Dr. Orbuch has been tracking 373 married couples for more than 26 years. \u201cIn our society, money is a really taboo subject, almost like sex,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact, I think money is even more taboo, because these days friends talk about sex, but we don\u2019t usually know how much our friends make.\u201d         \n\nAs a result, said Dr. Orbuch, we tend to avoid the issue until a problem comes up and, although marriage is one of the most important financial decisions many people will ever make, most go into it blind.         \n\nLair Torrent, a family and couples therapist based in New York, said his single clients often seemed ashamed to bring up financial concerns about the people they dated. \u201cOur popular culture puts it out there that it should be all puppy dogs and ice cream, and there\u2019s this sheepishness about bringing up the money issue,\u201d he said.         \n\nChristine, 39, a lawyer in Alabama, did not broach the subject when her boyfriend of four years proposed. \u201cIn retrospect, if we\u2019d go out for a nice dinner, I somehow always ended up paying, but I honestly never thought about it,\u201d she said. \u201cHe swept me off my feet.\u201d         \n\nAs soon as the couple moved in together and joined their bank accounts, it quickly became clear that money was going to be a problem. Christine\u2019s fianc\u00e9 was out of work, but he wouldn\u2019t stop spending. \u201cHe would rack up overdraft fees and started dipping into my savings,\u201d she said.         \n\nWhen business slowed at her practice, the situation became dire. \u201cThings got really bad, really scary,\u201d she recalled. Christine ended up cashing out her  \n to cover their bills. \u201cWhen I told him, \u2018I can\u2019t believe I did this. You just don\u2019t cash in your  \n,\u2019 he said, \u2018Why are you trying to make me feel guilty?\u2019 His attitude was, \u2018If you have money, you use it.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nDanielle, 26, a store manager in New York State, said she also ignored red flags when she began dating her boyfriend. \u201cHe would always get calls from his sister and they would argue about money, but I didn\u2019t think much of it,\u201d she said. It turned out that Danielle\u2019s boyfriend had lost his job, was living in a foreclosed home and was so behind on car payments, his car was in danger of repossession.         \n\nDanielle began tapping her credit to cover his car payments and the cost of a  \n lawyer. She bought him suits for job interviews. \u201cI\u2019m almost $20,000 in debt because of all that,\u201d she said.         \n\nIn spite of those troubles, Danielle moved in with her boyfriend and was ready to marry him. \u201cI just kept thinking, \u2018He\u2019s made these mistakes in the past, but I\u2019m here now, I can fix it,\u2019 \u00a0\u201d she said. \u201c\u00a0\u2019We\u2019re building a future together.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nIn spite of the enormous role money plays in marriage, Mr. Torrent said financial concerns rarely seemed to stand in the way of marriage or commitment. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about this being a deal-breaker, but I don\u2019t ever see it,\u201d he said.
