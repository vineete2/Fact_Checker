{"headline": "Vote for Merkel Seen as Victory for Austerity", "body": "\nBRUSSELS \u2014 As Angela Merkel savored the results of Germany\u2019s national elections, newspapers on the left and right in Greece on Monday gave the same mournful assessment of what the result means beyond German borders. \u201cVictory for the Queen of Austerity,\u201d declared the front page of  \n, a center-left daily. \u201cMerkel victory atop the ruins of the South,\u201d said the conservative  \n.         \n\nBloggers, meanwhile, posted a cartoon that showed Ms. Merkel, a stethoscope around her neck, wagging her finger at a skeleton slumped in a blue chair and ordering, \u201cExercise, exercise, exercise to strengthen your muscles.\u201d         \n\nFor months now, Europe has been waiting for the end of a German election campaign that, while focused almost entirely on domestic issues, stirred furtive hope among those outside Germany that, if re-elected to a third term, Ms. Merkel, despite having given no indication, would try a more energetic, and perhaps more economically stimulative, approach to leading Europe out of its extended slump. The waiting has now ended \u2014 and so, too, has any hint of a new approach.         \n\nInstead of a respite from years of grinding budget cuts and tax increases in return for bailout funds, Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservative Christian Democrats campaigned on holding the line against expensive commitments to reviving Germany\u2019s neighbors. Her financial aides claimed that signs that Europe\u2019s long recession had recently become less severe had proved that its austerity policies were working.         \n\nMs. Merkel\u2019s electoral success \u2014 the Christian Democrats and their allies, the Christian Social Union in Bavaria, together won 41.5 percent of the popular vote \u2014 will bring \u201cmore of the same,\u201d predicted Mats Persson, director of  \n a London-based research group. For countries now on economic life support, this would mean yet more painful \u201cexercise,\u201d which in Greece has slimmed job prospects so significantly that over 60 percent of youth are now unemployed.         \n\nWhatever coalition government emerges in Berlin from what could be weeks of haggling, Mr. Persson said, \u201cthere may be a little change of rhetoric, but the substance will remain the same.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThere will be a continued focus on austerity,\u201d he said.         \n\nMs. Merkel said as much herself during a final day of campaigning on Saturday. \u201cWe have to continue on this course,\u201d she told a rally in Berlin, denouncing the European policies of her main rival, Peer Steinbr\u00fcck, who had called for a presumably mostly German-financed Marshall Plan to relieve what he called \u201ca deadly dose of austerity.\u201d         \n\nStill, some outside Germany held out hope that a coalition with Mr. Steinbr\u00fcck and his Social Democrats could moderate Ms. Merkel\u2019s approach.         \n\n\u201cWe should not forget that Merkel needs a partner,\u201d said Hannes Swoboda of Austria, president of the Socialists and Democrats, a grouping of left-leaning forces in the European Parliament in Brussels. \u201cNow is the time to get a more flexible policy. She could not be flexible before the election for fear of losing votes to the Alternative for Germany,\u201d he said. He was referring to an upstart protest party that, campaigning on promises to scrap the euro and stop using German money to bail out Europe\u2019s economic laggards, nearly crossed the 5 percent hurdle to enter Parliament.         \n\nMs. Merkel\u2019s center-left opponents tried during the campaign to rally support for the idea of so-called eurobonds, which would effectively pool the debts of the 17 countries that use the euro. But even Mr. Swoboda says the new flexibility he expects from Ms. Merkel will not go that far. \u201cThis is not on the agenda,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe in three or four years.\u201d         \n\nThe idea of pooling obligations was raised at the start of Europe\u2019s rolling debt crisis in 2009 and gained support among some economists. But, in a measure of Germany\u2019s outsize role in decision-making in Brussels, it went nowhere once Ms. Merkel made clear that she opposed it.         \n\nAsked about the possibility of Greece\u2019s receiving more funds, Ms. Merkel said on German television immediately after Sunday\u2019s election that her finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, was already committed to examining a further request, and that would almost certainly lead to a third bailout deal for Athens. Mr. Sch\u00e4uble also appeared on television Sunday night, assuring Germany\u2019s European partners that Berlin would play a \u201creliable\u201d role in the Continent\u2019s affairs.         \n\nFor much of Europe, particularly in countries that balk at what they see as efforts by Berlin to recreate European economies in its own image, Ms. Merkel inspires a mix of anxiety and grudging respect. Italy\u2019s  \n newspaper on Monday called her the \u201ctranquil and fierce czarina that bewitched Germany.\u201d The French newspaper \ndeclared her \u201cChancellor of Germany, Chief of Europe.\u201d         \n\nWith nearly a third of the euro zone\u2019s economic output and the lowest unemployment rate after Austria \u2014 5.3 percent in July compared with 27.6 percent in Greece and 26.3 in Spain, according to Eurostat, Europe\u2019s statistical agency \u2014 Germany is Europe\u2019s undisputed economic powerhouse, and also its paymaster.         \n\nBut having already contributed hundreds of billions of dollars to bailout funds for Greece, Ireland and others, Berlin is in no mood to relax its insistence that countries asking for help must undertake labor market and other reforms and accept the tough discipline of \u201cfiscal consolidation,\u201d economist-speak for austerity.  \n, an economic research institute in Munich, estimates that Germany has paid out nearly $600 billion, and has total bailout liabilities of $868 billion.
