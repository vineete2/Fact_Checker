{"headline": "A Federal Budget Crisis Months in the Planning", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Shortly after President Obama started his second term, a loose-knit coalition of conservative activists led by former Attorney General Edwin Meese III gathered in the capital to plot strategy. Their push to repeal Mr. Obama\u2019s  \n was going nowhere, and they desperately needed a new plan.         \n\nOut of that session, held one morning in a location the members insist on keeping secret, came a little-noticed \u201c \n,\u201d signed by Mr. Meese and leaders of more than three dozen conservative groups.         \n\nIt articulated a take-no-prisoners legislative strategy that had long percolated in conservative circles: that Republicans could derail the health care overhaul if conservative lawmakers were willing to push fellow Republicans \u2014 including their cautious leaders \u2014 into cutting off financing for the entire federal government.         \n\n\u201cWe felt very strongly at the start of this year that the House needed to use the power of the purse,\u201d said one coalition member, Michael A. Needham, who runs Heritage Action for America, the political arm of the Heritage Foundation. \u201cAt least at Heritage Action, we felt very strongly from the start that this was a fight that we were going to pick.\u201d         \n\nLast week the country witnessed the fallout from that strategy: a standoff that has shuttered much of the federal bureaucracy and unsettled the nation.         \n\nTo many Americans, the shutdown came out of nowhere. But interviews with a wide array of conservatives show that the confrontation that precipitated the crisis was the outgrowth of a long-running effort to undo the law, the Affordable Care Act, since its passage in 2010 \u2014 waged by a galaxy of conservative groups with more money, organized tactics and interconnections than is commonly known.         \n\nWith polls showing Americans deeply divided over the law, conservatives believe that the public is behind them. Although the law\u2019s opponents say that shutting down the government was not their objective, the activists anticipated that a shutdown could occur \u2014 and worked with members of the  \n caucus in Congress who were excited about drawing a red line against a law they despise.         \n\nA defunding \u201c \n\u201d created in early September included talking points for the question, \u201cWhat happens when you shut down the government and you are blamed for it?\u201d The suggested answer was the one House Republicans give today: \u201cWe are simply calling to fund the entire government except for the Affordable Care Act/Obamacare.\u201d         \n\nThe current budget brinkmanship is just the latest development in a well-financed, broad-based assault on the health law, Mr. Obama\u2019s signature legislative initiative. Groups like Tea Party Patriots, Americans for Prosperity and FreedomWorks are all immersed in the fight, as is Club for Growth, a business-backed nonprofit organization. Some, like Generation Opportunity and Young Americans for Liberty, both aimed at young adults, are upstarts. Heritage Action is new, too, founded in 2010 to advance the policy prescriptions of its sister group, the Heritage Foundation.         \n\nThe billionaire Koch brothers, Charles and David, have been deeply involved with financing the overall effort. A group linked to the Kochs, Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, disbursed more than $200 million last year to nonprofit organizations involved in the fight. Included was $5 million to Generation Opportunity, which created a buzz last month with an Internet advertisement showing a menacing Uncle Sam figure popping up between a woman\u2019s legs during a gynecological exam.         \n\nThe groups have also sought to pressure vulnerable Republican members of Congress with scorecards keeping track of their health care votes; have  \n \u201cObamacare cards\u201d on college campuses; and have distributed scripts for phone calls to Congressional offices, sample letters to editors and Twitter and Facebook offerings for followers to present as their own.         \n\nOne sample Twitter offering \u2014 \u201cObamacare is a train wreck\u201d \u2014 is a common refrain for Speaker John A. Boehner.         \n\nAs the defunding movement picked up steam among outside advocates, Republicans who sounded tepid became targets. The  \n, a political action committee dedicated to \u201celecting true conservatives,\u201d ran radio advertisements against three Republican incumbents.         \n\nHeritage Action ran critical Internet advertisements in the districts of 100 Republican lawmakers who had failed to sign a letter by a North Carolina freshman, Representative Mark Meadows, urging Mr. Boehner to take up the defunding cause.         \n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been hugely influential,\u201d said David Wasserman, who tracks House races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. \u201cWhen else in our history has a freshman member of Congress from North Carolina been able to round up a gang of 80 that\u2019s essentially ground the government to a halt?\u201d         \n\nOn Capitol Hill, the advocates found willing partners in Tea Party conservatives, who have repeatedly threatened to shut down the government if they do not get their way on spending issues. This time they said they were so alarmed by the health law that they were willing to risk a shutdown over it. (\u201cThis is exactly what the public wants,\u201d Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, founder of the House Tea Party Caucus, said on the eve of the shutdown.)
