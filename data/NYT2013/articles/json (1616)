{"headline": "A Team Is Born, but Not All Cheer", "body": "\nA few days before Thanksgiving, as the city still reeled from Hurricane Sandy, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg convened a meeting at Gracie Mansion to jump-start talks for a project he considered part of his legacy to the city, a new soccer stadium in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens.         \n\nExecutives from Major League Soccer were joined by investors from the United Arab Emirates, the owners of the Manchester City Football Club, who were willing to build the stadium for a new American soccer team they hoped to buy. They were at odds with another group in the room: Jeff Wilpon and his cousin Scott, who represented the Mets and who were demanding more than $40 million from the Abu Dhabi investors as compensation for allowing soccer fans to park at nearby Citi Field.         \n\nThe mayor entered the room and, to break the tension, joked that he would visit the park if there were a golf course there rather than a soccer stadium. Then he cut to the chase: The stadium \u201cwould be good for the city,\u201d he said, according to people at the meeting.         \n\n\u201cReasonable people can work this out,\u201d Bloomberg added before leaving the room minutes after arriving.         \n\nAlmost six months later, the Mets and soccer officials have still not come to terms, and the stadium issue remains intensely disputed among elected officials, youth soccer leaders and parks advocates. But the Manchester City owners \u2014 an investment group led by Sheik Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, a member of the royal family of Abu Dhabi \u2014 forged ahead anyway, announcing Tuesday that it would buy an M.L.S. team for an estimated $100 million with an unexpected partner, the Mets\u2019 crosstown rivals.         \n\nThose rivals, the Yankees, will be a part-owner of the New York City Football Club, a new team that is expected to begin competing in M.L.S. in 2015 but has no home to move into.         \n\nThe Manchester City-Yankees partnership, which will no doubt antagonize the Mets, will deepen existing ties because the Yankees\u2019 stadium concessions business, Legends Hospitality, already provides services at Manchester City\u2019s home ground, Etihad Stadium. Manchester City, the recently deposed champion of England\u2019s Premier League, will play an exhibition match against another British powerhouse, Chelsea, on Saturday at Yankee Stadium, and city and M.L.S. officials were eager to announce a deal before that game.         \n\n\u201cIn the Yankees, we have found the absolute best partner for developing a world-class sports organization and a winning team that will carry the New York City Football Club name with pride,\u201d said Ferran Soriano, the chief executive of Manchester City.         \n\nWhile initially willing to buy the team on its own, Manchester City decided in the last week to team with the Yankees. In doing so, it gained a wealthy local partner well acquainted with building a stadium and navigating New York\u2019s often treacherous political and regulatory shoals. Manchester City\u2019s owners are also hoping that a partnership with the Yankees will shield them from criticism that a stadium project in the park represents a sweetheart deal for Arab royalty, according to team executives.         \n\nBy joining with one of the top teams in the Premier League, the Yankees \u2014 who are investing as much as $25 million in the new M.L.S. team \u2014 also hope to turn Yankee Stadium into a marquee destination for high-profile soccer matches.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing business here a long time and we know how things work,\u201d said Randy Levine, the president of the Yankees, who said the team\u2019s cable network, YES, could broadcast New York City F.C.\u2019s games. \u201cWe\u2019ll have their back throughout all of this.\u201d         \n\nMets officials declined to comment on the deal.         \n\nThe agreement represents the culmination of two years of negotiations involving conflicting interests that included the mayor, city agencies, the Abu Dhabi investment group, M.L.S., parks and community advocates, soccer fans, the Mets and the United States Tennis Association, among others. In addition to paying for the proposed stadium in Queens, the sheik\u2019s investment group would spend about $90 million to replace lost parkland and soccer fields, and on other measures.
