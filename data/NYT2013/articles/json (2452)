{"headline": "Dufner Holds Steady and Takes Trophy", "body": "\nPITTSFORD, N.Y. \u2014 The former titleholder was standing behind the 18th green, waiting to greet Jason Dufner, the latest P.G.A. Championship winner. It was not Rory McIlroy, who won last year and finished tied for eighth in his defense.         \n\nKeegan Bradley, who won the 2011 event at Dufner\u2019s expense, returned to Oak Hill Country Club from his hotel, where he watched most of Dufner\u2019s two-stroke victory over Jim Furyk while taking to Twitter to provide insider analysis like \u201cThe duff daddy is dialed in.\u201d         \n\nBradley will not have  \n to needle anymore about not having a replica of the Wanamaker Trophy. Dufner, who began the day one stroke behind Furyk, birdied three of the first eight holes to take a lead that a bogey-bogey finish could not blemish. He closed with a two-under 68 for a 10-under 270. Furyk, trying to win his first major title since the 2003 United States Open, carded a 71 that also included a bogey-bogey finish.         \n\nHenrik Stenson, who was bidding to become the first Swede to win a men\u2019s major, posted a 70 and finished third, three shots back. It was Stenson\u2019s lowest finish in a month, after seconds at the British Open and the World Golf Championships event in Ohio. As he left the 18th green, Stenson pointed at the Wanamaker Trophy and said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you next year.\u201d         \n\nDufner, 36, seemed surprised to see Bradley, wearing basketball shorts and a T-shirt, in the hovering throng of people as he stood over a short bogey putt to seal the win. When it dropped, Dufner celebrated with two fist pumps that could have been mistaken for involuntary twitches. After he hugged his wife, Amanda, Dufner received a bear hug from Bradley, who told him he was proud of him.         \n\n\u201cThat friendship is just really cool,\u201d Dufner\u2019s wife said. \u201cThe way that all came about is really special.\u201d         \n\nHow the two fierce competitors became fast friends reveals more about Dufner\u2019s personality than he will ever show in public. It was forged in the most awkward of arenas, during the playoff between the two at the 2011 P.G.A. Championship at the Atlanta Athletic Club.         \n\nEach was gunning for his first major victory. Dufner, a 54-hole co-leader, fell into the three-hole playoff with three late bogeys. In the extra time, Dufner shot one stroke higher than Bradley, who has not let him forget it.         \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good guy and he\u2019s good-hearted about a little ribbing that I give him about that day,\u201d Bradley said.         \n\nNow that Dufner has his name on the winner\u2019s trophy, Bradley will have to find something else to give him grief about. One senses that Bradley, 27, is more than up to the challenge.         \n\n\u201cHe always jabbed at me a little bit about having one of these in his house,\u201d Dufner said, referring to the trophy, \u201cand thanks for giving it to him and all that stuff. And now I\u2019ve got one, too. It\u2019s pretty neat to come back and win a P.G.A., to be honest.\u201d         \n\nBradley played his final round nearly four hours before Furyk and Dufner, with so much ground to make up that if Oak Hill had been a marathon course, Bradley would not have had the leaders in his sights.         \n\nThat did not stop Bradley from giving chase. His goal, he said later, was to better the pace set by Dufner on Friday when he posted a course-record 63.         \n\n\u201cI wanted to beat Duf\u2019s course record, for sure,\u201d said Bradley, who seemed poised to succeed when he birdied 6 of the first 13 holes to surge into a group behind the lead pack at three under for the tournament.         \n\nOn the 14th hole, Bradley hit a bark wall. His drive caromed off a tree, and he left the green with his first bogey of the day. He made another bogey at the last hole to card a 66 and sew up a tie for 19th.         \n\nAfter signing his scorecard, Bradley said he was looking forward to seeing what kind of finishing kick Furyk and Dufner were able to muster. \u201cI think they are both super intense,\u201d he said. \u201cOn Sundays, they wouldn\u2019t be your first choice to go up against.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/12/sports/golf/live-updates-final-round-of-the-pga-championship.html", "date": "2013-08-11", "description": "Jason Dufner, who lost the 2011 P.G.A.
