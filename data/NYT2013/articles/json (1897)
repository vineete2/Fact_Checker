{"headline": "One Song (\u2018Royals\u2019). Six Takes.", "body": "\n \n         \n\nI\u2019m deviating this week. The original song we\u2019re covering is not old, it\u2019s quite new. Don\u2019t worry: even if you\u2019re not up on new music, between your children, grandchildren, satellite and commercial radio, you have heard the song \u201cRoyals\u201d by the 16-year-old New Zealander \n(it was released in June and reached No. 1 on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 List). But I bet your kids don\u2019t know that the song (a  \n about the gap between pop-culture fantasies of diamonds and most peoples\u2019 reality, wrote Jon Pareles of The New York Times) has already been covered by some of their favorite artists. I\u2019ve included some below. The original is pure pop, but Pentatonix composed it a cappella, Mayer Hawthorne funked it up, Walk Off the Earth choreographed theirs, Kina Grannis ( Fresh Big Mouf) added a touch of tech and Paper Route did a rock rendition. Which version gets your vote?         \nLorde - Royals (US Version) \n[Official Video] Royals - Pentatonix (Lorde Cover) \nRoyals Walk off the Earth Video \nRoyals - Lorde Cover (Kina Grannis ft.
