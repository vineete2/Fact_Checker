{"headline": "Insurance Rolls to Rise in State Fighting Plan", "body": "\nFLORENCE, S.C. \u2014 Brenda B. Culick has two  \n in her heart and a severe wound in her right leg, injured while she was doing home repairs six months ago. But she cannot afford to see a cardiologist or go to a wound care center.         \n\nHer household income is $1,200 a month, but she does not qualify for Medicaid because she has no dependent children and is not disabled. Ms. Culick, 52, is one of several hundred thousand people left behind by South Carolina\u2019s refusal to expand Medicaid under President Obama\u2019s health care law \u2014 a choice made by about half the states.         \n\n\u201cIf I could get Medicaid, I\u2019d be the happiest person on earth,\u201d Ms. Culick said.         \n\nIn her State of the State speech in January, Gov.  \n, a Republican, said, \u201cSouth Carolina will not implement the public policy disaster that is Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\u201d And she boasted of her stance at a recent rally announcing her bid for re-election. \u201cWhen it came to Obamacare,\u201d she said, \u201cwe didn\u2019t just say \u2018no,\u2019 we said \u2018never.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nThe reality, however, is more complex. South Carolina officials say they welcome the prospect that more than a half-million state residents \u2014 out of a population of 4.7 million \u2014 could soon gain access to affordable coverage, even without the expansion of Medicaid eligibility. And they are working to remake Medicaid so that it does not just pay claims but produces measurable improvements in the health of poor people.         \n\nEven without a change in eligibility rules, enrollment is expected to grow as a result of the new health care law. The law requires most Americans to have coverage, and state officials predict that the mandate will prompt more of those who are currently eligible, but not enrolled, to sign up for Medicaid. Consumers will see many advertisements from the Obama administration and insurers urging them to obtain coverage, and that is also expected to drive Medicaid enrollment.         \n\n\u201cIf they are eligible for Medicaid, they should get it,\u201d said Dr. William R. Jennings Jr., a medical director at the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services. \u201cIf people are eligible for coverage in the exchange, they should get it.\u201d         \n\nMr. Obama\u2019s health care law was intended to provide coverage in two major ways: by expanding Medicaid eligibility and by setting up an insurance marketplace, or exchange, where people can shop for private insurance.         \n\nMs. Haley and the Republican-controlled Legislature here did neither. But state officials say they recognize that low- and moderate-income residents will get insurance subsidized by the federal government, in a marketplace run by federal officials.         \n\nEnrollment in the exchange begins Oct. 1, for coverage starting Jan. 1, but many who apply are likely to be found eligible for Medicaid. State officials are bracing for the impact of the changes, the biggest in decades.         \n\nThe call center of the state Medicaid program is doubling its staff to answer a flood of calls and questions about the federal law, the Affordable Care Act. It is running a \u201c \n boot camp\u201d to train new employees. And officials are rewiring computers to connect the state Medicaid program to the federal exchange.         \n\nState officials say that people who are uninsured \u2014 more than one-sixth of South Carolina residents \u2014 should get any coverage to which they are entitled.         \n\nAs a condition of receiving their full allotment of Medicaid money, hospitals in South Carolina will be required to check uninsured patients to see if they might qualify for the existing Medicaid program, for subsidized insurance on the federal exchange or for other coverage.         \n\nAnthony E. Keck, who as director of the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services is also the state\u2019s Medicaid director, said: \u201cOur goal is not to insure as many people as Obamacare. Our mission is to purchase the most health for our citizens in need, at the least possible cost to the taxpayer.\u201d         \n\nState officials predict that 430,000 people could get insurance through the federal exchange in South Carolina. And they say that 170,000 people who are already eligible, but not enrolled, may sign up for Medicaid.         \n\n\u201cWe will actively go after that population,\u201d Mr. Keck said.
