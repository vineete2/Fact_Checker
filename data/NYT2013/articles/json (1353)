{"headline": "Kings Point, a Magic Kingdom for the Retirement Set", "body": "\nI loved my mom very much, but never looked forward to visiting her at Kings Point, a huge, gated retirement community in Delray Beach, Fla.         \n\nFor several winters, in the 1980s and \u201890s, Mom and her sister Celia would rent a condo there.  \n, these places were the Levittowns of retirement life, thousands of condos in identical low-rise town houses offering comfortable living at affordable prices. They were filled mainly with people like Mom \u2014 middle-class and blue-collar Jews from the Northeast.         \n\nIt always struck me as paradoxical. Mom\u2019s generation of Jews had fled the European ghettos where they had been forced to wear yellow stars on their chests and were brutally herded into segregated, walled communities. Some had survived the concentration camps. And here they were in America, spending their winters in walled-off communities segregated by religion and age.         \n\nThe difference of course, was free will \u2014 people didn\u2019t choose to live in the Warsaw ghetto.         \n\nThey paid to live in Kings Point and Century Village and were happy about it.         \n\nPart of the reason they were happy was the price. I don\u2019t remember what Mom spent for her three months, but I know the rent wasn\u2019t more than several hundred dollars a month. When these places began opening in the 1970s \u2014 there are four Century Villages \u2014 some of the townhouses sold for under $20,000.         \n\nAnd the amenities, oh the amenities. It was like living in a Disneyland for the old. There was golf, shuffleboard, swimming in one of the too many pools to count, sauna, lectures, water aerobics, workout rooms. There was nightly entertainment \u2014 singers, dancers, musicians, magicians, jugglers \u2014 vaudeville resurrected in theaters as big and well-kept as the ones on Broadway. I once wrote a story for The Miami Herald about the comedians who played the South Florida retirement circuit \u2014 condo comics.         \n\nSari Gilman, a filmmaker, has captured the good and the bad of this life in her moving documentary, \u201c \n,\u201d which was nominated for an Oscar and makes its television debut Monday night on HBO.         \n\nI recommend it, though the film is not always easy to watch. Retirement communities all have the same unhappy ending: death.         \n\nMs. Gilman follows five seniors who had moved from New York. By the time she arrived with her camera, many had been there for two or three decades.         \n\nThey are battling aging and all the bad things that go with it \u2014 physical problems, emotional problems, loneliness. There is an underlying sadness to the film, made sadder by a forced gaiety.         \n\nNone of this is unique to Kings Point, it\u2019s just more in your face there since everyone is going through it at the same time.         \n\nOne of the toughest things for my mother as she aged was watching her friends and relatives die off. That was a matter of life, not geography.         \n\nThere is another way to look at all this. Ms. Gilman came to know Kings Point from visiting her grandparents there. Her grandmother was a bank teller, her grandfather a salesman.         \n\nMy mother was a school secretary, my Aunt Celia a bookkeeper for a furniture company.         \n\nKings Point gave them a way to winter in Florida without being rich. The cost wasn\u2019t much more than their monthly Social Security checks.         \n\nWill the next generation of retirees follow them to Kings Point? While it\u2019s too early to know, as our news story points out, there are indications they may for the same reasons \u2014 decent housing in the warm South Florida sun at a modest price, and all those amenities.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/10/booming/kings-point-a-magic-kingdom-for-the-retirement-set.html", "date": "2013-03-09", "description": "An HBO documentary captures the good and the bad of life in a Florida community \u2014 a life my mother saw up close."}
