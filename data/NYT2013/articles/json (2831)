{"headline": "Call It Amphibious Cooking", "body": "\nSELDOM DOES A RECIPE say it doesn\u2019t matter whether you use meat or fish. But sometimes, it\u2019s true. Grilled swordfish, for instance, tastes good with a savory wild mushroom sauce of the sort you might make for a pork roast.         \n\nAnd a garlicky olive-oil-based saut\u00e9 with lemon, capers and parsley works equally well with sea scallops as with sweetbreads, or chicken, or shrimp. Broiled mustard-smeared mackerel, or lamb chops done the same way?         \n\nIn a Barcelona restaurant, I once had a marvelous cuttlefish stew, prepared like a meat braise with peas, carrots and brown gravy. It seemed new wave, but turned out to be a traditional regional specialty.         \n\nOf course you can\u2019t make this kind of substitution across the board. Tender mild fish, like sole or flounder, need little more than butter and lemon to accent their delicacy and sweetness. It is the meatier fish, like tuna, sea bass, monkfish or mahi-mahi, that can handle bolder flavors and more aggressive seasoning.         \n\nWhen I\u2019m cooking tuna, I treat it like beefsteak: showered with crushed black peppercorns and pan seared. I used to put tuna au poivre on the menu from time to time when I was cooking at Chez Panisse. It was fun to carry the similarity further, cutting the fish in the shape of a thick filet mignon and serving it with a red-wine sauce and a spoonful of mashed potatoes or a pile of pommes frites and a bunch of watercress.         \n\nIt looks elegant and it\u2019s easy to make. If your dinner guests do a double-take, you can tell them it may remind them of meat, but it\u2019s fish.
