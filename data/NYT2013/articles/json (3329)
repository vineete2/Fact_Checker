{"headline": "Europe, in 9 Walks", "body": "\n \n         \n\nBerlin may not be defined by its waterways \u2014 like, say, Amsterdam or Venice \u2014 but they are among the city\u2019s most endearing characteristics. On a spring day, there are few better walking routes than the stretch of the Landwehrkanal that runs through the Kreuzberg quarter and the rapidly gentrifying immigrant district of Neuk\u00f6lln. Built in 1850, the Landwehrkanal was once used as a drainage system and to transport goods. Today, it\u2019s used mainly by tourist boats and other watercraft, many bearing anti-capitalist flags or rigged with bass-heavy sound systems.         \n\nStart at the Lohm\u00fchlenbr\u00fccke, where the canal forks out to the River Spree. The former East Berlin district of Treptow starts just on the other side (the bridge used to come to an end at the Berlin Wall). Follow the weeping-willow-lined canal westward. If it\u2019s Sunday, ironically attired residents can be found selling hand-drawn comic strips and vintage costume jewelry at the canalside  \n. On Tuesdays and Fridays, the lively older  \n unfolds a bit farther down. Produce, baked goods, spices, fabrics and other wares represent the Turkish-Kurdish-Arab community that has historically resided here. In the barking cadences of a seller at an Istanbul bazaar, Turkish men in tracksuits belt out the price of tomatoes \u2014 in German.         \n\nCross Kottbusser Damm and follow the canal past the startlingly grand, curved facades of the Jugendstil residences that stare across the water at the remaining wing of the neo-Classical-style  \n, which was desecrated by the Nazis but once again houses an active congregation. Continue on to the Admiralbr\u00fccke, a wrought-iron Art Nouveau bridge; depending on your level of tolerance or inebriation, join the backpackers and others drinking beer and listening to Spanish street musicians play bad Oasis covers. Finally, venture on until you reach the grassy banks of the Planufer where residents picnic and read as boats slide by. \u2014 CHARLY WILDER \n         \n\n \n         \n\nTurkey is a majority Muslim country, but Istanbul\u2019s religious history remains multicultural. Evidence of this is visible during a two-and-a-half-hour walk along the Halic, or Golden Horn, which separates the Old City from the more contemporary Beyoglu. At the Fener (\u201clighthouse\u201d) bus stop, cross Abdulezelpasa Caddesi \u2014 the main shore road \u2014 and walk past the trinket shops to the walled compound that includes the Church of St. George, seat of the Eastern Orthodox Church. Inside, you\u2019ll find the ivory-inlaid throne of the patriarch, Bartholomew, and a wall of gilded icons. Farther up the main avenue is the golden-domed Church of St. Stephen of the Bulgars, constructed of iron panels that were cast in Vienna, barged down the Danube and pieced together here in the late 1800s.         \n\nContinue along Murselpasa Caddesi for a meatball break at \n(look for a Mavi Kose sign), then duck into the Jewish neighborhood of Balat to reach the intersection with Leblebiciler Sokak (the Sellers of Roasted Chickpeas Street). Straight ahead is the Yanbol Synagogue, named for a town in Bulgaria. Continuing deeper into Balat takes you to the Ahrida Synagogue, with its restored wooden interior dome.         \n\nHead back to the main road and walk along the waterside parks where Turkish families picnic. Pass under the highway bridge, past Feshane, a former Ottoman fez factory, cross the boulevard and walk past the souvenir market to the Eyup Sultan Mosque and the tomb of the standard-bearer for the Prophet Muhammad. Here you can see brides in lacy gowns praying and boys parading in white capes and caps as part of their circumcision rituals.         \n\nTo the left is a passageway uphill through a tulip-accented cemetery to the Pierre Loti Cafe, named for the French naval officer and novelist. From the cafe, over pistachio ice cream and coffee (still brewed over hot coals), you can see all the way to Topkapi Palace. \u2014 SUSANNE FOWLER         \n\n \n         \n\nThey nicknamed it the \u201cwobbly bridge\u201d when it opened, in 2000, because an engineering miscalculation caused it to sway so badly that people who tried to walk across it grew dizzy and even fell down. But after it was modified and opened again two years later, the Millennium Bridge, a pedestrian-only suspension bridge across the Thames, connecting Bankside on the south side to the City of London financial district on the north, became one of the great walking experiences in a city that might have been invented for strolling.         \n\nAt 1,006 feet long, the bridge takes just five minutes to cross, and can be a destination in itself. At one end is St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral, and that is where I like to start; you climb up to the top, and get someone to whisper at you from across the Whispering Gallery, and then climb down again. Then you walk straight down to the Thames and the bridge, slender and elegant in gleaming steel.         \n\nAs you cross, the noises and bustle of the city fade away, replaced by the caws of sea gulls. It smells like the sea. You think of Dickens, and the character dredged from the river in \u201cOur Mutual Friend.\u201d All of London seems laid out around you: Blackfriars Railway Bridge and Southwark Bridge up- and downriver;  \n a tall, thin, new addition to the London skyline, upriver; St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral, with the ovaloid building known as the Gherkin in the distance, behind you; the Tate Modern, a glorious celebration of art housed in an enormous building that was once a power station, directly in front. And next to that, the small and humble Globe Theater, a replica of Shakespeare\u2019s original theater, authentic even down to its thatched roof. There is no better spot than the Millennium Bridge from which to appreciate London as a palimpsest, the new gracefully overlaid on the old, as if every era co-existed with every other era in perpetuity, all at once. \u2014 SARAH LYALL         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://travel.nytimes.com/2013/04/21/travel/europe-in-9-walks.html", "date": "2013-04-19", "description": "From urban explorations in London and Prague to rustic treks in Tuscany and Scotland, this is slow travel for the senses."}
