{"headline": "Well-Chilled Drinks, Well-Read Bartender", "body": "\nDonatella Arpaia said that she had a simple set of requirements for  \n, the small, appealingly unassuming lounge that adjoins her Donatella restaurant in Chelsea.         \n\n\u201cI want the drinks to be cold, the bartender to be friendly, great food,\u201d she said. The bar, she added, should be a place where a person \u201cfeels like you can hang out.\u201d         \n\nAlso on her must list: great lighting fixtures.         \n\n\u201cI fell in love with the chandeliers from a picture in a magazine,\u201d she explained. \u201cThey are sexy and dramatic and, of course, were way too expensive.\u201d         \n\nThey really are good-looking and they provide a soft glow, although they would probably leave a stronger impression if they didn\u2019t compete for attention with two television screens showing, on two recent nights, reruns of the ABC show \u201cCastle\u201d or the movie \u201cDrumline.\u201d The volume is imperceptible \u2014 quiet drinks can be enjoyed here \u2014 but the screens are still a distraction.         \n\nEverything else on Ms. Arpaia\u2019s list gets a check. The drinks are well chilled and include a fine cocktail called the Chelsea Heat, with Sauza silver tequila, lime, muddled cucumber, and, for the heat portion of the program, pickled jalape\u00f1o; a bracing Moscow Mule made with Russian Standard vodka; a solid Stoli martini; and the refreshing Citrus Fizz, with Bombay Sapphire gin, Cointreau, lemon, St.-Germain elderflower liqueur and soda. (All cocktails are $12.) A Purato nero d\u2019Avola from Sicily, made from organic grapes, and a Kris malbec from northern Italy (both $9) are among the wines by the glass.         \n\nThe drinks list also includes a 20-ounce martini for sharing and punch bowls serving groups small ($50) and large ($90). The punch option is particularly popular on summer Sundays, Ms. Arpaia said, when customers have returned from out of town but want to keep the weekend going.         \n\nHappy hour here runs from 5 to 8 p.m. daily, during which a glass of Samuel Adams goes for $4, well drinks are $6 and several wines are available for the same price.         \n\nOn many nights the drinks are made and served by David Thigpen, an affable bartender who also writes plays. (For the record, he was impressed by Tom Stoppard\u2019s \u201cCoast of Utopia\u201d trilogy but left \u201cThe Book of Mormon\u201d at intermission.) He takes the food orders as well.         \n\nDBar recently introduced a menu that includes chicken wings and hamburgers, and dishes can be ordered from the Donatella menu, like the restaurant\u2019s estimable meatballs and pizzas.         \n\nMs. Arpaia\u2019s restaurant is known for the glittery gold pizza oven that produces those pies. But DBar, which once housed the relocated Tello\u2019s restaurant and feels as narrow as a car on the D train, is by design a darker space. The goal was a \u201cnighttimey\u201d vibe, she said, \u201cwhere you can share your secrets.\u201d         \n\nThat\u2019s a romantic notion, but the room is also conducive to talking about more whimsical subjects. On a recent night at DBar a friend and I shared an excellent Romana pizza ($12), which prompted a discussion about whether a featured ingredient, anchovy, would ever gain the widespread acceptance it certainly deserved.         \n\nWe contemplated that; had a few more bites. \u201cWe are,\u201d my friend said with a note of regret, \u201ca ways off from that.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/07/booming/donatella-arpaias-dbar-in-chelsea.html", "date": "2013-06-06", "description": "Dbar, Donatella Arpaia\u2019s new place on West 19th Street in Chelsea, has a soft glow, fine cocktails, tasty food and a happy hour that runs from 5 to 8 p.m. daily."}
