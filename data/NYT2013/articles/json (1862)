{"headline": "Who Made Movie Popcorn?", "body": "\nIn the 1920s, movie palaces rose up around the country like so many portals into a glamorous world. After you bought a ticket, you might pass through gilded archways and ascend a grand staircase lighted by a crystal chandelier to find your velvet seat. Eating was not meant to be part of the experience, says Andrew F. Smith, author of \u201cPopped Culture: A Social History of Popcorn in America.\u201d Theater owners feared that audiences would strew popcorn and peanuts on those crimson carpets. They hung signs discouraging people from bringing in food from vendors parked outside and didn\u2019t sell it themselves.         \n\nA widow named Julia Braden in Kansas City, Mo., was one of the rare concessionaires who managed to talk her way inside. She persuaded the Linwood Theater to let her set up a stand in the lobby and eventually built a popcorn empire. By 1931, she owned stands in or near four movie theaters and pulled in more than $14,400 a year \u2014 the equivalent of $336,000 in today\u2019s dollars. Her business grew even in the midst of the Depression, at the same time that thousands of elegant theaters went bust.         \n\nAccording to Smith, it\u2019s impossible to establish who sold the first box of movie popcorn. For decades, vendors operated out of wagons parked near theaters, circuses and ballparks, selling a variety of snacks. But Braden seems to have been among the first to set up concessions linked to movie houses \u2014 and to pioneer a new business strategy: the money was in popcorn, not ticket sales. (That\u2019s still true today. Movie theaters reap as much as 85 percent of their profits from concession sales.)         \n\nIn the mid-1930s, a manager named R. J. McKenna, who ran a chain of theaters in the West, caught on to this idea. An old man selling popcorn outside one of McKenna\u2019s movie houses amassed enough money to buy a house, a farm and a store. McKenna installed a popcorn machine in the lobby and collected the proceeds \u2014 as much as $200,000 in 1938. With that kind of money rolling in, who cared about the rugs? McKenna lowered the price of tickets just to draw more people to his concession stand. By the 1940s, most theaters had followed suit, and soon the smell of melted butter wafted through lobbies. One entrepreneur of the era offered the following advice: \u201cFind a good popcorn location and build a theater around it.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n\u00a0We use classical plant breeding, and one of the traits we look for is pop expansion \u2014 how big the kernel is after it pops.         \n\n \n\u00a0People prefer the larger-kernel corn. The flake has to be large and attractive. Also, by the way, there are two kinds of flake shapes: butterfly and mushroom. The butterfly flake \u2014 that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to see in the movie theater or what you\u2019re going to buy to pop at home. And then you\u2019ve probably seen what we call a mushroom flake when you\u2019re buying caramel corn.         \n\n \n\u00a0We use a machine that\u2019s just like what you\u2019d see at a movie theater. It has been modified with a giant graduated cylinder on its bottom, where normally the guy at the movie theater would be scooping popcorn into a box. That\u2019s so we can measure the volume of popped kernels.         \n\n \n\u00a0People will stop by and pick up bags. Some people feed it to their chickens.
