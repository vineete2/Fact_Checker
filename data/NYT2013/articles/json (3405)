{"headline": "Building Blocs, Not Lofts", "body": "\nDuring the Bloomberg era, which it now officially seems appropriate to talk about in the past tense, the term global city came into wide use to describe a New York not where strivers from around the world come to settle, but where the wealthy from London or Moscow or Mumbai merely pass through in a fever of luxury acquisition.         \n\nIf you had paid a visit to the campaign headquarters of  \n, who was running for the Democratic nomination for one of the many City Council seats that will change occupants this year, you might have been inclined to challenge the current vernacular. Mr. Reynoso, a young Dominican-American who grew up in Section 8 housing, defeated Vito J. Lopez, the disgraced former Brooklyn Democratic Party boss and assemblyman, with what in political terms is called a coalition, but which in practice seemed like something more sincere and less manufactured.         \n\nOn the day before Tuesday\u2019s primary, Mr. Reynoso\u2019s tiny storefront office on Williamsburg\u2019s south side was filled with old Hispanic men and the kind of 25- and 30-year-olds you instantly envision when your mind wanders to the category of Millennials Living in North Brooklyn. One lanky volunteer, a doctor\u2019s son named Kevin Worthington whom I accompanied as he tirelessly knocked on doors in the Bushwick Houses with a volunteer who lived there, had come to this particular moment from his native Strasbourg in France and via social justice work in Mexico. Other impassioned volunteers included Peter and Susan Restler, the parents of Lincoln Restler, a founder of the  \n, the liberal political club that is made up of young Obama supporters and that backed Mr. Reynoso.         \n\nPeter Restler is a partner at a private equity firm, and Ms. Restler is a former managing director at J. P. Morgan. \u201cThey are strong progressives,\u201d Lincoln Restler told me, which ought to tell us something about the kind of political variance that exists on Wall Street.         \n\nMr. Reynoso\u2019s victory was hardly assured, and it came about not simply because Mr. Lopez, who was accused of sexual harassment by Assembly staff members, is regarded with so much distaste by so many New Yorkers. In the Council district, which includes parts of Williamsburg and Bushwick, Mr. Lopez still retains considerable popularity. It was in large part the intense concern immigrant communities have over gentrification that led to Mr. Reynoso\u2019s prevailing.         \n\nThe same can be said of the success of another New Kings candidate,  \n. Mr. Menchaca, a 33-year-old Mexican-American who is gay, vanquished an entrenched politician for the Democratic nomination for a Council seat serving Red Hook and Sunset Park in Brooklyn.         \n\nAt the mayoral level, gentrification has been addressed only peripherally. Without sending a divisive message, Mr. Reynoso, who like Mr. Menchaca has no Republican opponent in the November election, spoke explicitly about the problems of displacement among Latinos who predominate in Williamsburg\u2019s south side, where he grew up \u2014 the thousands who have been forced deeper into Brooklyn over the past decade as Williamsburg has become an internationally understood signifier of cool.         \n\nMr. Menchaca similarly galvanized the Latino community in Sunset Park, where fears are mounting that the waterfront will be given over to lofts and chic living. On Tuesday afternoon I found Benito Bravo, a Latin dance choreographer well known in the Mexican community, on the corner of Fourth Avenue and 60th Street, where he had been standing for 10 and a half hours handing out literature for Mr. Menchaca. He didn\u2019t want his neighborhood bought out by developers, he told me, explaining that he had campaigned for Mr. Menchaca\u2019s opponent,  \n in the last election but found her ineffectual.         \n\nWorries that Sunset Park will become the next Williamsburg or Dumbo are hardly unfounded.  \n, a political action committee set up in part by real estate developers, spent an astonishing $7 million on Council races this year, close to $1 million of it in rapidly gentrifying areas like Astoria in Queens and Crown Heights and Clinton Hill in Brooklyn.         \n\nThe group spent close to $300,000 trying to get Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez re-elected, vastly more than Mr. Menchaca\u2019s campaign spent altogether. The $300,000 does not include the more than $50,000 the group spent specifically opposing Mr. Menchaca, printing fliers, for instance, that painted him as an arriviste who had moved to New York from Texas only recently, when he had in fact been here for nine years.         \n\nHardly an antagonist of the real estate industry, Mr. Menchaca had worked in economic development for Marty Markowitz, the Brooklyn borough president, before he took a job with the Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, doing outreach to gay men and lesbians.         \n\nIt is not simply Mr. Menchaca\u2019s triumph over moneyed interests that is so inspiring, but also the reach he achieved beyond his own world. In addition to having received the support of the young and well-off in Red Hook, he did well in Borough Park. There among the ultra-Orthodox Jews who could not live more removed from the universe of the  \n, he got 60 percent of the vote. Wednesday was Mr. Menchaca\u2019s birthday, and there was every reason to have a good time.
