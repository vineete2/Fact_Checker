Meta, as repurposed by the N.S.A., succinctly redefines our trans-post-postmodern era.         \n\nWelcome to the age of Heavy Meta.         \n\nMeta, which stems from the Greek word for \u201cafter,\u201d \u201cbeyond,\u201d \u201cbeside\u201d (or change of place, order or condition), existed for centuries in obscurity in the hard sciences \u2014 it was perhaps best identified with the scholars who assembled Aristotle\u2019s fourth-century-B.C. papers and used meta as part of the title for one of his most famous works, \u201cMetaphysics.\u201d (So named either because it was work that went beyond Aristotle\u2019s \u201cPhysics\u201d or because it came after his other canonical works.)         \n\nIn the early 20th century, fourth-wall transgressors in the world of theater (Bertolt Brecht, Luigi Pirandello) adopted meta and gave it a modern spin, exploiting its sense of beyondness as a way to dramatize the possibilities of a self-aware audience. Nevertheless, for the first part of the 20th century, the term rarely made it outside the rarefied air of academia, where intellectuals used it to study what others were studying (in fields like metamathematics or metapsychology).         \n\nMetafiction, a movement of the 1960s and \u201970s, served as a bridge between olden meta and future meta. Practitioners like John Barth, Donald Barthelme and Robert Coover tutored readers \u2014 sometimes pedantically, sometimes playfully \u2014 in the artificiality of what it was they were writing and their audiences were reading. They often did so not just winkingly but overknowingly, as if they were more in on the joke than anyone else.         \n\nBy the early \u201990s, high meta had turned into low meta, as the individual self-awareness (of Antonin Artaud or Jorge Luis Borges) gave way to indulgent self-referencing (Philip Roth, \u201cSeinfeld\u201d), which gave way to meta as a stand-alone word. If, say, a conversation turned into a conversation about the conversation? Meta. A \u201cthat\u2019s so meta\u201d refrain became part of the ethos of \u201cFamily Guy,\u201d reality TV, insidery advertising and self-conscious memoirs.         \n\nIn short, meta became shorthand for knowingness. It went beyond beyond. And it used to be fun. Meta could be used to mean something you knew wasn\u2019t true but you believed in anyway. Or it could mean you weren\u2019t quite sure if something was or wasn\u2019t true \u2014 an ambiguity that was as playful as it was, well, metaphysical. Meta also raised profound artistic and philosophical questions about truth, reality and identity. But those meatier and rompier ventures into metahood (via Borges, Philip K. Dick, David Foster Wallace, Zadie Smith and others) have been superseded by the endless depth and breadth of the Internet (meta on steroids) and the triumphal pervasiveness of social media.         \n\nWe got to the point where we were so in on the joke that we already knew the punch line. Or rather, we knew, or thought we knew, every (possible) punch line. And it\u2019s this knowingness, a knowingness not based in or on knowledge or experience but simply in the recognition of the artifice at hand, that has arguably numbed us to ourselves, to each other, to love, to freedom, to activism and agitation and protest, to the very act of creating something unironic or nonmeta. Paradoxically, the metadata that our government and our communications giants have been gathering is something this very cynicism of ours helped create.
