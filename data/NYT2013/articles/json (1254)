{"headline": "For Some Landlords, Real Money in the Homeless", "body": "\nWilly Machan acknowledges he is a gadfly, someone who writes bristling letters to local officials to get conditions improved in his grim single-room-occupancy building. But he was surprised by what his landlord offered last July to persuade him to move out of the room he has lived in since 1984 and for which he pays $371 a month.         \n\n\u201cIf you are not happy, I will give you $25,000 cash,\u201d he recalled the landlord\u2019s representative telling him.         \n\nThough barely getting by on  \n, Mr. Machan, a 68-year-old retiree, turned down the offer, saying he had nowhere else to go. But some of his neighbors in the building on the Upper West Side of Manhattan \u2014 where the 71 rent-paying residents share bathrooms and there is no kitchen \u2014 told others they accepted similar cash payouts with the excitement of lottery winners and quickly vacated.         \n\nThe landlord, Alan Lapes, was clearing out these tenants to accommodate a group of people not often regarded as desirable: New York\u2019s homeless.         \n\nThe city\u2019s Department of Homeless Services pays many times the amount the rooms would usually rent for \u2014 spending over $3,000 a month for each threadbare room without a bathroom or kitchen \u2014 because of an acute shortage in shelters for homeless men and women.         \n\nIndeed, the amount the city pays \u2014 roughly half that amount goes to the landlord, while the other half pays for security and social services for homeless tenants \u2014 has encouraged Mr. Lapes to switch business models and become a major private operator of homeless shelters. He is by most measures the city\u2019s largest and owns or leases about 20 of the 231 shelters citywide. Most of the other shelters and residences are run by the city or by nonprofit agencies, but his operation is profit-making, prompting criticism from advocates for the homeless and elected officials.         \n\nMr. Lapes has lately stirred anger for his contracts through the Department of Homeless Services. More than 200 residents and elected officials packed a community meeting last week to express outrage at the transformation of two buildings he owns on West 95th Street into homeless shelters, without the usual public and legislative scrutiny.         \n\n\u201cThe city needs to make sure there\u2019s affordable housing instead of waiting for shysters to come forward to make thousands of dollars off these poor unfortunate people,\u201d State Assemblywoman Linda B. Rosenthal, a Manhattan Democrat, said at the meeting, promising to push for reforms. \u201cGetting rid of the profit motive will reduce some of the bad actors.\u201d         \n\nMr. Lapes, 49, has been willing to weather the blistering response because of how lucrative these shelters have become. Mr. Lapes, who has a home in Upper Saddle River, N.J., that was valued in 2005 at $3.3 million, did not return numerous messages left at his home, office and homeless shelters seeking comment.         \n\nThe fact that these modest living spaces have such high rents opens a window on a peculiarity of the city\u2019s overall homeless policy. That policy, which was put in place in response to court settlements in 1979 and 2008, requires the city, under threat of sizable fines, to find a roof immediately for every homeless person. It has given landlords willing to house the homeless leverage to dictate rental prices and other terms.         \n\nAlthough the 95th Street shelter where Mr. Machan lives has been opened under \u201cemergency\u201d rules, the contract is for five years at $122 daily per room and will cost the city a total of $47 million. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried hard to make sure we\u2019re getting the best deal for the city,\u201d Seth Diamond, the commissioner of homeless services, said at the meeting in response to the criticism.         \n\nWith the number of homeless people rising to 30-year record levels \u2014 over 47,216 people as of early this month, 20,000 of them children \u2014 the city has struggled to find landlords willing to accommodate a population that includes people with mental health and substance abuse problems. So the city has resorted to housing adults in single-room-occupancy buildings originally designed for long-term residents who pay stabilized rents. The city also often relies on sites with troubled histories, like a long vacant 10-condominium building at 165 West Ninth Street in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, owned by Mr. Lapes, where it wants to house 170 homeless men.
