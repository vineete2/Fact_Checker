{"headline": "After 30 Years, They\u2019re Still in Concert", "body": "\n \n         \n\nMichael and Chava Levy began dating 30 years ago after a decade of missed connections. They married Aug. 14, 1983, and today live in Woodmere, N.Y. Michael, who is blind, works for the New York City Transit Authority as the director of travel training, and Chava, a polio survivor, has a background in singing. She is writing a memoir to be entitled, \u201cA Life Not With Standing.\u201d The couple has two adult children. A condensed and edited version of our conversation follows.         \n\n \n         \n\nChava: Our paths kept crossing, even 10 years before we got married. I first saw him sing in a choir in Jerusalem and then at a singles luncheon on the West Side. It seemed that every time I saw him he was with a woman. In June 1982, I gave a concert and afterward a friend came backstage with Michael. He complimented the concert and I said that we ought to get together. He said that would be really nice, but I never heard from him.         \n\nMichael: Imagine yourself meeting a performer at a concert. People think that it\u2019s easy for guys, but I\u2019m thinking that I really have to impress her.         \n\nChava: Something happened that on the surface was very bad, but we see it as God playing matchmaker. It was Sunday, Oct. 17, 1982, and I was listening to WQXR, and the announcer said, \u201cWe will be right back after the news at the top of the hour.\u201d I don\u2019t like listening to the news so I went to turn off my stereo. I can walk a little bit, but I took a few steps to the stereo and lost my balance and fell. I was lying there listening to the news and afterward this program started and it was just incredible. It was an hour featuring the music of  \n, a Dutch soprano, and I found myself transported and suddenly very tranquil. At the end the host said that she would be doing a recital at Alice Tully Hall. I hadn\u2019t expected anyone until the next day, when a woman was due to come and help me get dressed and ready for work, but then I heard my parents unlocking the front door. They got me off the floor and the next day I bought two tickets to the Elly Ameling concert. I called 25 people but no one could go, including Michael. But five weeks later he invited me to another concert at Avery Fisher Hall. It was Dec. 6, 1982, our first date.         \n\n \n         \n\nChava: It was instant. We would end up talking on the phone and realize that three hours had gone by.         \n\nMichael: We dated from December until May and that was really only because my parents were in Florida for the winter and I didn\u2019t want to get engaged without them meeting her. But what can I say? We knew. I had just graduated from social work school and it took me a year and a half to find a job. My father had always said you don\u2019t get married until you have a job, so I had it in my head that I couldn\u2019t ask her, but a friend of mine said: \u201cYou will eventually get a job. Why suffer on two counts?\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nChava: We were studying the Bible at my apartment.         \n\nMichael: I had hidden in her closet a poem that I had written. I couldn\u2019t ask; I wasn\u2019t that brave. She was reading this poem in Hebrew and English and by Line 12 she realized that it was a proposal. We married in August and I got a job in January as a benefits counselor for the handicapped in Brooklyn.         \n\n \n         \n\nChava: We were both dead set against marrying someone with a disability. It\u2019s a piece of who we are but certainly not what defines us and what was so thrilling was that we had so much else in common. We are both very attached to Jewish tradition, we both love music, words, kids, and then we both have disabilities. It\u2019s been symbiotic; it happens that the things he cannot do, I can, and what I can\u2019t do, thank God, he can.         \n\nMichael: People would want to set you up with people who are disabled just because of that without knowing anything else about you and it\u2019s dehumanizing because they are saying that your central quality is that you lack something.         \n\nChava: I think we were pretty careful not to fall into this trap of becoming a burden to each other. I am always happy that there are things that I can do for him. We have a housekeeper now who is here from 9 to 6. If it weren\u2019t for having help I would worry about being a burden.         \n\nMichael: We had both lived alone for many years, so why should it be harder if we have support? There are people who refuse to be helped and I understand that; everyone has their own way of dealing with it. I used to be very reluctant, and now I am only somewhat reluctant.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/04/booming/after-30-years-theyre-still-in-concert.html", "date": "2013-10-04", "description": "Chava and Michael Levy have been married 30 years and find that they complement each other in their strengths, weaknesses and enthusiasms."}
