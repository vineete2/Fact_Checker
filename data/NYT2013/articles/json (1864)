{"headline": "Summer Camp for the Winter Olympics", "body": "\nWANAKA, New Zealand \u2014 From the bottom, they look like butterflies, dropping soundlessly into the halfpipe and soaring high above its walls, spinning and flipping, flashes of color cascading over the whiteness. It\u2019s only after they skid to a stop and lift their bug-eyed goggles that you see the dreadlocks and soul patches, the Rockstar and Monster energy-drink logos, the tie-dye slickers and the ubiquitous ear buds.         \n\nSnowboarders remain locked in their heads as they compete to their personal soundtracks. Shredders are big on lifestyle and community, but on this beautiful and remote halfpipe, they are focused and withdrawn.         \n\nEvery August, the world\u2019s best snowboarders come to work on big-air and physics-defying tricks in this tiny town hidden by mountains and surrounded by sheep. The athletes flock here for one reason: Wanaka has the only Olympic-size halfpipe open anywhere in the world at that time of year.         \n\nThat means, especially heading into an Olympic year, Wanaka becomes a ground zero of aerial somersaults and 360-degree flips that is unlike anything else on the planet.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a community, and there\u2019s a lot of support, no matter what your country,\u201d said Gretchen Bleiler, who won a silver medal for the United States at the 2006 Turin Games. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to lie: there\u2019s a lot more intensity than usual.\u201d         \n\nDays begin in the predawn darkness with athletes boarding vans for the one-hour ride up the mountain.         \n\nBy noon, they are back in town and in the gym, keenly aware that the friends they are training with are also their competitors.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like \u2018Groundhog Day,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said J. J. Thomas, a United States bronze medalist in 2002 at the Salt Lake Games. \u201cWe do the same thing over and over.\u201d         \n\nBut in Wanaka, the days are broken up with field trips to settings so stunning they belong in a snow globe. It\u2019s a place for camaraderie, where riders from Norway and Russia, Spain and Japan share a playground in the afternoon and, often, a Speight\u2019s beer at night in the local pubs.         \n\nBut it is also a place of fierce competition and heightened tension. The Winter Olympics, after all, are coming in February, and there are more exceptional halfpipe riders than there are spots in Sochi, Russia.         \n\nFor all the natural beauty, the halfpipe is clearly the main attraction. It\u2019s where the freestyle creed of all fun and no fear is exposed as a lie. It\u2019s where an over-rotated hip or turned-out foot can scramble your brains or compress your spine.         \n\nWhen the pipe gets noisy, everyone here knows it means something went terribly wrong. Crashes occurred most mornings: shoulders were separated, bruises counted and stitches pulled through. Sometimes, it was much worse.         \n\nOne morning, with the sunshine lending the mountain a rouge halo and fresh snow plumped into what looked like a comfortable pillow, the halfpipe got loud. It began with a collective groan and sickening thwack as Luke Mitrani, an American, fell 40 feet from the sky and landed square on his back as if he were shot out of a cannon.         \n\nNext came blasts of crunching ice as coaches, teammates and medical personnel dropped to their knees and slid into the pipe to reach Mitrani near the bottom. No one floated down it and into the air. Goggles were up and ear buds out as the world\u2019s best snowboarders waited for Mitrani to turn a foot or raise a finger.         \n\nHe was perfectly still.         \n\nThe riders were out of their own heads now. A few made their way down to take a look before sliding to the bottom of the mountain. No one felt like training anymore. Most looked away when the snowmobile arrived and Mitrani was gently put on the stretcher it was dragging. Soon, a helicopter arrived. Mitrani, 23, was loaded aboard for a two-hour flight to Christchurch.         \n\n \n         \n\nThis is no country for the vertiginous. Narrow roads with hairpin switchbacks vein the Southern Alps, the name given to this mountain range on New Zealand\u2019s South Island by the British explorer James Cook in 1770. There are no guardrails, and members of the United States team barely look at the sheer cliffs and heart-swallowing drops outside the van. Many of them have been visiting for more than a decade, but it\u2019s hard getting used to these white-knuckle drives.         \n\nTo relieve the tedium of training, the snowboarders turned their August afternoons into an extreme summer camp meets international mixer, scattering to the four corners of Middle-earth \u2014 or at least the cinematic stand-in for  \n\u2019s fictional universe. The enchanted rain forests,  \n pools and ethereal glaciers made this a natural stage for the native son Peter Jackson and his \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d trilogy, as well as an irresistible playground for the shredder set.         \n\nOn the American team, Arielle Gold, 17, and her brother Taylor, 19, went sky diving. Louie Vito is a veteran bungee jumper here, and Elena Hight has kayaked and paraglided on Lake Wanaka.
