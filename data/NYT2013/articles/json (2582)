{"headline": "From Fashion to Crashing at County Fairs", "body": "\nNew York\u2019s fall Fashion Week starts in a few days, but you won\u2019t find me staking out Lincoln Center to steal a glimpse of a model or designer. I\u2019ve already had my fill of runway glamour this summer, at the Cloverbud division of the 4-H Fashion Revue at the Becker County Fair in Detroit Lakes, Minn. Better yet, I didn\u2019t have to flash press credentials: there was no security at the red-and-white striped tent. And there were plenty of places to sit \u2014 comfy bales of hay instead of chairs crammed onto risers \u2014 and watch the kids (kindergartners through third graders) show off the ensembles they\u2019ve put together (that is, bought at the mall).         \n\n\u201cBrooke\u2019s dress is made of 65 percent polyester and 35 percent rayon for the skirt, and then 70 percent cotton and 30 percent nylon on the upper part,\u201d said the announcer, as a young girl stepped forward. \u201cIt\u2019s very versatile. She\u2019s going to wear it to school, church, friends\u2019 birthday parties or just to go shopping. Brooke, what was your favorite part of the project?\u201d         \n\nLong pause, and then barely a peep: \u201cShopping with my mom.\u201d         \n\nI\u2019m always urging friends from abroad to get out of New York and into real America, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to do as well this summer, by driving from Baton Rouge, La., to Fargo, N.D. And I don\u2019t know if I could think of a moment that smacked more of Americana than the 4-H Cloverbud fashion show, just over from the fried cheese curd stand.         \n\nOr maybe that moment was the day before, when I was a couple hours south at the Kandiyohi County Fair in Willmar, watching slightly older kids lead their beef cattle and dairy cows around the 4-H arena, trying to win a blue ribbon and qualify for the Minnesota State Fair. (You can see more in the video above.)         \n\nIt also might have been earlier that same morning in Becker County, when I attended the round-robin showmanship contest, when the kid who wins the award for one species \u2014 say, swine \u2014 has to test his or her hand at showing other animals. It felt as though the World Series victors were taking on the Super Bowl champs at ice hockey, though on a slightly smaller scale.         \n\nIf no event on my path this summer was more national in scope than the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally  \n in South Dakota, then nothing could be more local than a county fair. In Kansas,  \n on my first, completely by accident, only to wish I could stay for more.         \n\nMy planned route to Fargo \u2014 where I was due to end my trip a few days later \u2014 passed through western Minnesota, which is thick with county fairs in August. (In much of the region, county fairs take place throughout July and August; Minnesota\u2019s tourism Web site,  \n, allows you to search for fairs by date.)         \n\nFor the uninitiated, a county fair primer: There\u2019s the midway, the area for Ferris wheels and merry-go-rounds and games where kids throw or shoot at targets and win big stuffed animals of extremely low quality, and plenty of cotton candy stands. There are stages for live entertainment; displays for 4-H and FFA (formerly Future Farmers of America); and booths set up by area organizations like the one from the Willmar Curling Club, where two blond girls gave me a complete lesson on the Olympic sport most Americans know nothing about. Stuff geared toward children abounds, like pig races at Kandiyohi and a performance at Becker by the lasso-wielding, bad-joke-slinging \u201ccowboy,\u201d T. Texas Terry.         \n\nAnd of course there are the livestock shows. All week, children who have spent much of the last year raising a goat or lamb or hen or pig or calf bring their animal to the fair to be evaluated. The competitions are the main spectacle, but the sprawling barns are open to the public as well; they turn into huge petting zoos and attract many a toddler \u2014 and the occasional New York-based travel writer.         \n\nAt Kandiyohi, I hung out with the llamas; at Becker, I marveled at the Dwarf Hotot rabbits, which are plump and round and snow white except for the bands of black around their eyes: furballs gone Goth. I was also struck repeatedly by the kids\u2019 nonchalance in the face of the rather unpleasant cleanup aspects of farm work; I challenge city kids to go and not giggle. I was somewhat challenged myself when a 6-year-old named Derek, who had raised a calf named Cocoa, told me how he tells the boys calves from the girls: \u201cThe boy pees from his bottom and the girl pees from his back.\u201d        ", "url": "http://travel.nytimes.com/2013/08/27/travel/from-fashion-to-crashing-at-county-fairs.html", "date": "2013-08-27", "description": "Nearing the end of his summer road trip, the Frugal Traveler stops in Minnesota where he sits runway-side for a fashion show and catches his first demolition derby."}
