{"headline": "Weight Led Governor to Surgery", "body": "\nGov. Chris Christie of New Jersey ascended to become one of the country\u2019s top political stars almost in spite of his weight \u2014 dismissing those who questioned whether his size disqualified him for higher office as \u201cridiculous\u201d and \u201cirresponsible.\u201d         \n\nNow, like some overweight politicians before him, Mr. Christie has embarked on a major effort to shed pounds at a time when his eyes are on the presidency. Saying that \u201ca whole bunch of other things\u201d had not worked, he revealed on Tuesday that he had undergone weight loss surgery three months ago. He is now 40 pounds lighter.         \n\nMr. Christie, a Republican, said concerns about his family, not politics, drove him to undergo the \u201cLap-Band\u201d procedure, in which a silicone band is placed around the stomach to discourage overeating.         \n\nHis staff and even his closest political advisers said they had not known he had the operation or had even considered having it.         \n\nBut in the image-conscious world of politics, the questions about what effect slimming down would have on a possible presidential run immediately dominated the discussion of his move. Mr. Christie\u2019s heft has been part of his brand. Would he risk losing some of his Everyman appeal along with the weight?         \n\nThe governor swatted those questions again. \u201cWhatever size I happen to be when I have to make decisions about what to do next in my career, I doubt that will play any role or effect in what I decide to do,\u201d he told reporters massed outside an event in Newark. \u201cIt\u2019s not a career issue for me; it is a long-term health issue for me.\u201d         \n\nFair or not, weight has been often used as a metaphor to judge Mr. Christie.         \n\nTo his critics, it represented his lack of discipline and his bullying manner \u2014 an advertisement by his opponent in the 2009 governor\u2019s race showed unflattering pictures of his size  \nTo his supporters, it softened his edges and made him more relatable \u2014 Mike DuHaime, his chief political strategist, has often said that voters want someone \u201cjust like them, only smarter.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI think Governor Christie has almost played off the fact that he is big,\u201d said former Gov. Edward G. Rendell, a Pennsylvania Democrat who has struggled himself to shed unwanted pounds.         \n\n\u201cIt has helped establish him as a real person,\u201d he said, noting that people are skeptical of perfectly combed \u201cJohn Edwardshair\u201d and no visible physical flaws. \u201cIn a strange way, it was political asset to him.\u201d         \n\nThe political pressures are real in a country that has not elected  \n since William Howard Taft more than a century ago. Former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas lost more than a hundred pounds before seeking the Republican presidential nomination in 2008. Former Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi told reporters interested in whether he would seek the 2012 Republican nomination to watch his waistline for clues.         \n\nAnd last year, as Mr. Christie was considered a presidential and then a vice-presidential possibility, some Republican donors couched their reservations with the observation that it was rare to see people as heavy as he is living to an old age. He was not happy that the operation was made public, and neither, he said, were his wife and four children. According to his staff, he acknowledged the procedure in an interview with The New York Post after the newspaper called to say they were running an article about it.         \n\nHis office initially said he would answer no more questions about it, but he eventually agreed to take questions at a news conference on Tuesday.         \n\nHe did so for more than 40 minutes, calling the fascination with his surgery \u201cridiculous and silly.\u201d         \n\n\u201cYou know, people in public life have the same concerns that people in private life have,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cJust because I have a public office and I have some measure of notoriety doesn\u2019t mean that my feelings about my family and my concerns about their future are any different than yours or anybody else that\u2019s sitting here.\u201d         \n\nAs the obesity epidemic in the country has grown, surgical interventions have become more common. Two of the more common surgical options for people seeking to lose weight: banding and its riskier predecessor, gastric bypass surgery.         \n\nIn choosing to undergo the banding procedure, Mr. Christie joins a list of public figures \u2014 including \n, whom Mr. Christie consulted before the surgery,  \n and  \n \u2014 who have turned to surgery to help where diet and exercise have failed.         \n\nMr. Barbour, who is close to Mr. Christie, said political concerns motivated Mr. Barbour to lose 30 pounds during his 2003 campaign for governor. \u201cIt is no secret to voters who don\u2019t know a candidate can sometimes be put off by that candidate\u2019s being overweight,\u201d he said.         \n\nMr. Christie has often spoke of his struggles to lose weight, which he said started to become an issue in his 20s, when he stopped playing organized sports.         \n\nHis sense of urgency about losing weight had increased since he turned 50, he said.         \n\nEven those close to him who noticed his recent weight loss presumed that it was another down in what has been a yo-yo cycle. The governor has never revealed his exact weight, but it has been reported at being from 300 to 350 pounds. In July 2011, he was hospitalized briefly after having an asthma attack.         \n\nIn February, about a week before the surgery, Mr. Christie made light of the issue  \n.\u201d         \n\nBut around the same time he also got into  \n who expressed concerns about his weight potentially causing him to die in office, telling her to \u201cshut up.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/08/nyregion/chris-christie-secretly-had-weight-loss-surgery.html", "date": "2013-05-07", "description": "Gov.
