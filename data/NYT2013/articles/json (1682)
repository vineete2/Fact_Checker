{"headline": "N.S.A. Often Broke Rules on Privacy, Audit Shows", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The  \n violated privacy rules protecting the communications of Americans and others on domestic soil 2,776 times over a one-year period, according  \n and made public on Thursday night.         \n\nThe violations, according to the May 2012 audit, stemmed largely from operator and system errors like \u201cinadequate or insufficient research\u201d when selecting wiretap targets.         \n\nThe largest number of episodes \u2014 1,904 \u2014 appeared to be \u201croamers,\u201d in which a foreigner whose cellphone was being wiretapped without a warrant came to the United States, where individual warrants are required. A spike in such problems in a single quarter, the report said, could be because of Chinese citizens visiting friends and family for the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday.         \n\n\u201cRoamer incidents are largely unpreventable, even with good target awareness and traffic review, since target travel activities are often unannounced and not easily predicted,\u201d the report says.         \n\nThe report and several other documents leaked by Mr. Snowden  \n. They shed new light on the intrusions into Americans\u2019 privacy that N.S.A. surveillance can entail, and how the agency handles violations of its rules.         \n\nMr. Snowden, who was recently granted temporary asylum in Russia, is believed to have given the documents to The Post months ago.         \n\nThe Post, which did not publish every document its accompanying article relied upon, cited other problems as well. In one case in 2008 that was not reported to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court or Congress, it said, the system collected metadata logs about a \u201clarge number\u201d of calls dialed from Washington \u2013 something it was already doing through a different program \u2013 because of a programming error mixing up the district\u2019s area code, 202, with the international dialing code of Egypt, 20.         \n\nJameel Jaffer of the American Civil Liberties Union said that while some of the compliance violations were more troubling than others, the sheer number of them was \u201cjaw-dropping.\u201d         \n\nIn a statement, the N.S.A. said its surveillance activities \u201care continually audited and overseen internally and externally.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWhen N.S.A. makes a mistake in carrying out its foreign intelligence mission, the agency reports the issue internally and to federal overseers \u2014 and aggressively gets to the bottom of it,\u201d the statement said.         \n\nAnother newly disclosed document included instructions for how N.S.A. analysts should record their rationales for eavesdropping under the FISA Amendments Act, or F.A.A., which allows wiretapping without warrants on domestic networks if the target is a noncitizen abroad. The document said analysts should keep descriptions of why the people they are targeting merit wiretapping to \u201cone short sentence\u201d and avoid details like their names and supporting information.         \n\n\u201cWhile we do want to provide our F.A.A. overseers with the information they need, we DO NOT want to give them any extraneous information,\u201d it said.         \n\nA brief article in an internal N.S.A. newsletter offered hints about a known but little-understood episode in which the  \n found in 2011 that the N.S.A. had violated the  \n. The newsletter said the court issued an 80-page ruling on Oct. 3, 2011, finding that something the N.S.A. was collecting involving \u201cMultiple Communications Transactions\u201d on data flowing through fiber-optic networks on domestic soil was \u201cdeficient on statutory and constitutional grounds.\u201d         \n\nIn a statement, the N.S.A. said the problem related to \u201ca very specific and highly technical aspect,\u201d which it reported to the court and Congress \u201conce the issue was identified and fully understood.\u201d Privacy protections for Americans were strengthened, it said, and the court allowed the surveillance to continue.
