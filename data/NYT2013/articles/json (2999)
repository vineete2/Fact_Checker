{"headline": "Curious Grade for Teachers: Nearly All Pass", "body": "\nAcross the country, education reformers and their allies in both parties have revamped the way teachers are graded, abandoning methods under which nearly everyone was deemed satisfactory, even when students were falling behind.         \n\nMore than half the states now require new teacher evaluation systems and, thanks to a deal announced last week in Albany, New York City will soon have one, too.         \n\nThe changes, already under way in some cities and states, are intended to provide meaningful feedback and, critically, to weed out weak performers. And here are some of the early results:         \n\nIn Florida, 97 percent of teachers were deemed effective or highly effective in the most recent evaluations. In Tennessee, 98 percent of teachers were judged to be \u201cat expectations.\u201d         \n\nIn Michigan, 98 percent of teachers were rated effective or better.         \n\nAdvocates of education reform concede that such rosy numbers, after many millions of dollars developing the new systems and thousands of hours of training, are worrisome.         \n\n\u201cIt is too soon to say that we\u2019re where we started and it\u2019s all been for nothing,\u201d said Sandi Jacobs, vice president of the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and policy organization. \u201cBut there are some alarm bells going off.\u201d         \n\nThe new systems, a central achievement of the reform movement, generally rate teachers on a combination of student progress, including their test scores, and observations by principals or others. The Obama administration has encouraged states to adopt the new methods through grant programs like Race to the Top.         \n\nThe teachers might be rated all above average, like students in Lake Wobegon, for the same reason that the older evaluation methods were considered lacking. Principals, who are often responsible for the personal-observation part of the grade, generally are not detached managerial types and can be loath to give teachers low marks.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real culture shift that has to occur and there\u2019s a lot of evidence that that hasn\u2019t occurred yet,\u201d Ms. Jacobs said.         \n\nBut even the part of the grade that was intended to be objective, how students perform on standardized tests, has proved squishy. In part, this is because tests have changed so much in recent years \u2014 and are changing still, because of the new \u201cCommon Core\u201d curriculum standards that most states have adopted \u2014 that administrators have been unwilling to set the test-score bar too high for teachers. In many states, consecutive \u201cineffective\u201d ratings are grounds for firing.         \n\n\u201cWe have changed proficiency standards 21 times in the last six years,\u201d Jackie Pons, the schools superintendent for Leon County, Fla., said. In the county, 100 percent of the teachers were rated \u201chighly effective\u201d or \u201ceffective.\u201d         \n\n\u201cHow can you evaluate someone in a system when you change your levels all the time?\u201d Mr. Pons asked.         \n\nUntil recently, Florida teachers were typically observed once a year for about 20 minutes and deemed satisfactory or unsatisfactory. Roughly 100 percent of them were rated satisfactory in 2010-11. Florida districts are spending $43 million in federal Race to the Top grant money on devising and beginning new methods.         \n\nGenerally, 50 percent of the evaluation is now based on administrators\u2019 observations of teachers and 50 percent on student growth as measured by test scores (districts can alter that ratio to some extent). For the observation part, teachers are no longer rated simply on \u201cclassroom management\u201d and \u201cplanning,\u201d but rather on 60 specific elements, including \u201cengaging students in cognitively complex tasks involving hypothesis generation\u201d and \u201ctesting and demonstrating value and respect for low expectancy students.\u201d         \n\nOne Leon County principal, Melissa Fullmore of Ruediger Elementary school in Tallahassee, said that had it been solely up to her, one or two of her teachers would have been graded \u201chighly effective,\u201d the top category. Three would have been marked \u201cneeds improvement,\u201d one rung up from the bottom, and the rest would have fallen under \u201ceffective.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/31/education/curious-grade-for-teachers-nearly-all-pass.html", "date": "2013-03-30", "description": "New teacher evaluation systems were intended to provide useful feedback and weed out weak performers, but the reluctance to set a high bar has led to scores that seem impossibly rosy."}
