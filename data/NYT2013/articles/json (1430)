He is a professor of psychology at the University of Akron, was president of the American Psychological Association and is an author or editor of 14 books, including \u201cMen and Sex: New Psychological Perspectives.\u201d Following are samples of the kinds of questions he is prepared to answer \u2014 from men and from women about men. \n         \n\nMy wife has let herself go of late, gained a lot of weight, and I don\u2019t find her sexually appealing now. Whenever I raise the subject, she gets very quiet and doesn\u2019t talk to me for the rest of the evening. Any tips on how to break through?         \n\nI am a bit of a late bloomer, but recently met a wonderful woman. We have not gotten intimate yet primarily because I am concerned about the size of my penis, which is quite small. I have read advice columns that say that penis size is not inherently a problem in romantic relationships, but I have no idea about how to discuss this with her. How should I approach this?         \n\nI am recently remarried, and my new wife and I are out of synch when it comes to love-making. Although I am 57, I still want to make love several times a week, but my wife would be happy with twice a month. We have talked about this but seem to be at an impasse. How can we resolve it?         \n\nI have recently started a relationship with a man whom I adore. We have discussed making this a committed relationship, but he seems to want to stretch the definition of commitment. He says we should occasionally involve other guys that we might meet casually, just to \u201cmix things up,\u201d which he thinks will be stimulating for our relationship, but I find the idea threatening. What if he and the other guy hit it off and leave me in the dust? How can I get him to see my point of view?         \n\nI love my wife and we have a great sexual relationship although it has slowed down as we both have aged. I feel sexually frustrated and have recently been turning to Internet porn. Over the last few months, I have felt a need to watch more and more intense videos to arouse me. Could I have an Internet porn addiction?         \n\nPlease leave your questions in the comments section.
