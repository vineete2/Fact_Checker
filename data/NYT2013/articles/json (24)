{"headline": "Relocation Therapy", "body": "\nALMOST four years ago, Marilyn Kotcher suddenly became a widow. And the large \u2014 2,250-square-foot \u2014 condominium in Fort Lee, N.J., that she and her husband had bought together and lovingly remodeled no longer seemed like home.         \n\n\u201cIt had a lot of wonderful memories for me,\u201d said Ms. Kotcher, a clinical social worker. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t have a sense of belonging there anymore.\u201d         \n\nShe was similarly disenchanted with Fort Lee. \u201cI felt very isolated,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are just a lot of large buildings on the water. If you\u2019re part of a couple, it\u2019s O.K., but I wanted a sense of community.\u201d         \n\nIn the past, space had always trumped location for Ms. Kotcher when it came to choosing a home. Now, location was going to be her priority. And so it was that last May she moved to a one-bedroom rental on East 79th Street in Manhattan. \u201cI had a zillion friends in New Jersey, but I would never just bump into them,\u201d she said. \u201cIn Manhattan if I run into someone on Second Avenue, we go out for coffee.\u201d         \n\nThat kind of spontaneity reminds her of college dorm life, though the adult version has \u201ceveryone in a separate apartment.\u201d On the Upper East Side, she said, \u201cI can always find something to do. A long weekend no longer creates any anxiety for me.\u201d         \n\nLegions swear by retail therapy as a way of dealing with a bad day at the office, a bad hair day or a really bad number on the bathroom scale. But people who are going through more substantial life crises \u2014 the death of a loved one, illness, divorce, a messy breakup \u2014 may be able to work through the pain with the aid of real estate therapy. A new home, after all, can be much more than a change of address.         \n\n\u201cIf real estate is a big part of your problem, it\u2019s possible that real estate can solve it,\u201d said Elayne Reimer, an executive vice president of Halstead Property and a former marriage and family counselor. \u201cIf you live a two-hour commute from work, moving closer to the job might be very beneficial to your health, and to improving relations with family members because you\u2019d have more time for them.\u201d         \n\nBut \u201ca lot of people use real estate as an escape,\u201d she added. \u201cIf you\u2019re living in the suburbs and you aren\u2019t happy in your home life, you may think if you move to the city your life will be better. But the location isn\u2019t going to make a difference if the unhappiness is internal.\u201d         \n\nWhen you decide that a new residence is the best solution to a problem, your emotional baggage gets loaded in the moving van along with the linen and flatware, said Beth Fisher, a senior managing director of the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group. \u201cBut changing real estate can really be psychologically healthy under certain circumstances.\u201d         \n\nSuch circumstances include what can be described as the Second Mrs. de Winter Syndrome. \u201cWe see marriages where the new couple is burdened psychologically living in the same apartment that had been occupied by the former spouse,\u201d Ms. Fisher said. \u201cIt\u2019s a burden, especially for a second wife. To get out of the shadow of someone\u2019s stakehold in a particular neighborhood is very empowering.\u201d         \n\nMs. Fisher has also known of cancer patients who abandon a longtime address for a home in a newly built development. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more beneficial and promising,\u201d she said, \u201cthan deciding, \u2018Not only am I going to survive; I\u2019m going to triumph; I am going to live in a fresh new environment.\u2019 They\u2019re using real estate to make a therapeutic \u2014 positive \u2014 bet on the future.\u201d         \n\nTwo years ago, Matt Holbein was grieving for his partner\u2019s father, who had just died, an event that hit the couple very hard.         \n\n\u201cHe was like  \n father, too,\u201d said Mr. Holbein, 44, a vice president of Douglas Elliman. Soon afterward, he and his partner began a trial separation that quickly became \u201ca pretty dramatic breakup,\u201d Mr. Holbein said. \u201cIt was very painful, and we dealt with it in very different ways.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/realestate/relocation-therapy.html", "date": "2013-01-04", "description": "There are events in life \u2014 a breakup, a death, an illness \u2014 that make a change of address good medicine, wrenching and expensive as it may be.
