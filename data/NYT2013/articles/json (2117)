{"headline": "Memories of Home, and a Huge Thanksgiving Latke", "body": "\nAfter living in what must have seemed like every neighborhood in three boroughs \u2014 Coney Island, the South Bronx, East Flatbush, Spanish Harlem (as it was then called), the Lower East Side \u2014 my mother\u2019s parents, in their oldish age, settled in Astoria, which is where I spent almost all the Thanksgivings of my childhood.         \n\nWith the odd exception of 1963, when the mood was awful but the weather glorious,  \n was always (in my memory) gray and blustery. My grandmother\u2019s kitchen was steamy. She roasted, she saut\u00e9ed, she fried, she boiled and she kvetched. She produced, almost solo, the traditionally ridiculous abundance of food, including my favorite, the potato nik, a huge latke fried in chicken fat until really brown, and as crisp as perfectly done shoestring fries. I still make this, and so can you.         \n\nYou can also make \u2014 perhaps not Thursday, but surely beginning on Friday, with Wylie Dufresne\u2019s leftover turkey hash \u2014 this lovely variety of dishes produced by a bevy of my favorite chefs, including April Bloomfield, Danny Bowien, Claudia Fleming and Andr\u00e9 Soltner. Your Thanksgiving may be happier in anticipation of cooking these; I hope so.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/27/dining/memories-of-home-and-a-huge-thanksgiving-latke.html", "date": "2013-11-22", "description": "An enormous potato latke evokes the spirit of Thanksgiving."}
