{"headline": "We Were Joy Division", "body": "\nIt all started with the Sex Pistols. I saw them twice in 1976 \u2014 two gigs weeks apart at the Lesser Free Trade Hall in Manchester \u2014 Bernard Sumner (our guitarist) and I went together with a couple of friends to the first gig, and at the second gig I bumped into Ian Curtis, who would become our lead singer. They were only on for half an hour, but when they finished, we filed out quietly with our minds blown, absolutely utterly speechless, and it just sort of dawned on me then \u2014 that was it. On the way home that night we decided to form a band \u2014 Joy Division. The name was Ian\u2019s idea.         \n\nBy 1979, we hadn\u2019t yet even made an album, but because we were being so productive, talk turned to making one. To be perfectly frank, we weren\u2019t that fussy about whom we made it with. But in the meantime Martin Rushent invited us down to the studio to record some demos, just to see if we were going to jell. He\u2019d produced the Buzzcocks and the Stranglers by this point, so we were very excited by the prospect.         \n\nWhen we got there, we saw that Rushent had a brand-new Jaguar XJS \u2014 and as it happened I\u2019d been reading this article about how something like 9 out of 10 Jag owners don\u2019t lock the boot of their car. So I thought, I wonder if that\u2019s true. . . . Tried his boot and, lo and behold, it was unlocked. Inside, it was full of what I\u2019m sure were stolen car radios; you could tell they were stolen by the way the wires were dangling off from where they\u2019d been ripped out. Me and Terry, our roadie, were looking at each other, thinking, Martin\u2019s got a boot full of stolen car radios. And then, Wonder if he\u2019d miss a couple. . . .         \n\nAll day, whenever there was a break in the recording, we\u2019d be daring one another to go back in his boot and nick one each for our cars \u2014 because they were proper high-end stereos \u2014 but I was going: \u201cOh, no, we can\u2019t, because he might be our record company. We can\u2019t nick cassette players off our record company.\u201d We didn\u2019t take any. God knows what he was doing with them, though. We never asked him.         \n\nIt was a really nice studio, and he worked well with Ian on the vocals, did a few overdubs and stuff, nothing wild, very low key. The tracks were \u201cGlass,\u201d \u201cTransmission,\u201d \u201cIce Age,\u201d \u201cInsight\u201d and \u201cDigital.\u201d Rushent was a nice guy; we got on well.         \n\nThat was the thing about Joy Division, though: writing the songs was dead easy because the group was really balanced. We had a great guitarist, a great drummer, a great bass player and a great singer. Ian would listen to us jamming and then direct the song until it was . . . a song. He stood there like a conductor and picked out the best bits. Which was why, when he killed himself a year later, it made everything so difficult. It was like driving a great car that had only three wheels. The loss of Ian opened up a hole in us, and we had to learn to write in a different way. We were so tight, as a group, we didn\u2019t even use a tape recorder half the time. Didn\u2019t need one.         \n\nBack then we didn\u2019t know rules or theory. We had our ear, Ian, who listened and picked out the melodies. Then at some point his lyrics would appear. He always had these scraps of paper that he\u2019d written things down on, and he\u2019d go through his plastic bag. \u201cOh, I\u2019ve got something that might suit that.\u201d And the next thing you knew he\u2019d be standing there with a piece of paper in one hand, wrapped around the microphone stand, with his head down, making the melodies work. We\u2019d never hear what he was singing about in rehearsal because the equipment was so terrible. In his case it didn\u2019t matter because he delivered the vocal with such a huge amount of passion and aggression, as if he really meant it.         \n\nI recently got offered the tape of that session with Rushent. Eden Studios was taken over by a firm of solicitors, and left in a storeroom, hidden in the bowels of it, were the Joy Division masters. One of the staff members claimed to have them and offered me the tape through a third party. He wanted \u00a350,000 for it. This was in 2006 or something. Even then there was no way on earth you could make a record and hope to recoup 50 grand. I offered him a finder\u2019s fee, two grand, but he said no, and I\u2019ve never heard from him since; it\u2019s never appeared. Ah, well. It\u2019s a funny thing, people trying to sell you back bits of your own past. But I\u2019m getting used to it, to be honest.
