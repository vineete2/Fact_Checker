{"headline": "Discussing Chocolate With the Mast Brothers", "body": "\n \n         \n\nRick and Michael Mast, bearded food-loving brothers from Primghar, Iowa, may look more like prairie settlers than urban food pioneers. But  \n, made in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, since 2007, has been on the cutting edge of the craft food movement since the start.         \n\nTheir new book, \u201cMast Brothers Chocolate: A Family Cookbook,\u201d is filled with chocolate-centric recipes, as simple as chocolate milk, as complex as cocoa coq au vin. But it also illustrates how something as basic as a chocolate bar can become a culinary obsession, until one day you find yourself on the Brooklyn waterfront, unloading a three-masted schooner that arrived under sail and loaded with cacao pods from the Dominican Republic, as the brothers did in 2011.         \n\nThe Mast Brothers\u2019 intensely flavored chocolate is made only from cacao pods and cane sugar, which may not seem so impressive until you read the long ingredients lists on other bars: lecithin, milk solids, palm oil.         \n\nExactly how those leathery, football-sized cacao pods, filled with cocoa butter and a hard, bitter seed at the center, are transformed into chocolate bars and then chocolate desserts at restaurants like Per Se and Le Bernardin, will be the topic for this month\u2019s Recipe Lab. Laurie Jon Moran, the pastry chef at Le Bernardin, will be joining the conversation, and so will a New York Times reader: Jess Simpson, 27, a special education teacher from Austin, Tex., and the author of the food blog  \n.         \n\nReturn here on Thursday to watch the live conversation about chocolate; you can tweet any questions for the Mast Brothers to  \n. And if you try this recipe for chocolate caramels, be sure to tell us about it by posting a comment.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n1 pound (4 sticks) unsalted butter, plus more for greasing pan         \n\n1 1/4 cups heavy cream         \n\n2 cups sugar         \n\n5 ounces dark chocolate (at least 70 percent cacao solids), broken into pieces         \n\n1 teaspoon flaky sea salt, such as Maldon         \n\n1. Butter an 8-inch square pan and line with parchment paper or aluminum foil, leaving an extra inch or two hanging over the sides.         \n\n2. In a saucepan, heat cream and butter until melted.         \n\n3. Make the caramel: Pour sugar into a large saucepan fitted with a candy thermometer (or use an instant-read model). Over medium heat, heat sugar until edges begin to melt and turn brown. Using a wooden or silicone spoon, drag melted edges in towards the center of the pot to redistribute the heat. Continue to melt sugar, stirring gently to break up clumps, to 300 degrees; it will be dark brown, bubbling and clear. This will take about 10 minutes.         \n\n4. Immediately pour cream-butter mixture through a strainer into caramel: it will bubble wildly. Heat the mixture over medium-high heat to 260 degrees; this will take about 10 minutes.         \n\n5. Reduce heat to very low, add chocolate, and stir until melted and smooth.         \n\n6. Pour mixture into lined pan and let cool 15 minutes. Sprinkle salt on top. Let cool at room temperature until firm about 3 hours or overnight. (If weather is hot and humid, chill in refrigerator.)         \n\n7. When cool and firm, use paper to lift caramel slab out of pan. Using a large sharp knife and a ruler, cut into small squares, about 3/4-inch. Refrigerated caramel will need to soften slightly at room temperature before cutting.
