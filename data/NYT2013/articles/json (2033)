{"headline": "Presumed Innocent, but Caged in Court", "body": "\nMOSCOW \u2014 Under the Russian Constitution, Pavel V. Dmitrichenko, the star dancer charged with arranging  \n, is innocent until proven guilty. But in court, Mr. Dmitrichenko sits in a locked iron cage, guarded by security officers and, at times, a nasty-looking dog.         \n\nA similar scene played out this month in Cairo, where the ousted Egyptian president,  \n, was corralled with other defendants in a meshed metal cage \u2014  \n. Mr. Morsi was defiant, refusing to wear the customary prison-issued white track suit, demanding a microphone to speak from the pen and denouncing the trial as illegitimate.         \n\nLong eschewed as prejudicial by American courts and by the International Criminal Court in The Hague, locked docks, either metal cells or enclosures made of glass or wood, are still common, not only in countries like  \n and  \n where the judicial systems often face international criticism, but also in many Western democracies, including Britain and France.         \n\nCritics say that keeping defendants locked up in court presumes guilt, hinders the defense and often has no basis in law, resulting instead from administrative rules. In Russia, it is standard for anyone held without bail, even those who pose little security risk, like the women from the punk band Pussy Riot,  \n after protesting at a church last year.         \n\n\u201cSometimes you can exchange two words through the cage if the security guard allows it, but very often the cage is far away,\u201d said Sergei E. Kadyrov, one of Mr. Dmitrichenko\u2019s lawyers. \u201cIt\u2019s a serious obstacle to maintaining equal rights in the courtroom.\u201d         \n\nThe practice is coming under new scrutiny by legal experts and rights advocates, who say the potential harm \u2014 not only to defendants, but also to the judicial process in general \u2014 has multiplied now that court proceedings are often broadcast live, around the world on the Internet.         \n\nThe way defendants are portrayed in court, especially in political cases, can influence judges, juries and global public opinion. Shrewd defendants like Mr. Morsi can also influence perception by turning the cage to their advantage, using it to heighten the sense of an overly aggressive, politically motivated prosecution.         \n\n\u201cI showed the Pussy Riot photos to my first-year law students; it\u2019s a global audience we are talking about these days, with YouTube and the Web,\u201d said Linda Mulcahy, a law professor at the London School of Economics. \u201cAs soon as you put somebody in a cage, you begin to make the process part of the punishment.\u201d         \n\nOfficials often cite security concerns for using docks, either the risk that violent suspects pose to others, or the danger to defendants from potentially hostile spectators. Supporters say that when docks are used routinely, they do not attract notice or prejudice against defendants, but are crucial to safety.         \n\n\u201cPeople who committed various crimes \u2014 murder, rape, robberies, stabbings, shootings \u2014 are sitting five to 10 feet away from us,\u201d said Rick Woodburn, the president of the Canadian Association of Crown Counsel, which represents prosecutors in Canada, where docks are customary. \u201cI have seen numerous times where accused people got out of control and needed to be wrestled to the ground. I am not sure what that does to the presumption of innocence.\u201d         \n\nThe  \n has issued several rulings in recent years criticizing the use of locked docks as degrading or inhumane, including in Russia and in the former Soviet republics of Armenia, Moldova and Georgia. But the rulings did not bar docks entirely as a rights violation.         \n\nIn an initial  \n the human rights court went the furthest yet in censuring the practice under virtually any circumstance, siding with two men held in a cage while on trial for armed robbery, in the Russian Far East.         \n\nThe men, who were acquitted of the robbery charges, complained that they had been held like \u201cmonkeys in a zoo.\u201d The rights court found that there was no evidence \u201cgiving serious grounds for the fear that the applicants posed a danger to order and security in the courtroom, or would resort to violence or abscond.\u201d         \n\n\u201cTheir placement in the cage,\u201d the judges found, \u201cwas not justified.\u201d         \n\nRussia argued that the docks were a routine security measure required under rules for court construction set in the 1990s. It has appealed the decision, which imposed a fine of \u20ac7,500, about $10,000, per defendant.         \n\nAlthough there has been little research on the potential influence of locked docks on the verdicts reached by judges or juries, experts argue that defendants are clearly put at a disadvantage.         \n\n\u201cAll the evidence that we can collect suggests that it\u2019s prejudicial,\u201d said David Tait, a professor at the University of Western Sydney in Australia  \n.         \n\nCourts in France, England, Canada and much of Australia commonly place criminal defendants in docks made of wood or a combination of wood and glass. In England, docks are required to have side walls more than seven feet tall. Higher-security docks are often enclosed by glass up to the ceiling.
