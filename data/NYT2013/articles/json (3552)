{"headline": "For Pilot, a Detour on the Way Back", "body": "\nBROOKLINE, Mass. \u2014 Andy Aduddell was playing the best golf of his life 12 years ago when he showed up for a practice round before a tournament at his home course in Texas \u2014 and never hit a ball.         \n\nLike millions around the world, he was transfixed by television that day: Sept. 11, 2001. Golf had been his life to that point. He had had a successful college career at Texas Christian and Texas, where he once led a tournament field that included Tiger Woods. He was subsisting on mini-tours and state opens and was hoping to earn his PGA Tour card that fall.         \n\nBut the memories of Sept. 11 resonated. Three weeks later, he was leading a tournament in Lake Charles, La., after two rounds. The third round was delayed by rain. While he waited in his hotel room for the weather to break, Aduddell picked up the phone. He called an Air Force recruiter.         \n\n\u201cIt was the first time I had ever done anything like that,\u201d Aduddell said Monday after the first round of the United States Amateur Championship. \u201cA lot of people were deeply affected by that day. I wasn\u2019t that different from anyone else.\u201d         \n\nThe call to the Air Force recruiter led to his second act, as an F-16 fighter pilot and a major in the Air Force. Over the next decade, the training, the travel and his life in the military put a damper on his golf game. Aduddell played no competitive golf, teeing it up only for the occasional weekend round.         \n\nBut in 2012, while he was still in the Air Force, he began to play more regularly. His game returned in a hurry. He won the All-Armed Forces Championship against other servicemen last October. He received a sponsor\u2019s exemption into last year\u2019s Arizona Amateur and won that as well. He also won the Arizona Mid-Amateur.         \n\nAduddell then qualified for the United States Amateur for the fifth time \u2014 and first since 1996 \u2014 by winning medalist honors in a sectional qualifier in Litchfield Park, Ariz. Unfamiliar with the Country Club in Brookline, where the tournament began Monday, he and his wife, Rebecca, rented the movie \u201cThe Greatest Game Ever Played,\u201d which chronicles the improbable 1913  \n triumph of an amateur, Francis Ouimet, at the course.         \n\nAduddell, 38, opened the Amateur with a seven-over 77 on Monday, betrayed by a wayward putter on the venerable club\u2019s slick greens. He missed makable birdie putts on the 15th, 16th and 17th holes and closed by three-putting the 18th.         \n\n\u201cI think maybe I should try a cue stick,\u201d Aduddell said. \u201cIt\u2019s really disappointing. That is usually one of the strengths of my game. But I had 37 putts. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve done that before.\u201d         \n\nHe said that he still feels he can make it to match play; the low 64 scores out of 312 from two days of stroke play qualify. But even if he does not, he said he could appreciate the journey that took him and Rebecca, a law student at Arizona State, to greater Boston for the week.         \n\n\u201cGetting here was the experience,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything else is just gravy.\u201d         \n\nAduddell (pronounced A-dud-dle) is one of the elder statesmen in a tournament where the average competitor is 22. He was that kind of hot shot from 1993 to 1996, playing in four consecutive Amateurs. Back then, golf was his passion. Now his perspective has changed.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s 180 degrees different,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m enjoying this event a lot more. Golf was much more serious for me back then, and I see a lot of my old self in these kids out there.\u201d         \n\nThese days, he said, if he chooses to play a weekend round at his home club near Phoenix, his 2-year-old son, Brooks, demands to tag along. Brooks is spending this week in Corpus Christi, Tex., with his grandfather. On Monday, Rebecca Aduddell spent the round texting scores to her father-in-law.         \n\nAduddell met his wife while stationed at Shaw Air Force Base in Columbia, S.C. Rebecca was earning her master\u2019s degree in German from the University of South Carolina. They spent two years in South Korea before moving to Luke Air Force Base outside Phoenix.         \n\nIt is there that Aduddell learned to fly F-16s. Now his time is primarily spent instructing future F-16 pilots. His military commitment ends in nine months, and he said he had no idea what would come next.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re weighing our options,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I want to keep flying.\u201d         \n\nMore than 1,400 of Aduddell\u2019s 2,000 hours of flight time have been in F-16s. He has yet to fly a combat mission, however. He was scheduled to be deployed to Afghanistan, but the assignment never materialized.         \n\nAbout the same time, he received a phone call asking him if he wanted to play in a tournament in Peru. He finished fourth. Golf had re-entered Aduddell\u2019s life, not as the all-consuming game it once was, but as a pleasant and occasionally rewarding diversion from his day job.
