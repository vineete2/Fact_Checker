{"headline": "On Speed-Dial Before Speed-Dial", "body": "\nAn architect can claim exceptional good fortune to find a client loyal through two decades. Such was William Bunker Tubby, who enjoyed the patronage of the oil-rich family of Charles Pratt, and speckled  \n with picturesque, usually Richardsonian-Romanesque-style houses, schools and factories from the 1880s through the early 20th century. And thanks to one very unusual commission, Tubby took care of the Pratts even in the afterlife.         \n\nIn the 1870s Charles Pratt parlayed his successful kerosene and oil business into a partnership with John D. Rockefeller, and in 1891 The New York Tribune estimated his fortune at $20 million. He raised his eight children in a brick-and-brownstone mansion on Clinton Avenue in Fort Greene, and gradually acquired more land along the block, on which the family ultimately put up five mansions, including the 1895 Frederic B. Pratt House at No. 229 Clinton Avenue. This is now the residence of Dr. Thomas F. Schutte, the president of Pratt Institute, the college established by the Pratts in 1887.         \n\nWilliam B. Tubby was born in 1858 in Iowa. His father was Josiah Tubby, a civil engineer who soon moved to Brooklyn and became a successful leather merchant. The 1880 census recorded William Tubby as a clerk; probably he was working in the office of Ebenezer L. Roberts, at the time the favored Pratt architect, and the designer of Charles Pratt\u2019s Brooklyn house.         \n\nRoberts was succeeded by Lamb & Rich, experts in the picturesque, like the main building at the Pratt Institute, built in 1887. Two years later, Tubby took their place, first with a row of nifty little red-brick houses, 286-290 Vanderbilt Avenue, notable for their Queen Anne-style windows and the plum-colored terra-cotta voussoirs, the angled shapes forming the round arch of a window.         \n\nSuzanne Spellen, who writes the Building of the Day blog on  \n, counts these houses as the first of at least 36 collaborations between Tubby and the Pratts from 1889 to 1908.         \n\nTubby built the row houses for the Morris Building Company, a development arm of the Pratt family that supported its good works. The Pratts built solidly and well, since the goal was long-term income, not quick sale. At the turn of the century, the Morris Building Company generated $100,000 of the Pratt Institute\u2019s yearly budget of $250,000.         \n\nIn 1890, Tubby did nifty on a grand scale, with his house for Pratt\u2019s eldest son, Charles Millard Pratt, at 241 Clinton Avenue. Now the residence of the bishop of Brooklyn, this one has a witch\u2019s-hat tower, a luscious tile roof, a heavy-lidded eyebrow dormer and a great arched drive-through.         \n\nCharles Pratt the elder died in 1891, but Tubby continued to receive commissions from the Morris Building Company, including three soft-orange-brick row houses built in 1892 at 179-183 St. James Place. Tubby gave them strange slit windows on the top floor, as well as fantastical, sinuous door hardware and limestone door frames with a definite Prairie-style look.         \n\nTwo dozen commissions followed, including tamer 1894 row houses in the manner of the English architect Richard Norman Shaw at 129-135 Cambridge Place, and the brick-and-brownstone Pratt Library. He also designed a sumptuous, fortresslike stable for the Pratts at 261 Vanderbilt Avenue around 1890.         \n\nJust before Pratt died, he began accumulating land at Glen Cove, N.Y., on  \n, for a projected family compound that grew to 1,000 acres. My wife, Erin Drake Gray, a Pratt descendant and a preservationist, has researched the family\u2019s estates on Long Island, and believes that Tubby\u2019s houses there were all erased by later construction.         \n\nTubby\u2019s most spectacular work for the family in Glen Cove was a five-building stable compound built around a large oval, centered on an administrative building with a Flemish-style tower. Only the tower survives.         \n\nIn the 1900s, Tubby\u2019s Pratt commissions petered out, devolving to a 1904 set of garages at 187-195 Waverly Avenue \u2014 small potatoes, although with intricate brickwork. The children of Charles Pratt switched their allegiances to a variety of architects including Delano & Aldrich and Charles Platt. Tubby continued just fine without them, designing scores of buildings, especially in Greenwich, Conn., where he moved around 1910. He died there in 1944.         \n\nWhat was Tubby like? A photograph provided by his granddaughter Frances Chilcote of Laguna Beach, Calif., shows a lithe, suave man leaning at a rakish angle; he could be a successful novelist or a society artist. Mrs. Chilcote said that Tubby, a Quaker, \u201calways spoke to me as thee and thou.\u201d She describes him as \u201ca very gentle person\u201d who collected antiques. She still has his 16th-century \u201chen table\u201d with a compartment below for a chicken, and a chopping block on the top.         \n\nAs for his designs for the grave, Tubby\u2019s 1895 mausoleum for the Pratts is hidden away on a forested piece of land in Glen Cove. It has a cold, Romanesque-style exterior of granite, but a spectacular mosaic ceiling inside modeled after the tomb of Galla Placidia, built in Ravenna in the fifth century. Charles Pratt was the first to be interred there, and most of his children lie inside, the reflected light from the colorful tiles staining the marble floor.         \n\nThe Pratts evidently like to be neighbors in death as well as in life: descendants are buried in plots surrounding the mausoleum, and there is even space for spouses.
