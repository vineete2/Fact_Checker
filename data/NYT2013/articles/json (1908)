{"headline": "U.S. Ends Panama\u2019s World Cup Run and Saves Mexico", "body": "\nIt was the perfect end to a bizarre day of World Cup qualifying: the United States saved Mexico.         \n\nThe longtime rivals rarely do anything to help the other out, but on Tuesday there was no mistaking what took place. Mexico, which has struggled throughout the Concacaf qualifying tournament, was just minutes away from losing to Costa Rica, 2-1, and failing to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1982. El Tri\u2019s only hope was that the United States, which was losing to Panama at the time, would somehow rally for at least a tie.         \n\nThe United States did even better, scoring two late goals to beat Panama, 3-2. The result knocked the Panamanians out and gave Mexico an unexpected \u2014 and some might say undeserved \u2014 reprieve. Mexico, which has won just 2 of its 10 qualifiers and is on its third coach of the cycle, will now face New Zealand in a two-game playoff for a place at the World Cup next summer in Brazil. The United States clinched its place last month after beating Mexico in Columbus, Ohio.         \n\nThe United States, without many of its top players, had little to play for but was game for most of the match and tied the score, 1-1, in the 63rd\u00a0minute \u2014 a development that coincided almost exactly with Costa Rica taking the lead on Mexico in its game.         \n\nUndeterred, Panama bounced back to reclaim the lead in the 83rd\u00a0minute and looked set to go through to the playoff, only to collapse in the final seconds, allowing Graham Zusi to score in the second minute of added time and Aron Johannsson to score a minute later to complete the turnaround for the United States and, for at least this night, its biggest rival, too.         \n\nEarlier in the day, another nation\u2019s World Cup hopes were almost certainly dashed.         \n\nBob Bradley, the former coach of the United States national team, had another World Cup dream punctured by Ghana on Tuesday as the Black Stars blasted Bradley\u2019s current squad, Egypt, in the first leg of Africa\u2019s qualifying tournament playoffs.         \n\nThe 6-1 score was a fair representation of a game in which Egypt was dominated. Bradley and the United States were bounced from the World Cup in 2010 by Ghana, though at least that Round of 16 match had some drama to it; Tuesday\u2019s defeat did not. Asamoah Gyan, who also scored the decisive goal for Ghana against the Americans, scored twice Tuesday, and the host Black Stars ran away in the second half.         \n\nTechnically, the Egyptians are still alive, but they will need to overcome a five-goal deficit in the second leg of the playoff on Nov. 19 in Cairo. Even Bradley conceded the outlook was bleak.         \n\n\u201cOur dream of qualifying for the World Cup has become nearly impossible,\u201d he said at a postmatch news conference, according to Egyptian news media.         \n\nThe seemingly inevitable elimination is a harsh ending to Bradley\u2019s time in Egypt. Bradley, a New Jersey native, had been cast as an uplifting figure during a time of strife in Egypt, which was rocked by the Arab Spring as well as the riot in Port Said in which 74 soccer fans were killed at an Egyptian league match.         \n\nDespite the unrest around him, Bradley led Egypt to a 6-0-0 record in the group stage, only to stumble, again, against Ghana.         \n\n\u201cI apologize to the Egyptian people for Tuesday\u2019s loss,\u201d Bradley said at his news conference. \u201cI know that reaching the World Cup is the dream of all Egyptians, but I failed to realize that dream.\u201d         \n\nIt was not the only stunning result on a predictably wild day of qualifying matches around the world. Bosnia and Herzegovina clinched its first World Cup spot; Iceland advanced to the European playoffs in its effort to become the smallest nation to compete in a World Cup; and England avoided disaster by beating Poland at Wembley Stadium to assure its place in Brazil with minimal fuss.         \n\nEngland struggled at times during qualifying under Manager Roy Hodgson, but the team delivered when it mattered most, beating Montenegro on Friday before dispatching Poland on Tuesday behind goals from Wayne Rooney and the captain, Steven Gerrard.         \n\nAfterward, Hodgson said he was nervous throughout the match, which longtime England fans had rued as a possible tripwire because Poland spoiled England\u2019s bid for a place in the 1974 World Cup in a qualifying match at Wembley.         \n\n\u201cI died a thousand deaths every time they crossed the halfway line,\u201d Hodgson said at a news conference.         \n\nAsked about England\u2019s chances in Brazil, he said: \u201cYou always have a chance. If you want to win the lottery buy a ticket. And we have a ticket.\u201d         \n\nWhile England managed to dodge the often-treacherous European playoffs, as did Spain and Russia, other established soccer powers were not so fortunate. France, Portugal and Croatia are among the eight runners-up in their groups that now face a two-game aggregate playoff to earn a World Cup berth. The draw for the playoffs will be Monday, with the games scheduled for November.         \n\nIn South America, there was little drama on the final qualifying day. Uruguay had an outside chance to gain an automatic qualifying spot if it beat Argentina, and the Chile-Ecuador game was lopsided. Though Uruguay did its part, winning, 3-2, Chile beat Ecuador by only 2-1, ensuring both teams qualified.         \n\nUruguay will now need to win a two-match playoff with Jordan if it hopes to join those two teams, and Argentina and Colombia, in Brazil next year.
