{"headline": "Hopis Try to Stop Paris Sale of Artifacts", "body": "\nIn a rare case of a cultural heritage claim arising from the sale of American artifacts abroad, the Hopi Indians of Arizona have asked federal officials to help stop a high-price auction of 70 sacred masks in Paris next week.         \n\nThe tribe is receiving advice from the State and Interior Departments, but each agency says its ability to intervene is limited.         \n\nIn many ways, the Hopi case illustrates a paradox in the way artifacts are repatriated around the world.         \n\nWhile foreign nations routinely rely on international accords to secure American help in retrieving antiquities from the United States, Washington has no reciprocal agreements governing American artifacts abroad. And the United States laws that provide some protection against the illicit sale of Indian artifacts in this country have no weight in foreign lands. So tribes reaching overseas to recover objects that they view as culturally important are left to do battle on their own.         \n\n\u201cRight now there just aren\u2019t any prohibitions against this kind of large foreign sale,\u201d said Jack F. Trope, executive director of the Association on American Indian Affairs, which is seeking new laws and treaties that would give the United States more force to intervene. \u201cThe leverage for international repatriation just isn\u2019t there.\u201d         \n\nThe Hopis, who number about 18,000 in northeast Arizona, regard the objects in the Paris sale, which they call Katsinam, or \u201cfriends,\u201d as imbued with divine spirits. They object to calling them \u201cmasks\u201d and say that outsiders who photograph, collect or sell them are committing sacrilege. The brightly colored visages and headdresses, often adorned with horsehair, sheepskin, feathers and maize, are thought to embody the spirits of warriors, animals, messengers, fire, rain and clouds, among other things. They are used today, as in the past, in many Hopi rites, like coming-of-age ceremonies and harvest rituals.         \n\nThe N\u00e9ret-Minet auction house in Paris says that its  \n, will be one of the largest auctions of Hopi artifacts ever, and it estimates that it will bring in $1 million. Many of the objects are more than 100 years old and carry estimates of $10,000 to $35,000. The auction house says that among the spirits represented are the Crow Mother, the Little Fire God and the Mud Head Clown.         \n\n\u201cSacred items like this should not have a commercial value,\u201d said Leigh J. Kuwanwisiwma, director of the \n in Kykotsmovi, Ariz. \u201cThe bottom line is we believe they were taken illegally.\u201d         \n\nThe auction house says that a collector who has not been identified legally bought the items in the United States at sales and auctions over 30 years, beginning in the 1930s, and that the coming auction complies with French law.         \n\n\u201cThis sale is not just a business transaction but a homage to the Hopi Indians,\u201d said Gilles N\u00e9ret-Minet, the director of the house.         \n\nHistorians say many Hopi artifacts were taken long ago by people who found them unattended in shrines and on altars along the mesas of the Southwest. Others were confiscated by missionaries who came to convert the tribe in the late 19th century. Some were sold by tribe members. But even those sales were not legitimate, Hopi leaders say, because they may have been made under duress, and because the tribe holds that an individual cannot hold title to its religious artifacts \u2014 they are owned communally.         \n\nThe market for American Indian artifacts, both here and abroad, is robust, experts say, and auctions of Indian items in the United States typically proceed unimpeded by American law and unchallenged by most tribes. There are some protections, though, under United States theft statutes, experts say, as well as restrictions on the sale of pieces by museums and federal agencies.         \n\nThe Hopis and their supporters say the Paris sale is especially objectionable because of its size and the religious significance of the items involved. They say it also illustrates a striking disparity between what the government is empowered to do to help a foreign country recover an object from the United States and its inability to do much to retrieve an American artifact for sale overseas.
