{"headline": "Christie Assails Libertarian Shift on National Security by Some in the G.O.P.", "body": "\nASPEN, Colo. \u2014 Conservatives have many reasons to be suspicious of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey. He embraced President Obama after Hurricane Sandy in the final days of the 2012 race. He is a Northeasterner in a Southern-dominated party. And he has taken positions on issues like guns that unsettle the political right.         \n\nSo when Mr. Christie appeared before a group of major donors and party enthusiasts here on Thursday evening, he seized on a subject that provides him a rare opportunity to take a rightward stance, offering a tough-talking hawkish denunciation of the Republican drift toward national security libertarianism.         \n\nThe governor invoked the Sept. 11 attacks to criticize those who, like Senator Rand Paul, the Kentucky Republican who is a potential rival for the 2016 presidential nomination, have questioned whether government surveillance efforts have trampled on civil liberties.         \n\n\u201cThese esoteric, intellectual debates \u2014 I want them to come to New Jersey and sit across from the widows and the orphans and have that conversation,\u201d Mr. Christie said. \u201cAnd they won\u2019t, because that\u2019s a much tougher conversation to have.\u201d         \n\nMr. Christie warned that those advocating a crackdown on the  \n, instituted under President George W. Bush and now being carried out under Mr. Obama, would regret it.         \n\n\u201cThe next attack that comes, that kills thousands of Americans as a result, people are going to be looking back on the people having this intellectual debate and wondering whether they put \u2014\u201d Mr. Christie said before cutting himself off.         \n\nHis blunt and seemingly off-the-cuff comments at the end of an hourlong panel with three other Republican governors at the Aspen Institute provided a vivid reminder of why he has so rapidly become a national figure and leading 2016 contender. His remarks quickly found their way to Twitter and by Friday morning had become the talk of the political class, with Mr. Paul\u2019s advisers swatting back.         \n\nEven before his swipe at Mr. Paul, Mr. Christie dominated the stage, mixing pugnacity, brio and wit to such effect that toward the end of the program Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana pointed in Mr. Christie\u2019s direction to praise \u201cleadership like frankly you see here.\u201d         \n\nThe audience was enthralled. They laughed at his jokes, applauded his blunt-force assessments of Mr. Obama and gazed at him solemnly when he spoke of the losses of Sept. 11. The scene, as he fired off line after line, recalled the town hall performances that vaulted him to political fame only three years ago.         \n\nBut the same skills that have won him so much support in a largely Democratic state \u2014 authenticity and an easy, occasionally eloquent improvisational style \u2014 could bring more mixed results if he seeks his party\u2019s nomination for president in a grueling process that brings endless scrutiny and demands discipline. Consider the reaction from his appearance on Thursday: While the governor\u2019s comments clearly resonated with the audience and, according to his aides, drew favorable feedback among hawkish Republicans elsewhere, they drew criticism from beyond the ranks of Mr. Paul\u2019s loyalists.         \n\nSome suggested the governor was gratuitously provocative in citing the Sept. 11 attacks as he waded into a nuanced area of civil liberties versus national security. Others wondered, not for the first time, whether Mr. Christie was so fond of an audience\u2019s embrace that he could not resist such dramatic utterances.         \n\n\u201cLike a drone strike, he came at the question from miles above the ground,\u201d wrote conservative commentator Ramesh Ponnuru of the National Review and Bloomberg News. \u201cUnlike the military, he used no precision targeting.\u201d         \n\nParty activists, Mr. Ponnuru said, need to see that Mr. Christie \u201cis capable of a little finesse, especially when it comes to managing the Republican coalition.\u201d         \n\nThese are not the words of a conservative purist opposed to the idea of Mr. Christie becoming president. In the new issue of National Review, Mr. Ponnuru compared Mr. Christie favorably with the party\u2019s last two more moderate standard-bearers and said the governor \u201cwill seem like the answer to many Republicans\u2019 prayers\u201d if he wins big this fall.         \n\nStill, others noted that even as Mr. Christie criticized Mr. Paul, he indulged in one of his habits that most irritates Republicans: offering praise, direct and indirect, of Mr. Obama.         \n\n\u201cPresident Obama has done nothing to change the policies of the Bush administration in the war on terrorism. And I mean practically nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you know why? \u2019Cause they work.\u201d         \n\nMr. Christie leavened his praise of Mr. Obama on national security with applause-drawing shots at the president\u2019s health care overhaul and his failure to build relationships with Republicans.         \n\nBut even as he did so, the governor wandered into touchier territory within the party, offering a critique of Congressional gerrymandering, which he called a barrier to bipartisanship. And, when asked about illegal immigrants, he declared that \u201cthe simple fact is they\u2019re not leaving\u201d and added that Republicans would never attract minority voters if they did not end the kind of \u201cdivisive and destructive\u201d rhetoric as that of Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, who recently said that many young Mexican immigrants had carried drugs across the border.         \n\nAll told, Mr. Christie ventured into far riskier territory than the others on the panel \u2014 Mr. Pence; Bobby Jindal, the governor of Louisiana; and Scott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin \u2014 combined.         \n\nThis type of blunt talk is, party insiders say, what makes him fresh, interesting and appealing to a broad audience.         \n\nBut it also presents a danger for Mr. Christie going into 2016: Conservatives tend to recoil at those Republican figures who become in-house critics, especially those who are media favorites. Jon Huntsman faced that dynamic during his failed 2012 presidential campaign.         \n\nThat is not to compare the two. Mr. Christie would come to a Republican race with far more strengths, though perhaps his most significant one \u2014 his frankness \u2014 can sometimes double as a liability. But he professes not to care.         \n\n\u201cThe problem with politicians,\u201d he said during one of his riffs here, is \u201cthey try to be everything to everybody.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/27/us/politics/christie-cites-9-11-in-assailing-libertarian-trend-in-gop.html", "date": "2013-07-26", "description": "Remarks by the New Jersey governor provided a vivid reminder of why he has so become a national figure and leading 2016 contender for the Republican presidential nomination."}
