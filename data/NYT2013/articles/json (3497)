{"headline": "On the Enduring Appeal of \u2018Die Hard\u2019", "body": "\nWith the release of \u201cA Good Day to Die Hard,\u201d the fifth film in the \u201cDie Hard\u201d series, the cinematic life span of John McClane has been elongated to a robust 10 hours \u2014 longer than sturdy pop icons like Ellen Ripley, Indiana Jones and John Rambo (four films each) and Michael Corleone (three films and nine hours). Once you add in the fact that McClane has appeared on-screen in four different decades, he\u2019s arguably the most durable contemporary American film character not named Batman or Rocky Balboa.         \n\nThanks to multiple rewatchings of every \u201cDie Hard\u201d film, I personally have spent many more than 10 hours in McClane\u2019s company. I\u2019m embarrassed to admit \u2014 though probably not nearly as embarrassed as I should be \u2014 that I\u2019ve spent more time watching, contemplating and analyzing John McClane than I have, say, Hamlet. I don\u2019t say this lightly. This devotion confuses me. (Not my devotion to the original \u201cDie Hard\u201d \u2014 that film could be playing on a staticky video screen in a sauna full of lava and piranhas in hell and, should I happen to pass by, I would sit down and watch it to the end.) Rather, it\u2019s my devotion to the character.         \n\nA character like Rocky I totally understand. Rocky\u2019s the underdog. Batman? He\u2019s the haunted vigilante: the hero we deserve but not the hero we need right now, as Commissioner Gordon once put it. (Who then is the hero we need right now but not the hero we deserve? Aquaman?) And Hamlet. He\u2019s melancholy. I get that. But who exactly is John McClane?         \n\nSure, he has his catchphrase (\u201cYippee-ki-yay\u201d et cetera), his quips, his bloodied brow and his sleeveless tees. (In the third movie, \u201cDie Hard: With a Vengeance,\u201d McClane shows up in his first scene wearing only his trademark undershirt and no explanations are offered or needed, any more than anyone at this point asks Superman to explain his cape.) But what does McClane stand for? What is he an icon of? Unlike Rocky or Batman (or Hamlet), McClane is tricky to pin down. Or perhaps it\u2019s my affection for McClane that\u2019s tricky. Who is this man I\u2019ve spent 25 years with \u2014 whom I met as a teenager and still hang out with in my 40s? Yes, he has his Everyman appeal. But who among us really aspires to be an Everyman? For Pete\u2019s sake, I\u2019m already an Everyman.         \n\n \n first one, I don\u2019t even especially like the \u201cDie Hard\u201d movies. The second one\u2019s not so good. The third one is pretty good. The fourth one is slightly better, especially if you happen to catch it on a plane or FX. The fifth one \u2014 well, the fifth one just came out and let\u2019s just say it\u2019s less a coherent movie than it is a snuff film for cars and helicopters.         \n\nIt\u2019s difficult to evaluate the \u201cDie Hard\u201d series as a whole, however, because, by all logic, none of these sequels should exist. With \u201cRocky,\u201d each installment makes narrative sense: he\u2019s a fighter, so it follows that there should be more fights. But the very premise of the original \u201cDie Hard\u201d precludes continuation. That\u2019s part of the genius of the film. It completely flips the standard action-movie narrative, in which some world-class expert (the gunslinger; the safecracker; the ex-Green Beret) is lured out of hiding to tackle one last mission, to slay one last unslayable foe. The premise of \u201cDie Hard\u201d is that a regular New York cop is stuck unexpectedly in a building full of bad guys. The idea that this same guy finds himself in the same situation again \u2014 that stretches credulity.         \n\nOf course, in Hollywood, credulity bows to \u2014 nay, is the manservant of \u2014 profitability, which is how we ended up with \u201cDie Hard 2,\u201d with its memorable tagline, \u201cDie Harder.\u201d In this film, McClane is trapped in an airport that has been taken over by rogue American soldiers, and he constantly wonders aloud how the same thing could happen to the same guy twice, which exactly echoes the reservations of the audience.         \n\nFor the third, fourth and now fifth films, the producers wisely ditched the \u201cDie Hard\u201d trapped-in-a-blankety-blank constraint (had they not, we would most likely be watching \u201cDie Hard in the Center of the Earth\u201d at this point), which both freed the franchise but also sent it spiraling toward the black hole of generic action-adventure. It\u2019s important to remember, as action heroes go, just how radical McClane seemed in 1988. He arrived in the shadow of Schwarzenegger\u2019s Teutonic (and, in \u201cThe Terminator,\u201d literally robotic) unstoppability and the hoo-rah fantasy of Rambo leaping up from a river to cut down entire armies with bow and arrows. The quintessential scene in the first \u201cDie Hard\u201d is one in which McClane is pinned down in an office cubicle, and Hans Gruber, noticing McClane\u2019s unshod feet, instructs his sidekick to \u201c \n\u201d \u2014 shoot the glass. Cut to McClane hobbling and trailing great globs of blood into a bathroom, then prying shards from his sliced-up soles. By contrast, the quintessential scene in the most recent James Bond film, \u201cSkyfall,\u201d occurs when Bond jumps onto the ripped-open backside of a moving train car, then pauses to adjust his cuff links.
