{"headline": "Rodriguez Denies Implicating Others", "body": "\nBOSTON \u2014 Alex Rodriguez arrived at Fenway Park on Friday to begin a three-game series against the Red Sox, bracing for an extended chorus of derision from Red Sox fans getting their first crack at him since baseball suspended him for 211 games. The punishment came after he was linked to a South Florida clinic that supplied players with performance-enhancing drugs.         \n\nBut even before he stepped onto the field and listened to the first catcalls of the weekend, he was already confronting more controversy. This time, the CBS news program \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d citing two unnamed sources, reported that associates of Rodriguez had leaked information tying other players to the anti-aging clinic at the heart of baseball\u2019s recent drug investigations.         \n\n \n said that the associates provided documents to Yahoo Sports in February implicating Ryan Braun of the Milwaukee Brewers as well as Francisco Cervelli, one of Rodriguez\u2019s teammates on the Yankees. Braun, a former National League most valuable player, and Cervelli were among 13 players who recently accepted suspensions levied by baseball stemming from their connections to the clinic, Biogenesis.         \n\nRodriguez denied the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d report and said he told Cervelli as much.         \n\n\u201cI spoke to Cervelli this morning,\u201d Rodriguez said while sitting in the visitors\u2019 dugout before a crowd of reporters and photographers. \u201cHad a positive conversation. He understands it\u2019s not true, and we\u2019re on the same page.\u201d         \n\nRodriguez is the one player who is appealing his suspension, which at 211 games is more than twice the length of any of the suspensions issued to the other 13 players. He continues to be in the Yankees\u2019 lineup while his appeal plays out. Now, in the wake of the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d report, he will have to deal with the notion, accurate or inaccurate, that he was willing to point the finger at other players, perhaps to divert attention from his own Biogenesis problems.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to change anything in here,\u201d Yankees outfielder Vernon Wells said, adding, \u201cI\u2019ve always taken the stance that he has nothing to explain to me.\u201d         \n\nRodriguez has long been aware that there are baseball fans who share a distaste for him. But he seemed stung by the implication that he would sell out fellow members of the players union, and he was at pains to declare his innocence.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a member of this union for 20 years,\u201d he said, \u201cand it\u2019s important for all the guys to understand that my loyalty is to this union and it would never happen and never occur and it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d         \n\nRodriguez\u2019s appeal of the 211-game suspension will be heard by Fredric Horowitz. Michael Weiner, the leader of the players union, has said he does not expect the appeal to be heard until after the season.         \n\nDavid Cornwell, the lawyer at the head of Rodriguez\u2019s legal team who will argue his appeal, also denied that anyone close to Rodriguez distributed incriminating information about other players to the news media.         \n\n\u201cThese allegations are untrue and are another attempt to harm Alex \u2014 this time by driving a wedge between him and other players in the league,\u201d Cornwell said in a statement. \u201cWhile Alex focuses on baseball and repeatedly states that he is going to respect the appeal process, the drumbeat of false allegations continue.         \n\n\u201cThese improper and viciously false leaks will not alter the fact that M.L.B. exceeded its authority under the J.D.A.,\u201d Cornwell said, referring to the joint drug agreement, \u201cand the 211-game suspension will not stand.\u201d         \n\nIf there was a leak implicating other players by associates of Rodriguez, it was not clear whether he would have authorized or even known about it. Cornwell, who is based in Atlanta, is one of a number of lawyers and consultants across the country who have been engaged by Rodriguez during the course of the Biogenesis investigation.         \n\nAt least six law firms, an investigative firm and two public-relations firms have advised Rodriguez on a multitude of legal and public-relations matters this year, including disputes with the Yankees over his readiness to return from hip surgery and a quadriceps strain, his involvement in the Biogenesis matter and the appeal of the suspension.
