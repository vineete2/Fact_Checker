{"headline": "The Plot Against Rock", "body": "\nAndy McCluskey and Paul Humphreys have devoted much of their artistic lives to a war on rock nostalgia, but when you\u2019re showing a first-time visitor around Liverpool, what can you do? You\u2019re obliged to end up at the Cavern Club, a not-completely-uncharming replica of the vaulted, subterranean bar where the pre-Fab Four honed their fabulousness.         \n\nThe attraction on this early Friday evening was a man in a tank top, who stood on the small stage murdering \u201cHere Comes the Sun\u201d with a piercingly loud acoustic guitar. \u201cThis,\u201d said McCluskey, as we took our pints of Guinness and sought shelter inside an archway, \u201cis what we were trying to save the world from.\u201d         \n\nJust across the road is another bar with a claim to musical history, a dismal spot called Eric\u2019s, where McCluskey and Humphreys performed for the first time, in 1978, as Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark. The headliner was an unknown group from nearby Manchester called Joy Division. McCluskey played bass; Humphreys was on synthesizer. The third member of the band was a tape player loaded with backing tracks, whom they called Winston.         \n\nThough Liverpool of that era had many bands that became legends \u2014 Echo and the Bunnymen, the Teardrop Explodes \u2014 there wasn\u2019t another one remotely like O.M.D. Inspired by the German group Kraftwerk, they played electronic music. They were oddballs, freaks.         \n\nThirty-five years later, O.M.D. still doesn\u2019t quite fit in. The genre they helped invent \u2014 file under \u201csynth pop\u201d \u2014 proved hugely popular through the 1980s but tended to be dismissed unfairly as a hollow, MTV-era fad. Making a comeback at this stage of their lives is about correcting that perception. But there\u2019s something else, too. The day after our outing in Liverpool, McCluskey showed me around his large, elegant house, pausing outside the bedrooms of his two children, empty since the year before last, when his estranged wife moved with them to her native San Diego. Getting back to O.M.D., and the easy compatibility he once shared with Humphreys, is part of another, more personal reclamation project.         \n\n \n a suburban village on the Wirral Peninsula, McCluskey and Humphreys, who are both 53, bonded over their shared revulsion of the \u201970s-era macho guitar rock their friends adored. They conducted sound experiments in Humphreys\u2019s mother\u2019s small house, using homemade instruments like the \u201ctuba phone,\u201d a five-foot-long cardboard cylinder with a microphone on one end. McCluskey owned a bass but barely knew how to play it. He was right-handed, but it was a left-handed model, because that one had been cheaper, so he played it upside down. Humphreys had electronic devices that he took apart and reassembled into things that made noise. Eventually he saved up enough to buy a synthesizer from a catalog his mother received in the mail.         \n\nEverything they did was improvised, unplanned, jerry-built, including the band\u2019s name, which was taken from a list of song ideas and lyrics McCluskey had scrawled on his bedroom wall. \u201cIf we had known we were going to be stuck with this stupid name for 35 years,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019d probably have given it more thought.\u201d         \n\nLittle is remembered about the first O.M.D. gig other than that turnout was low, maybe 30 people, and McCluskey was amazed to discover that Joy Division\u2019s singer, Ian Curtis, had an awkward dancing style similar to his own. From that inauspicious start, however, O.M.D. was emboldened to send a demo to Tony Wilson, the impresario of Manchester\u2019s Factory Records, of a song called \u201cElectricity,\u201d which McCluskey describes modestly (and accurately) as \u201creally just a faster version of \u2018Radio-Activity,\u2019 \u201d one of Kraftwerk\u2019s best-known compositions.         \n\nWilson, they heard, did not personally like the song, but his wife loved it, and so he agreed to put it out as a single. O.M.D. became instantly hot. After a gig in Blackpool, a major-label rep gave them an envelope, which McCluskey tore open in the van as they drove back and read by flashlight. \u201cIt\u2019s a seven-album deal,\u201d he announced. \u201cIt adds up to over a quarter of a million pounds.\u201d         \n\nIf it sounds like a young, unknown band ought to be wary of rushing into a seven-album deal, well, that would turn out to be right.
