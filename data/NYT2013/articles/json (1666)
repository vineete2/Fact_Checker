{"headline": "Eating in Iowa: Farm-Fresh, Fried and Frugal", "body": "\nThe lunch and dinner I enjoyed on a recent day in Iowa didn\u2019t belong on the same planet, let alone in the same state. The first was a sandwich of loose ground meat on a workaday hamburger bun slathered with melted cheese, ketchup and mustard, served in a drab old building underneath a parking garage. The second, served in a reconstructed barn surrounded by miles of corn, was polenta-stuffed zucchini with kale, eggplant and squash, the vegetables raised on site and the polenta made from corn ground just 50 miles away.         \n\nYet both meals were decidedly Iowan, and dismantled the illusion that in three days of cruising the state\u2019s two-lane highways I could somehow pithily define its food. Really, the only thing every meal \u2014 and I had about five a day \u2014 had in common was their prices. That polenta entree, by far the most elegantly presented of my month on the road, was just $13.         \n\nThe sandwich, meanwhile, was $3.60. Iowans may already know where it came from:  \n in Ottumwa, a modest meatpacking city of 25,000. Since 1936, the restaurant has sat in a squat, yellow box of a building; it didn\u2019t budge when a municipal parking garage was literally built over it. (If you follow a GPS there, you\u2019ll find yourself in the garage; otherwise cut down an alley off South Court Street.)         \n\nThe experience at the lunch counter feels very middle school cafeteria: a lunch lady look-alike takes your order and spoons loose ground beef \u2014 sloppy joe without the slop \u2014 onto a bun, slathers on extras, wraps it and hands it to you. (What, you wanted a plate?) It\u2019s a signature Iowa lunch, generically known as \u201ca loose meat sandwich.\u201d Here it was simply a Canteen.         \n\nThe Canteen is proof that if an expert combines fat, carbs, sugar and salt in just the right ratio, the result can be worth the calories and ensuing sluggishness. I augmented the coming lethargy by ordering a strawberry malt ($3.95), after being encouraged to do so by the visitors next to me, a couple from Georgia who had come up to Iowa to look at a used RV. (In Ottumwa, that counts as out-of-state tourism.)         \n\nFor that farm dinner, I headed 120 miles west (driving long distances burns calories, right?) to the 400-person town of Orient, or, more accurately, to the Henry A. Wallace Country Life Center ( \n) outside it. Never heard of it? Neither had I. Mr. Wallace, who was secretary of agriculture (and then vice president) under Franklin D. Roosevelt, was raised in the main house, now a gift shop; the center, in that reconstructed barn, is part of a nonprofit that promotes \u201clocal food, sustainable agriculture and civility.\u201d The restaurant, also housed in the barn, is only open on Fridays and some Saturdays. Whatever does not come from the farm itself comes from a producer somewhere in Iowa, I was told by my server, who dutifully provided all the sustainable-locavore-other-buzzword details \u2014 almost, but not quite, to  \n.         \n\nEverything was as fresh as the canteen sandwich was processed: a $7 \u201ccheese and relish plate\u201d had bursting cherry tomatoes, crisp cauliflower lightly marinated in vinegar, pickled beets, and a crumbly local Cheddar, then came the polenta-stuffed zucchini. Outside, farmland stretched to the horizon, inside, my wallet barely stretched at all \u2014 I was out $25, including tip.         \n\nDuring the rest of my sprint around the state I would continue to Ping-Pong between fatty gluttony and farm freshness.         \n\nMore gluttony: the pork tenderloin sandwich, which has spawned best-in-state competitions and the cleverly named  \n. Newcomers will laugh at the little bun haplessly trying to cover the enormous tenderloin, pounded into the irregular shapes that often resemble  \n. For my representative pork tenderloin sandwich, I decided on Goldie\u2019s Ice Cream Shoppe ( \n), an ice cream stand turned diner in Prairie City, whose $5.98 version won best of show in 2009 from the Iowa Pork Producers.         \n\nThe staff was gentle to a newcomer, explaining that the conventional toppings were pickle, raw onion, ketchup and mustard. Ketchup and mustard seemed heavy-handed, so I went for just pickles and onions to add a little pop. When the sandwich arrived, I struggled with its size \u2014 I had been given only a knife, not a fork. I gave the server a perplexed look. \u201cCut it in half,\u201d she said. I felt, and not for the first time on this trip, like a bumbling foreigner.         \n\nBack to lean and green: Fairfield, home to the  \n, which calls itself a \u201chome of consciousness-based education,\u201d has more than its share of vegetarian cafeterias and restaurants. I went to the  \n, near (but alas, not in) the campus\u2019s two golden domes. The vegetarian buffet ($7.50 a pound) yielded some saag paneer, a bean taco loaded with vegetables, some tasty artichoke lasagna and a piece of fresh peach blueberry pie.         \n\nIowa\u2019s farm-fresh side melds with its gluttonous side at the Des Moines Farmers Market ( \n), which takes over a chunk of the capital\u2019s downtown every Saturday morning, May through October. One minute I was dipping pretzel sticks into eight flavors of artisan goat cheese from  \n or enjoying herb lemonade (infused with rosemary, thyme, lemon balm and ginger) from Blue Gate Farm. I followed this up with something called \u201cBreakfast Ice Cream,\u201d offered at a dairy stand for $5: a server put glazed doughnut holes in a bowl, covered them with bacon ice cream and added crumbled bacon and maple syrup. Big mistake. Unlike the Canteen, this unholy combo of sugar, salt and grease did not come to an agreement.         \n\nI did find a truly harmonious greasy-locavore masterpiece, however, in Iowa City, just what you would expect from a college town in a farm state. Short\u2019s Burger and Shine ( \n) gets its black Angus beef for its long list of burgers from a farm 26 miles outside of town; its buns are baked locally and its 10 taps filled with Iowa craft beers. (Another option: its own bean-based burgers.)         \n\nAt the bar, I ordered a Gravity burger, with caramelized onions, bacon, tame green chili sauce and a swipe of jalape\u00f1o flavored cream cheese and buried under a load of fries for $9.49. After sampling several brews, I ended up with a pint of Golden Nugget I.P.A., and wish I could have stayed for more, but solo traveling means you are the permanent designated driver.         \n\nIndeed, I logged about 800 in-state miles in under four days. But Iowa turned out to be the most pleasant and picturesque of the states I\u2019ve driven through so far: It\u2019s not dead flat, at least not for long stretches; its gently sloping farmland reads like some sort of fantasy Americana: deep-green soy fields, wavy rows of corn (which I tried not to think of ending up as high fructose corn syrup), picturesque red barns and the occasional old could-be-haunted farmhouses.         \n\nI did miss the most famous house in Iowa: the \u201cAmerican Gothic\u201d house in Eldon, where the Pitchfork Pie Stand operates on summer weekends. I had planned a visit, but read on its Web site,  \n, that it would be closed the weekend I was in the state. It was probably for the best: the world may need more pie, but after three days of eating in Iowa, I sure didn\u2019t.
