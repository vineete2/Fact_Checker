{"headline": "Aimed at Ecology, Park Group\u2019s Letter Offends Some Jews", "body": "\nIt initially seemed like just an eco-friendly news release \u2014 a reminder to \u201cthe public\u201d not to throw bread into Prospect Park Lake because it is not healthy for geese and other waterfowl.         \n\nBut the message included a not-too-subtle hint that it was aimed for a narrower audience: \u201cAs  \n approaches, Prospect Park is reaching out to the public regarding the removal of chametz (e.g. bread and other leavened products) from the home.\u201d         \n\nThat language \u2014 and the implication that observant Jews were the ones causing problems by feeding the geese \u2014 has provoked an unexpected confusion and outrage from some Jewish leaders, including one who called the message \u201can affront\u201d and \u201ca disgrace.\u201d Several rabbis said they were simply puzzled by why such a release was necessary, since throwing bread into the water is not a pre-Passover custom and only a few Jews might have individually chosen to do so.         \n\n\u201cIt disrespects an entire community,\u201d said Gary Schlesinger, director of United Jewish Community Advocacy Relations and Enrichment, a social service organization for the Satmar Hasidim in Williamsburg. \u201cIt\u2019s not even permitted that way. You have to burn it, or give it away. You don\u2019t put it into a lake.\u201d         \n\nPaul Nelson, a spokesman for the  \n, the nonprofit organization that manages the park with the city and which sent out the letter, said that, the protestations notwithstanding, park workers over the years had indeed observed people, with \u201cthe best of intentions,\u201d throwing bread into the lake.         \n\n\u201cIt usually is several hundred over the few days before Passover starts and all around the lake,\u201d he said in an e-mail, adding: \u201cWhen asked, they said they were disposing of their bread products in preparation for Passover and thought they were doing a good thing by feeding it to the waterfowl.\u201d         \n\nThis causes problems because bread can divert waterfowl from the vegetation and other foods they naturally eat, he said. The park specially set up Dumpsters near the lake to discourage the practice. \u201cWe are not saying it\u2019s one branch of Judaism or another, or a particular neighborhood or synagogue,\u201d he added. \u201cNor is it organized.\u201d         \n\nOn the night before the first Seder of Passover, which this year begins after sundown Monday, many observant Jews scour the house to rid it of the last traces of bread or leavened grain products. That is because the Bible commands Jews to eat unleavened matzo as the ancient Israelites did when they fled Egypt without sufficient time to let their loaves of dough rise.         \n\nWhile many Jews simply toss the bread out with the trash or hide it out of sight, many observant Jews take their directions from Scripture and Jewish law. Some burn what they have collected, and in recent years several Orthodox neighborhoods have even staged elaborate bonfires, with the police and fire departments supervising. Others sell it to non-Jews in token fashion just for the eight days of Passover, then buy it back, sometimes  \n for help with the transaction.         \n\nBut since the Prospect Park letter was issued, Jewish leaders have been insisting that one thing that Jews do not customarily do is throw it into a lake.         \n\n\u201cI never heard of anyone doing that,\u201d said Rabbi Menachem Genack, the rabbinic administrator of the Orthodox Union, which certifies 500,000 food products around the world as kosher.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a rabbi in four cities and I\u2019ve never heard of such a thing, and they were cities with lovely parks, lakes and gardens,\u201d said Rabbi Sam Weintraub, of the Kane Street Synagogue in Cobble Hill. Some have accused the park officials of mixing up Jewish holidays, noting that on Rosh Hashana, a holiday of repentance, Jews on the first day do sprinkle bread crumbs into running water as a symbolic casting off of sins.         \n\nMr. Nelson, the alliance spokesman, denied that officials were confusing the two holidays and said that the alliance had consulted members of the Jewish community while drafting the letter, which was sent March 6.         \n\nRabbi David Niederman, executive director of United Jewish Organization of Williamsburg, said he thought critics were \u201cblowing things out of proportion.\u201d He suggested they were making what in Yiddish is called a tsimmes \u2014 a big, usually needless fuss.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe someone is trying to make a conspiracy against the Jewish community,\u201d he said.         \n\nRachel Goodman, chief of staff for City Councilman Brad Lander, said an Orthodox Jewish member of her staff reviewed the news release beforehand and saw nothing wrong.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the Prospect Park Alliance is saying that everyone gets rid of their bread this way,\u201d she said. \u201cBut from time to time they have seen folks \u2014 and they may not be Orthodox \u2014 who may be thinking that feeding the geese is a nice way to get rid of bread. And the alliance wanted to make sure they know that this is not helpful to the waterfowl.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/22/nyregion/prospect-park-ecology-letter-offends-some-observant-jews.html", "date": "2013-03-21", "description": "The Prospect Park Alliance defended its message, which implied that some Jews were improperly throwing bread to the waterfowl at Prospect Park Lake before Passover."}
