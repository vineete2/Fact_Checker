{"headline": "Guest Workers Are at Crux of Groups\u2019 Deal on Immigration", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The nation\u2019s top business and labor groups were near agreement Friday on a guest worker program for low-skilled immigrants, closing in on a deal that would eliminate one of the last significant obstacles to a new proposal for a broad overhaul of  \n laws, officials involved in the talks said.         \n\nThe progress in the talks, which stalled late last week, had members of a bipartisan group of eight senators that has been working on an immigration bill increasingly optimistic that they would be able to introduce comprehensive legislation in the Senate when Congress returns the second week of April.         \n\n\u201cWe are very close, closer than we\u2019ve ever been,\u201d said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and a member of the Senate group. \u201cWe are very optimistic, but there are a few issues remaining.\u201d         \n\nThe intense talks, and the willingness of the  \n and the  \n \u2014 two groups that have often found themselves deeply divided over the immigration debate \u2014 to try to hammer out an agreement, was an indication of how much the climate has changed on overhauling the nation\u2019s immigration laws.         \n\nWhen President George W. Bush pushed to revamp immigration laws in 2007, the inability of business and labor to agree on a plan for temporary guest workers was among the main reasons that effort failed. But now the two groups have weathered leaks to the news media and other setbacks in a sign of how serious both Democrats and Republicans are about getting a bill on President Obama\u2019s desk by the end of the year.         \n\nSome involved in the negotiations remained hopeful that a deal would be reached by the weekend, but the Congressional recess, along with the Good Friday observance, made it difficult to lock all the moving pieces in place, those close to the talks said. And, while the members of the bipartisan group were optimistic, aides cautioned that no deal would be final until all the senators had signed off on every piece of the legislation.         \n\nThe  \n and the  \n, the nation\u2019s main federation of labor unions, have been in discussions parallel to those of the Senate group, and have already reached a tentative agreement about the size and scope of a temporary guest worker program, which would grant up to 200,000 new visas annually for low-skilled workers. The labor-business talks  \n, on the eve of a two-week Congressional recess, over the issue of what the pay levels should be for low-skilled immigrants \u2014 often employed at restaurants and hotels or on construction projects \u2014 who could be brought in when employers said they faced labor shortages.         \n\nOne of the last sticking points in the business-labor negotiations has been the specific type of jobs that would be excluded from the program. The nation\u2019s construction unions, officials in the talks said, have persuaded the negotiators to exclude certain higher-skilled jobs, including crane operators and electricians, from the guest worker program.         \n\n \n, the secretary-treasurer of the Service Employees International Union and one of labor\u2019s most influential voices on immigration issues, said, \u201cWe may be very close to a point where the senators will have an announcement soon.\u201d         \n\nThe tentative agreement seems to satisfy both groups: The business community is likely to see a number of visas that it considers adequate, while the agreement on wages is likely to please labor because it is not expected to affect the labor market adversely.         \n\n\u201cThe labor movement has been united in making sure aspiring Americans get a road map to citizenship and that any future flow program doesn\u2019t reduce wages for any local workers,\u201d said Tom Snyder, manager of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.\u2019s Citizenship Now campaign. \u201cAnd we will succeed on both fronts because politicians have heard immigrant communities loud and clear: citizenship now.\u201d         \n\nStill, Randy Johnson, the senior vice president for labor, immigration, and employee benefits at the Chamber of Commerce, cautioned that any official agreement would come from the bipartisan Senate group.         \n\n\u201cWe advise senators on the Hill how to write the bill, and they decide on what bill would make sound legislation,\u201d he said.         \n\nAccording to participants in the conversations, after the business-labor talks came close to breaking down last week, some union officials pressed the labor negotiators to show more flexibility to avoid losing momentum over the guest worker issue. At the same time, some business leaders and Republican lawmakers pressed the Chamber to be more flexible on the guest worker issue so as not to derail the overall immigration overhaul.         \n\nBusiness and labor reached agreement in recent days on the contentious issue of how many guest workers would be admitted each year, several officials said. They said the number would start at 20,000 visas a year and could grow to a maximum of 200,000 annually.         \n\n\u201cThere is a formula that will allow it to grow and shrink according to economic needs,\u201d said Tamar Jacoby, the president of  \n, a group that represents small businesses on immigration matters.         \n\nShe said the formula agreed to was not flexible enough to meet the needs of specific industries in specific places.         \n\nThe number of guest workers allowed in would increase as the nation\u2019s unemployment rate fell and the number of job openings increased. A federal commission would also assess the need for guest workers, with an eye to shortages in specific industries and communities.         \n\nIn the negotiations, business vigorously objected to labor\u2019s push to have employers pay guest workers more than they pay local workers \u2014 an idea labor pushed to encourage employers to increase wages and to discourage them from bringing in guest workers.         \n\nTo settle that dispute, officials said, the two sides agreed that guest workers would be paid the prevailing industry wage previously used in the guest worker program. These officials said that employers who faced a labor shortage even after the national guest worker quota was filled could request a \u201csafety valve\u201d exemption to bring in workers, but with additional administrative hurdles and at a higher wage rate than the prevailing wage.         \n\n\u201cBusiness and labor leaders both agree that we need a system that responds to the needs of our economy, and we are now in a position where they\u2019re both coming together around key reforms that will fix the broken immigration system and move our economy forward,\u201d said John Feinblatt, the chief policy adviser to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York and the chairman of the  \n.
