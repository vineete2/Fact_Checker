{"headline": "Cubs Fire Manager, Leading to Talk About Girardi", "body": "\nCHICAGO \u2014 In the Cubs\u2019 137-year history, no two-season stretch has been worse, mathematically, than 2012 and 2013. After suffering 101 defeats a year ago, the Cubs lost another 96 games this season, and on Monday, the president for baseball operations, Theo Epstein, fired Manager Dale Sveum.         \n\nEpstein arrived in Chicago two years ago with the task of bringing a World Series title to a franchise that had just finished its 105th season without one. Sveum was brought in to groom young talent as the organization embraced rebuilding. Before he was hired, Sveum appeared headed to the Boston Red Sox, the team Epstein had just left. But Boston settled on a flashier candidate, Bobby Valentine. Two seasons later, Valentine and Sveum are both out of a job.         \n\nThe  \n have limped through the first two years of Epstein\u2019s tenure, with most of his resources and attention paid to acquiring young players. Chicago now has a handful of blue chip prospects and has one of the top farm systems. But Sveum never saw the benefits.         \n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision was absolutely not made to provide a scapegoat for our shortcomings or detract from our biggest issue: a shortage of talent at the major league level,\u201d Epstein said at a news conference.         \n\nSveum\u2019s undoing, Epstein said, was not his won-loss record but the lack of growth of the Cubs\u2019 young stars. Epstein signed shortstop Starlin Castro, 23, and first baseman Anthony Rizzo, 24, to long-term contract extensions, and both struggled this season. Castro batted a career-worst .245 after back-to-back All-Star seasons. Rizzo hit 23 home runs but struck out 127 times and hit only .233.         \n\nAs for where the Cubs turn next, many in Chicago are clamoring for the  \n\u2019 manager,  \n, whose ties to Chicago are strong: he grew up in nearby Peoria, went to college at Northwestern and played his first four big league seasons in Chicago.         \n\nThe Cubs would need the Yankees\u2019 permission to interview Girardi because he is under contract until Nov. 1. Epstein did not cite any candidates but said he would start the formal process of speaking with teams and coaches Tuesday morning.         \n\nHe emphasized the importance of leadership, said he preferred a candidate with major league managerial experience and added that ties to the Cubs organization would be a plus. Girardi certainly checks all three boxes. Yet on Sunday in Houston, he did not sound keen on returning to his Midwest roots.         \n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t lived there since 2006,\u201d Girardi said. \u201cMy father\u2019s gone. My mother\u2019s gone. So there\u2019s not as much there as there used to be.\u201d         \n\nGirardi lives in Westchester County and seems to like it, noting that his young family is settled there. On Sunday, he sounded more like someone who had contemplated taking a year or two off and then returning to managing.         \n\n\u201cIt depends what everyone wants,\u201d Girardi said. \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t to manage next year, I don\u2019t think that would be the last time I would manage.\u201d         \n\nAnother name linked to the Cubs is Brad Ausmus, who played 18 major league seasons and is a special assistant with the San Diego Padres.
