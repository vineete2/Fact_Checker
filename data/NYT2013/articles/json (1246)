Out-of-staters passing by on Route 15 may be mystified by the name, but to residents of central Pennsylvania the brightly lighted Sheetz convenience store, stocked with Utz chips and a Cupo\u2019ccino machine, is a source of pride \u2014 no, passion.         \n\n\u201cI would have to say I\u2019m a Sheetz girl,\u201d said Jennifer Zack, 34, handing the cashier a loyalty card with her coffee order.         \n\nJeff Marquette, 32, a cable installer stopping for a sandwich, said: \u201cI drive out of my way to go to Sheetz. That\u2019s sad, I know.\u201d         \n\nConvenience stores are supposed to be interchangeable, selling low-priced gas and self-serve coffee based on the proposition that when you need a pit stop, you turn in to the first you see, right there.         \n\nBut in Pennsylvania, two convenience chains stir tribal loyalties, a commitment as deep as bonds with the Philadelphia Phillies or Pittsburgh Pirates.         \n\nThe second also has a name that strafes outsiders\u2019 ears: Wawa. State lore has it that it is the honk of the goose on its logo.         \n\n\u201cWhen I moved here 13 years ago, I didn\u2019t want to go based on the name alone,\u201d said Caiti Fischer, stopping at a Wawa in Glen Mills, west of Philadelphia. It was not far from the town of Wawa, which is Mile Zero in the chain\u2019s history and the real source of its name.         \n\nMs. Fischer eventually changed her mind. \u201cI\u2019m here at least 10 times a week,\u201d she said. \u201cAt least.\u201d She cradled a 24-ounce vat of coffee at 4 in the afternoon. \u201cI can\u2019t stay away.\u201d         \n\nWawa\u2019s customers have been known to tattoo its name on their biceps. Its Facebook page has passed one million \u201clikes.\u201d The tie-dyed Hoagiefest T-shirt that the chain sells each summer is a collectors\u2019 item.         \n\nDon Longo, the editor of  \n, said Sheetz and Wawa were among a handful of regional chains in the country that he called \u201cbest in class.\u201d They operate convenience stores that update the old formula known as \u201cCoke and smokes\u201d by offering self-serve soda fountains and cappuccino bars, friendly service and, especially, fresh sandwiches ordered on a touch screen.         \n\nMitt Romney was excited by the technology at a Wawa on a presidential campaign bus tour last year. After keying in his meatball hoagie with pickles and sweet peppers, he declared the \u201ctouch tone\u201d pad a marvel. Mr. Romney was well aware of the Wawa versus Sheetz rivalry in Pennsylvania. \u201cI know it\u2019s a very big state divide,\u201d he told voters.         \n\nA political pollster in Harrisburg even surveyed Pennsylvanians on their favorite, though results were skewed because of Sheetz\u2019s wider state footprint.         \n\nOn the touch-screen issue, Sheetz was apparently first. A store manager in the 1980s was trying to move deli meats and let customers write orders on a slip of paper to deposit in a basket. Marketing and technology folks took it from there. \u201cI have to brag and say we beat Wawa,\u201d said a Sheetz spokeswoman, Monica Jones. \u201cThis is undisputed.\u201d         \n\nSheetz is the slightly smaller chain, with 226 stores in Pennsylvania and a total of 435 in the region. Wawa has 216 in-state stores and 607 over all, as far south as Tampa, Fla., and north to Parsippany, N.J.         \n\nThere are clear differences. Sheetz has neon colors, pumps loud country music and is overly fond of the alliterative use of its name in products. It sells Sheetz Shweetz, a CinnaShmonster and Shmuffins. Near its corporate headquarters in Altoona, it offers employees a  \n.         \n\nTo Sheetz\u2019s country mouse, Wawa is a more suburban creature. Its d\u00e9cor features muted browns and blonds, and a central island of healthy food includes diced mangoes and apple slices.         \n\n\u201cI think that Sheetz people are probably a little perkier than the Wawa people,\u201d said a regular named Doug, who was making his second visit of the day to the Sheetz in Selinsgrove. \u201cIt might have to do with we\u2019re up here where people are just a lot friendlier than they are down there.\u201d         \n\n\u201cDown there\u201d is Philadelphia and the Lehigh Valley, where Wawa fans can exude a whiff of cosmopolitan disdain. The crowd-sourced Urban Dictionary includes unflattering definitions for \u201cSheetz,\u201d like \u201ca convenience store/gas station where hicks from Lititz, Pa., like to hang out all night, every night.\u201d         \n\nIn Sheetz parlance, those night owls who fill the place after 2 a.m. are Sheetz Freakz.         \n\nAshley Timlin, 22, who stopped in at the Wawa in Glen Mills, told a tale often heard about young people who leave for college but pine for the tastes of home. \u201cMy friend moved to Florida and moved back and went on a Wawa binge for two weeks,\u201d she said.         \n\nUp the road in Lancaster, Joy Deckman, 56, a nurse, was picking up a Sheetz sandwich after ordering from a screen that was promoting new menu items: fried pickle chips and Boom Boom sauce. She, too, had a tale of the siren call of a fast-food favorite.         \n\n\u201cWhenever we travel, my husband will pull into a Sheetz before anything else,\u201d she said. \u201cHe likes Sheetz better than Wawa. He likes the food better, and no offense, but men are driven by their stomachs.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/us/10convenience.html", "date": "2013-02-09", "description": "The comforts of two chains of convenience stores \u2014 Wawa in the east, and Sheetz to the west \u2014 inspire Pennsylvanians to choose sides."}
