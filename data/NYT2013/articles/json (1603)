{"headline": "The Demented Imagineer", "body": "\n\u201cNow, I see this as pantsless,\u201d the artist Paul McCarthy announced one winter morning to a group of male actors standing at the edge of a massive soundstage in a warehouse east of downtown Los Angeles, flanked by a plumbing supply and an auto impound yard. Normally, McCarthy looks like a hipster carpenter, broad and bandylegged, with gnarled fingers and wiry white hair poking out around his baseball cap. But this morning he was nearly unrecognizable in a tuxedo and gray toupee, a regal prosthetic nose glued over a neatly trimmed mustache.         \n\nThe transformation was startling not only because McCarthy, 67, had succeeded in making himself look quite a bit like Walt Disney, but also because his version of Walt smacked \u2014 obviously but also hilariously \u2014 of Hitler. He shook my hand, and I asked how he was.         \n\n\u201cPretty exhausted,\u201c he said. \u201cI picked a fight with Grumpy yesterday, and it got a little out of hand.\u201d He sank back into a chair, nursing a badly bruised elbow.         \n\nToday\u2019s filming would be much less crazy, he announced. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to be a light day, a music day.\u201d But before long, McCarthy as Disney \u2014 or Walt Paul, as he called his amalgamated character \u2014 was rampaging alongside an actress dressed as Snow White and the male actors done up like scrofulous-looking dwarves, to the din of a kitchen pot that Dopey pummeled into a metallic lump. The cacophony built toward pantslessness, and within minutes McCarthy and the dwarves were dancing a conga line, tights and trousers around their ankles, penises flapping in the air like pompoms. McCarthy\u2019s son, Damon, holding a high-end video camera, brought the scene to a close and seemed satisfied. He walked past me, grinning: \u201cJust another day at the office.\u201d And everyone took five.         \n\nThe Snow White project, which will make its debut at the Park Avenue Armory in New York on June 19, is \u2014 even for an artist whose subject is outsize spectacle \u2014 a monster. It necessitated the creation of an 8,800-square-foot artificial forest, filled with glowering brown plastic-foam trees whose branches undulate more than 20 feet into the air, concealing in their midst what enchanted forests often do: a cottage. This one, however, owed nothing to the Brothers Grimm or Gustave Dor\u00e9 or Disney. It was a faithful replica of the canary yellow ranch house in Salt Lake City where McCarthy himself was raised, the son of a liberal Mormon homemaker and a grocery-store butcher. In its evocation of childhood set amid a kind of pop catastrophe, the project is quintessential McCarthy. For four decades, his version of American Gothic has been so perverse and outrageous, bloody and scatological, that it remains disturbing for even art-world initiates.         \n\nWhen I first visited the set in its early stages last November, McCarthy had placed a conference table at the forest\u2019s edge, so that he could convene meetings while looking at the work, the way a painter spends time with a canvas, except on an environmental scale. (The space is so large that whenever a landline call comes in for McCarthy, a loudspeaker rings out: \u201cCall for Paul! Call for Paul!\u201d) At that moment, he was struggling with how to complicate the set. \u201cIt needs abstracting. . . . I need a lot more time to screw it up,\u201d he said, using a much more descriptive verb.         \n\nThis entire colossus, forest and house sets \u2014 which McCarthy calls \u201cWS,\u201d for \u201cWhite Snow\u201d \u2014 would soon be packed into dozens of tractor-trailers headed for New York, where the Park Avenue Armory has prepared the ground for anyone expecting a bedtime story. \u201c \n,\u201d its Web site warns. The forest, paired with projections of the kind of footage I\u2019d watched him shooting, will be the largest single work McCarthy has ever presented in America, and certainly the most important show he has ever had in New York, where he was long regarded as a West Coast cult phenomenon. (McCarthy didn\u2019t sell his first substantial piece until he was 45.) To coincide with the Armory exhibition, his gallery, Hauser & Wirth, will host four separate Manhattan exhibitions.         \n\nMcCarthy views \u201cWS\u201d very much as a work in progress. Once the New York show is over, he intends to repatriate it to Los Angeles, where it can grow and mutate, possibly for years. And yet the forest is not even the most complex work he has planned. He recently bought a thousand acres of rolling scrubland north of Los Angeles to construct an Old West town for a series of demented westerns he envisions filming, another milepost on what amounts to the creation of his own B-movie studio.         \n\nAs he hurtles ahead with these multimillion-dollar projects, many of them so unwieldy that their prospects of making it into collections or institutions are uncertain at best, McCarthy has set out on a path more ambitious than almost any American artist now working, one not even he is sure he can follow. \u201cIt\u2019s necessary to do what I have to do, and I see the art world the same way,\u201d he told me, sitting at the big conference table with the artificial trees looming over us. \u201cI could retreat. I could do it another way, maybe. But obviously I\u2019m not going to turn it around at this point. I\u2019m only digging myself deeper.\u201d         \n\nPaul Schimmel, the former chief curator of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles and a longtime McCarthy supporter, told me: \u201cThe thing about Paul \u2014 and it comes partly from so many years of lack of success \u2014 is that he is willing to bet absolutely everything, put the entire pot on the table and double down and say, \u2018I\u2019m going to push this to the brink.\u2019 The potential for massive failure \u2014 financially, intellectually \u2014 is always there, and now it\u2019s as big as it\u2019s ever been. I think that kind of risk is what keeps him pure.\u201d         \n\n \n whose work is still underrepresented in public collections because it makes many museum officials squirm, McCarthy lives a life of remarkable domesticity. He and his wife, Karen, an ebullient fellow Utahan, have been married for 46 years and are rarely apart. In the 1980s, when McCarthy had no money and worked in construction, they built the modest wood-frame house where they still live; he designed it so that none of the roof beams weighed too much for him and Karen to hoist alone.         \n\nThe house, near Pasadena, at the foot of the San Gabriel Mountains, is cluttered and usually full of art people, grandchildren and dogs. When I visited, there was a pet turtle in the back and a treadmill in the living room. It could have been home to a couple of English professors, except that just off the living room, in a small studio, there hangs a prominent picture of a bare-bottomed mannequin excreting a sausage into a bowl, a still from a 1992 film reimagining the Swiss classic \u201cHeidi\u201d that McCarthy made with his fellow Los Angeles artist Mike Kelley.         \n\nThe McCarthys run the studio as a family business, mulling over personnel issues in the mornings on their back deck (the studio sometimes employs more than 40 people full and part time). Damon, 39, who is his father\u2019s chief collaborator, lives nearby, as does the McCarthys\u2019 daughter, Mara, 34, who runs a highly regarded downtown gallery, the Box, where she often shows the work of underrated artists from her parents\u2019 generation. \u201cI basically knew my dad as a guy who worked in construction, and the art part was just something that was around,\u201d Mara said of a fairly normal middle-class Los Angeles childhood that included high-school baseball for Damon and gymnastics for her.         \n\nThe McCarthys fly in a better class than they used to, but otherwise their life shows few traces of the financial success that, in recent years, has put McCarthy in the same rarefied realm as artists like Jeff Koons, Cindy Sherman and Richard Prince. His sculptures \u2014 cartoon figures, uncanny McCarthy avatars, supersize inflatable feces \u2014 can sell for more than a million dollars apiece. In 2011, one \u2014 a toylike character topped with a huge tomato head with holes for inserting eyes, ears and genitalia \u2014 went for $4.5 million at Christie\u2019s, setting an auction record for his work. \u201cI never really think about the money,\u201d McCarthy told me over sandwiches one afternoon at the house. \u201cI just think about the next piece and about how we\u2019ll do it and how much it will be. And sometimes I think, Wow, that\u2019s a lot. And sometimes we have it, and sometimes we don\u2019t.\u201d         \n\nIn addition to the large studio east of downtown, there is a 20,000-square-foot space, in the Baldwin Park neighborhood, dedicated to sculptural casting and to eerie animatronic pieces that have been a staple of McCarthy\u2019s work, made by some of the most-sought-after special-effects artists and sculptors in Hollywood. (One sculptor left Disney last year and then went to work for McCarthy.) Over the last several months, negotiations were completed for yet another warehouse, a 150,000-square-foot behemoth near downtown that will allow him to consolidate storage and give him an even larger soundstage environment.         \n\nMcCarthy presides over this mushrooming enterprise as a generally benevolent but tireless sort of director-producer, constantly in motion, addressing everyone, man and woman alike, as \u201cdude.\u201d Much of his time is spent shuttling between his various locations in a white Subaru hatchback, which meant that many of our deepest conversations took place along the 210 Freeway or else at a sausage-and-beer joint near his daughter\u2019s gallery, where he and Karen like to go. Sitting there, listening to him describe becoming what amounts to the George Lucas of his own maniacal Industrial Light and Magic, I constantly found myself looking at the happy-seeming people around us and thinking: \n.         \n\n \n as minimalism was blurring into the performance-heavy world of conceptual art. But even under conceptualism\u2019s cool spell, his early pieces were hard-core. \u201cWhen I first came to Los Angeles, I had this idea where I drew a line straight across a big map of the city and then tried to walk it,\u201d he recalls. \u201cBut it meant you had to go through people\u2019s backyards and over roofs and walk long diagonals across busy freeways. There was no way to do it without getting killed.\u201d While still an art student at the University of Utah, he executed a homage to Yves Klein\u2019s famous 1960 \u201cLeap Into the Void,\u201d a doctored photograph showing Klein doing a swan dive to the pavement from a roof ledge in a Paris suburb. But McCarthy had only read about the photograph and had no idea it was faked. He threw himself feet first out of a second-floor window and somehow avoided breaking his ankles.         \n\nHis Salt Lake City childhood was a fettered, anxious 1950s-suburban one. He was dyslexic, which made school traumatic: \u201cI just remember being afraid all the time.\u201d But the condition revealed to him early on that he experienced words and images differently from everyone else. \u201cFor me, each part of a conversation,\u201d he says, \u201calways had a position in space.\u201d         \n\nIn the late 1960s, he settled in San Francisco, but Los Angeles always seemed the inevitable destination. \u201cIt was like L.A. chose me,\u201d he says. First, he and Karen lived in Echo Park, and McCarthy worked in derelict downtown spaces. Then they moved to Pasadena, whose empty storefronts became an unlikely hotbed of art in the early 1970s, home to Bruce Nauman and Allan Kaprow, whose participatory, evanescent \u201chappenings\u201d (he once built a wall near the  \n with bread and jelly as mortar) were deeply influential for McCarthy.         \n\nOver the last half-century, some of the most acidic and genuinely terrifying American artwork has emerged from the sun-splashed studios of Los Angeles \u2014 Ed Kienholz\u2019s \u201cFive Car Stud,\u201d a sculptural tableau of six white men castrating a black man; Chris Burden\u2019s performances in which he wriggled across a parking lot spread with broken glass and had himself shot in the arm with a .22-caliber rifle; Nauman\u2019s videos of clowns being \u201ctortured.\u201d (\u201cLike getting hit in the face with a baseball bat,\u201d Nauman said of the intended effect. \u201cOr better, like getting hit in the back of the neck. You never see it coming.\u201d)         \n\nMcCarthy\u2019s early work was primarily performance and about as close as an American came to the extremes of the Viennese Actionists, artists whose notorious works in the 1960s sometimes involved real blood and real criminality \u2014 enough to land them in jail. In 1976, before a classroom of students at the University of California, San Diego, McCarthy performed \u201cClass Fool,\u201d a shamanistic, quasi-sexual ritual with plastic dolls, in which he crawled around naked and smeared with ketchup, retching at the conclusion. \u201cEarly on,\u201d he says, \u201cit was about understanding something about the absurdity of normality in the face of everyday existence. It was about trying to make work that grinds into something.\u201d         \n\nAs the performances developed, they became more overtly comical, though rarely any easier to watch. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like eating meat,\u201d Burden, a longtime friend of McCarthy\u2019s, told me about his work. \u201cI mean, I love meat. But I\u2019m not sure that I want to go to the slaughter yard. And that\u2019s where Paul takes you.\u201d (The analogy is apt in more ways than one. In McCarthy\u2019s world, consumer foodstuffs, sometimes rotted \u2014 hot dogs, ketchup, mayonnaise, hamburger meat, chocolate \u2014 are like paint and plaster.)         \n\nIn what he calls not films but \u201cperformance videos,\u201d he began to wear masks and take on personas \u2014 cartoon characters like Olive Oyl and Pinocchio. Increasingly, the personas became those of patriarchal types \u2014 a ship\u2019s captain, Santa Claus, Willem de Kooning. McCarthy says that he doesn\u2019t have any inherent interest in fairy tales or childhood stories but that, like westerns, they provide him with simple, archetypal, often moralizing stories \u2014 of family, society, good and evil. In some ways, Walt Disney seems to be the figure he has been practicing to eviscerate his whole life.         \n\nTo anyone who thinks of contemporary art as a confrontational, profane, puerile, nihilistic, body-obsessed in-joke, McCarthy provides a near-perfect example of all that has gone wrong since the \u201960s. His work can \u2014 and does \u2014 provoke physical revulsion. But it is not mere provocation; it\u2019s intended as an all-out assault, a \u201cprogram of resistance,\u201d as he calls it. And the older he gets, the more explicit he has become that his target is the American entertainment-consumer economy. \u201cI can see much more clearly now that we are living in the middle of this kind of insanity,\u201d he told me, \u201cand it runs itself. And the really scary thing is that we\u2019re not conscious of it anymore. It\u2019s a kind of fascism. The end goal of this kind of capitalism is to erase difference, to eradicate cultures, to turn us all into a form of cyborg, people who all want the same thing.\u201d This may be true, but even if you agree, you still have the sneaking feeling that the perversity is so abundant simply because it lights him up; it\u2019s his m\u00e9tier.         \n\nHis work was never meant to be easy for the commercial art world to digest, which for a long time, it didn\u2019t. \u201cA lot of stuff got thrown out,\u201d he says. \u201cThere were times when we needed space, and we would just take a load out to the dump.\u201d After one long trip to Europe, during which he was living hand-to-mouth (and also was robbed), he recalled: \u201cI came back and I was pretty screwed up. I had to figure out what to do \u2014 two kids and no money, you know?\u201d He and Karen were on the verge of moving back to Utah when Burden, then teaching at U.C.L.A., helped McCarthy get a part-time teaching job. McCarthy also found piecemeal work in Hollywood; he was on the crew of the first \u201cStar Trek\u201d movie in 1978, assisting with special-effects photography. \u201cIt affected me,\u201d he says now, \u201cbeing on the Paramount lot especially.\u201d         \n\nLike Burden, who gave up pure performance and started creating sculpture and installations, McCarthy decided that to have a lasting influence in the art world, he had to begin making objects. But he did so without losing the impact of his performances. The turning point for his career was \u201cThe Garden,\u201d from 1992, a small Arcadian patch of artificial forest (some of it recycled from sets for the television series \u201cBonanza\u201d) that connects his early work with the kind of massive set-building he undertakes now. As viewers walk around it, two animatronic male mannequins become visible, both with their pants down, one standing and copulating placidly with a tree and the other lying down, doing the same to the earth.         \n\n\u201cI was in another room, and before I ever laid eyes on it, I heard people gasping,\u201d says Jeffrey Deitch, who was a New York-based art adviser when he saw the piece in an influential show of Los Angeles art, \u201cHelter Skelter,\u201d curated by Paul Schimmel, at the Museum of Contemporary Art. Deitch, now the director of MOCA in Los Angeles, bought the piece and later showed it in an exhibition that toured Europe. He considered it a new kind of work, a performance sculpture. \u201cIt\u2019s rare that an artist invents a wholly new structure for art,\u201d he says, \u201cand Paul did that.\u201d         \n\nYet even after so many years of being lionized by fellow artists and curators, McCarthy has remained a figure little known outside the art world. Tom Eccles, a longtime New York curator who is helping to organize the Armory exhibition, recounted a story of introducing McCarthy at a New School lecture in Manhattan. \u201cI showed a lot of tough images, and everyone looked a little frightened. And then when Paul finally came out to the stage, a group of older people up front got up and stomped out. They thought they were coming to see Paul McCartney.\u201d         \n\n \n as an art-world secret is likely to change in the next few years. In November, he and Karen drove me to a patch of chaparral and rolling grassland that sits between the San Joaquin Valley and the Mojave Desert. On the drive there, up California State Route 14, past Edwards Air Force Base, the land becomes flatter and browner, and signs begin to pop up about God, mostly the vengeful Old Testament version, along with ominous Northrop Grumman billboards showing only an image of a dark gray military drone and the slogan \u201cSecuring the Globe, 36 Hours at a Time.\u201d Just two hours north of the city, this is full-blown John Ford country \u2014 part of \u201cThe Grapes of Wrath\u201d was filmed around here, outside the town of Tehachapi. And it\u2019s also where McCarthy bought the thousand acres on which he plans to build his own Cinecitt\u00e0 to make anti-westerns among the California pinyon pines.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a pretty crazy idea, even for me,\u201d he said, looking over a sparsely wooded basin where he has tentatively platted his Old West town, composed of all the familiar structures of frontier civilization \u2014 saloon, sheriff\u2019s office, general store, bank, hotel/brothel. In the recreation room of a plain ranch house on the land, he keeps a conference-table-size architectural layout of the town, with plastic models to represent the buildings. The windowless structures will be mostly disorienting, claustrophobic and repetitive. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be like going into a saloon or a jail or an outhouse,\u201d McCarthy said, fiddling with the models. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be like going into someone\u2019s head, into their mind.\u201d         \n\nThis little Dodge City will be unlike any other land-based art or public art in the country, if it ever opens to the public, a subject about which McCarthy is still highly ambivalent. He originally wanted to buy land to build the town along a major highway, so that it would be visible, like a crackpot theme park, to hundreds of thousands of people passing on their way to work. He also toyed with buying Santa\u2019s Village in the San Bernardino Mountains, a family-run amusement park with gingerbread houses and live reindeer that closed in 1998 after more than four decades in business. But the isolation of Tehachapi and the cost of its real estate \u2014 \u201cWe bought it basically for the price of desert land,\u201d he says \u2014 appealed to him. Among the hurdles to creating the town is the task of getting city construction permits for buildings that don\u2019t fit into any known category of municipal structure. \u201cNinety percent of the time I don\u2019t even mention the word \u2018art\u2019 at all,\u201d says Damon McCarthy, who has been talking to Tehachapi officials about their plans. \u201cIt just really confuses people.\u201d         \n\n \n visited McCarthy\u2019s main Los Angeles studio, in late February, filming was under way in the forest, which had grown freakish over the few months since I had seen it. It was overrun with huge plastic acid-trip flowers and thickets of underbrush installed by a Hollywood set company. The towering leafless brown trees looked both funny and unmistakably fecal. In a huge adjoining room, domestic sets replicated the interior of McCarthy\u2019s childhood home down to the faux-ormolu-framed mirror in the living room and a rust stain in the bathroom sink. Actors emerged from the makeup room done up like dwarves, with scrotum-like bulbous noses and tighty-whitey underwear over leggings. Elyse Poppers, the actress who plays McCarthy\u2019s primary \u201cWhite Snow\u201d character (following a kind of dream logic, there are doppelg\u00e4ngers), walked around in a red ball gown for that day\u2019s scene, a party in which relations between the maternal-erotic White Snow and her earthy cartoonish hosts start to reel out of control.         \n\nThis Snow White would not follow much of a fairy-tale narrative \u2014 no evil queen, no magic mirror, no resurrection through a prince\u2019s love. At one point, two of the Snow Whites, most of the dwarves and McCarthy lay in a moaning, panting, undulating pile on the living-room floor that McCarthy intended as a visual echo of an image in Jack Smith\u2019s 1963 underground transvestite romp, \u201cFlaming Creatures.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about sex,\u201d he told me of his own scene. \u201cIt\u2019s about basic human contact. It\u2019s about hanging onto someone else for dear life.\u201d         \n\nWhen they finished, McCarthy hopped up and seemed barely out of breath. He was practically glowing. \u201cO.K., we take five and then we\u2019ll go again,\u201d he announced. \u201cLike yesterday, we\u2019ll kind of start this as a see-where-it-goes. Then we amp it up. We  \n it somewhere.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/12/magazine/paul-mccarthy-the-demented-imagineer.html", "date": "2013-05-10", "description": "Paul McCarthy may qualify as one of the grand old men of the art world, but his vision is perverse as ever \u2014 and much, much bigger."}
