{"headline": "Red Sox Have Edge in Beanball Wars", "body": "\nRyan Dempster, a Boston  \n starting pitcher, managed to do something last month that few thought possible. By repeatedly throwing at the Yankees\u2019 embattled third baseman,  \n, until he hit him, he left any number of people rushing to Rodriguez\u2019s defense.         \n\nWhile he was at it, Dempster reopened the debate over whether sending a message with a fastball to the back has a place in today\u2019s game. He also, whether he knew it or not, continued a long-established trend in which the Red Sox plunk the Yankees far more than the other way around, an issue that may come into play over the next four days as the teams meet in a key weekend series in the Bronx.         \n\nDempster hit Rodriguez in a nationally televised game at Fenway Park on Aug. 18. At the time, Rodriguez was playing in his 12th game since coming back from a season-long stay on the disabled list, his return occurring on the same day he was issued a 211-game drug suspension that he is appealing.         \n\nRodriguez\u2019s decision to keep playing after a dozen other players linked to the same performance-enhancing-drug case accepted their suspensions instantly made him into something of a pariah. To some players, including various members of the Red Sox, it felt as if Rodriguez was cheating by remaining on the field.         \n\nOne of those who apparently felt that way was Dempster, who threw repeatedly at Rodriguez in his first at-bat of that Aug. 18 game before drilling him with a fastball. The pitch enraged  \n Manager  \n and seemed to motivate Rodriguez and his teammates, who rallied to win the game, with Rodriguez hitting an emphatic home run off none other than Dempster himself.         \n\nDempster, who was briefly suspended as a result of his actions, pitched on Wednesday night against Detroit and will thus be a bystander this weekend. But the Yankees might answer back by hitting one of the Boston hitters, even if it risks a series of brushback pitches and beanballs.         \n\nOf course, if Girardi can be taken at his word, the Red Sox have little to fear. Girardi was openly critical of Dempster in the aftermath of the Aug. 18 game, saying: \u201cThat baseball is a weapon. It\u2019s not a tennis ball; it\u2019s not an IncrediBall that\u2019s soft. It\u2019s a weapon, and it can do a lot of damage to someone\u2019s life.\u201d         \n\nIn general, Girardi\u2019s actions have lived up to those ideals. Since he took over as manager of the Yankees in 2008, the Red Sox have hit 67 Yankees batters, and the Yankees have hit just 49 Red Sox batters.         \n\nIn fact, stretching back a decade further, to 1998, the Red Sox lead the hit-by-pitch matchup, 162 to 116, having hit more batters in their season series with New York in 13 of those 16 seasons. Twice they hit 18 Yankees batters in a single year. This season they have hit 10 Yankees and been hit five times in return.         \n\nThis trend even holds all the way back to at least 1950. Since then, the Red Sox have outscored the Yankees in the beanball war, 337 to 264.         \n\nIn the aftermath of the Dempster-Rodriguez incident, the longtime Red Sox slugger David ortiz sided more with Rodriguez than his own teammate, saying Dempster\u2019s actions had woken up the Yankees in that game and motivated them to win it.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it was the right thing to do,\u201d he said of Rodriguez being hit. \u201cBut we don\u2019t all think alike.\u201d         \n\nIn subsequent comments, Ortiz also raised the possibility that the Yankees might choose to retaliate, although if they did, Ortiz might not be the target.         \n\nEven though American League teams generally respond to a prominent player\u2019s being hit by throwing at the most prominent player on the other team, the popular Ortiz has generally emerged unscathed. He has been hit just 32 times in his career and, amazingly enough, just once in 185 games against the Yankees, many of them fiercely fought battles.         \n\nThat one instance came on June 9, 2011, when C. C. Sabathia hit Ortiz with a pitch in the top of the fourth. Somehow, in 809 plate appearances against the Yankees, in which he has hammered them with a .316 batting average, a .574 slugging percentage and 39 home runs, no other Yankees pitcher has bounced a baseball off his sizable frame.         \n\nSince 1998, the Red Sox batter hit most by Yankees pitchers is Kevin Youkilis (now a Yankee), who was hit 14 times and also had a couple of Joba Chamberlain pitches sail over his head. Another signature Boston hitter of recent vintage, Manny Ramirez, was hit seven times by the Yankees in his years with the Red Sox.         \n\nThe Red Sox, meanwhile, have shown considerably less restraint. Jason Giambi was hit 16 times by Boston in his time with the Yankees, a number now matched by Rodriguez. But both trail Derek Jeter, who leads all Yankees batters with 24 plunkings by Boston since he began his major league career in 1995.         \n\nPerhaps the last word on all this should come from the two Yankees catchers, Chris Stewart and Austin Romine, who will be calling the pitches against the Red Sox over the next four days.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to say right now that if we hit someone, it\u2019s not going to be on purpose,\u201d Romine said. Alluding to the fact that Boston is comfortably in first place in the American League East and the Yankees are battling uphill for a playoff spot, he added, \u201cIt\u2019s crunch time for us; we\u2019re not going to mess around.\u201d         \n\nEchoing Romine, Stewart said: \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to send a message now. We have games to win, and we\u2019re not necessarily in the right seat to be trying to retaliate in any way.\u201d         \n\nTo be continued on Thursday night, with Jake Peavy and Ivan Nova on the mound and Ortiz, Jeter and Rodriguez at the plate.
