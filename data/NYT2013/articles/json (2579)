{"headline": "Heading Into Preseason Finale, Giants\u2019 Offense Is a Concern ", "body": "\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. \u2014 The Giants faced fourth-and-goal at the 2-yard line late in the opening half of Saturday night\u2019s preseason game against the Jets when  \n looked for Hakeem Nicks on a fade pattern. He later estimated that he underthrew the ball by a foot, the difference between allowing Nicks to snag it for a touchdown and having safety Dawan Landry render the pass incomplete.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad play,\u201d Manning said. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t execute good enough.\u201d         \n\nThe narrow miss helps to illustrate how close to \u2014 or far from \u2014 clicking the Giants\u2019 injury-depleted offense is as the season opener Sept. 8 at Dallas comes into view. The team enters its preseason finale, Thursday night at New England, with two offensive touchdowns, an unsettling bottom line.         \n\nAlthough Coach  \n said he intended to limit Manning and the rest of the first-team offense to 12 to 15 snaps, he is pushing for results.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see some continuity and some execution, some performance,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like to see us get the ball in the end zone.\u201d         \n\nThe Giants have struggled to sustain drives. Their top unit converted one of eight third-down opportunities in the 24-21 loss to the Jets and is 3 of 16 the last two games.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been close on occasion,\u201d Coughlin said. \u201cBut the consistent execution, play in and play out, is not there yet.\u201d         \n\nCoughlin likes to refer to the area inside the opponent\u2019s 20 as the green zone rather than the red zone, because it represents great opportunities. The Giants have advanced to the green zone eight times this preseason and have yet to reach the end zone.         \n\nManning said, \u201cWe have to learn from these things and make adjustments and make sure they carry over to the practice field and we\u2019re practicing at a high level, at a fast pace.\u201d         \n\nLast season delineated how much team success is related to a productive offense. The Giants, despite missing the playoffs at 9-7, were among nine teams to score at least 400 points. Those nine compiled a .681 winning percentage.         \n\nThe Giants, after finishing with the second-highest point total in franchise history, reminded the league how explosive they could be when the second-year running back David Wilson broke off an 84-yard scoring run on the first play from scrimmage last weekend. The other 31 plays for the first unit yielded only 97 yards.         \n\nThe Giants never discuss injuries in explaining these shortcomings, but they are certainly a factor. Coughlin will again experiment with his offensive line in New England as the group works to overcome the absence of two starters: center David Baas and right tackle David Diehl. Baas, who strained the medial collateral ligament in his left knee, may be able to start at Dallas. Diehl, who struggled at right tackle, will be out significantly longer after having thumb surgery.         \n\nHenry Hynoski, a fullback whose blocking is an important ingredient in the running and passing games, has been out since he injured his left knee in May on the first day of organized team activities. He says he is optimistic he can rejoin the lineup in time to face the Cowboys.         \n\nAlso optimistic is Victor Cruz, the team leader with 86 catches for 1,092 yards and 10 touchdown receptions in 2012. He has been sidelined since bruising his left heel against the Indianapolis Colts in the second preseason game. He wore a protective walking boot until Monday. He alternated hot and cold treatments and performed various exercises, including picking up marbles with his toes, to accelerate progress.         \n\n\u201cIt feels a lot better,\u201d Cruz said Tuesday, the final day of practice before the team flew to New England. \u201cA lot of the swelling has gone down.\u201d         \n\nCruz\u2019s return will ease pressure on Nicks, who has three catches for 74 yards in the preseason. Manning emphasized the need to feel more in sync with Nicks.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still working,\u201d said Manning, the first Giants quarterback to pass for more than 3,000 yards in eight consecutive seasons. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get back to where we\u2019re both playing at a high level. The throws have to be better. The routes have got to be better.\u201d         \n\nCoughlin said he planned to have Ryan Nassib, a fourth-round pick from Syracuse, replace Manning fairly early against New England. Coughlin is looking to give time to David Carr and Curtis Painter, veteran reserves, in the second half. If the offense continues to sputter, Coughlin does not intend to depart from that in his determination to protect Manning.         \n\n\u201cI would err on the side of safety,\u201d Coughlin said.
