{"headline": "Fiorano Wine Estate in Italy Making a Comeback", "body": "\nROME \u2014 A fresh breeze was blowing in from the Mediterranean to the west, clearing the air here at the Fiorano estate on a brilliant day this month. The harvest was in, the grapes had been crushed and the juice was settling in concrete tanks in the newly constructed winery, beginning the slow process of fermentation.         \n\nTen years ago, this scene was unimaginable. Fiorano had once been a self-sustaining estate of more than 700 acres, on the ancient Appian Way within the city limits of Rome. It was rich with fruit trees, wheat, cattle, vegetables and olive oil, but by the turn of the century, the vineyard was gone, the fields neglected and the buildings crumbling.         \n\n\u00a0The elderly proprietor, Alberico Boncompagni Ludovisi, the prince of Venosa back in the years when Italy recognized royalty, had torn out the vines and abandoned the estate for a hotel, where he would die in 2005.  \n.         \n\nFiorano is back in business. The vineyard and fields have been replanted. The trees are thick with olives; fruits and vegetables are thriving. Goats are giving milk for cheese and honey is gathered from hives. Once more, wine is being made.         \n\nWhether it can be as distinctive as the wine made by the prince may not be evident for years, but Alessia Antinori, a granddaughter, says she is determined to carry on the legacy. Though she comes from a historic winemaking family,  \n, with a history in Tuscany that goes back centuries and holdings in Washington and California, Ms. Antinori, 37, has taken on the restoration of Fiorano as her personal project, independent of the Antinori empire.         \n\n\u201cWhen I was an oenology student in Milan, I would often go to my grandfather for advice,\u201d she said as we walked through the vineyard, from where we could see the towering dome of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica at the Vatican in the distance. \u201cWe became very close, sharing a deep passion for winemaking that I am continuing in his name here at Fiorano.\u201d         \n\nWhen the prince inherited the Fiorano estate in 1946, it was planted with the local grapes, which made nondescript wines. He replanted the vineyard with cabernet sauvignon and merlot long before these Bordeaux grapes became fashionable in Italy, and with the white grapes malvasia and s\u00e9millon. At a time when agriculture looked increasingly to chemical farming, he insisted on farming organically. He aged the wine in large old barrels, which over time came to be covered in a fine white mold that he deemed to be beneficial.         \n\nThe red wines were revelatory; complex, graceful, elegant and long-lived. Though made from French grapes, they seemed unmistakably Italian, with an internal architecture derived more from acidity than tannins. The whites were equally profound and perhaps even more striking. While almost all Italian whites at the time were made to be consumed young, these whites aged and improved for decades.         \n\nThe wines were as prized by connoisseurs as they were little known to the general public. But over the years, the prince grew eccentric. Those who had purchased the wine, like the American importer Neil Empson, who brought it to the United States in the 1970s, eventually stopped doing business with him. By the time he tore out his vines, without explanation, the wines had largely been forgotten.         \n\nAfter the prince died, legal wrangling dogged the disposition of the estate. Eventually it was divided up. One part went to the prince\u2019s daughter, Francesca, Alessia Antinori\u2019s mother, who gave it to her three daughters to oversee. Another part, including the old cellar, went to Alessandrojacopo Boncompagni Ludovisi, a cousin of the prince, who had been living on the property and who had bought several parcels on the estate from the prince.         \n\nOn inspecting the property, Ms. Antinori found that despite the prince\u2019s most destructive efforts, a small plot of vines remained, four rows of cabernet sauvignon and four rows of merlot. Her vineyard team nursed them back to health, and beginning in 2011 has produced about 500 bottles annually from them. She also found a few old vines of white grapes on a part of the property that her grandfather had sold to a former caretaker. They are now nurturing these vines as well.         \n\nUsing cuttings from the old vines, they have replanted about 30 acres of grapes on the same rootstocks her grandfather used. Meanwhile, Ms. Antinori has built a new winery in what had been stables, using big, old oak casks to age the wine, though sadly not the mold-covered casks the prince used.         \n\nWhile there, I drank a fresh, exuberant 2011 red made from the young vines, which Ms. Antinori calls Fioranello. The first wines made from the old vines won\u2019t be ready to drink until sometime next year, she said. Only a small amount of wine has been produced so far, and it is not yet available in the United States, although Ms. Antinori foresees that. Rather than market the wine through the Antinori sales apparatus, Ms. Antinori says she will oversee all sales.         \n\n\u201cWe want to sell it to the historical clients of Fiorano,\u201d she said, \u201cthe people who have always believed in and loved this wine, and to private collectors who would appreciate and understand it, just in the same way our grandfather did it.\u201d         \n\nHer effort to revive Fiorano faces a potential complication. Alessandrojacopo Boncompagni Ludovisi, who lives on another portion of the estate, is also making wine there and calling it Fiorano.         \n\n\u201cHe went ahead and registered the label of Fiorano without consulting our side of the family,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can imagine how disappointing this was for us.\u201d         \n\nMr. Boncompagni Ludovisi wrote in an e-mail that he had begun planting a vineyard on the property in 2002 under the guidance of the prince. He counseled him, Mr. Boncompagni Ludovisi said, to plant cabernet sauvignon and merlot for red wine, but to replace the malvasia and s\u00e9millon with grechetto and viognier for white. His label is  \n, and some of his wines are available locally in Rome. Eventually, he said, he hopes to export to the United States.         \n\nIt\u2019s a confusing situation. For her part, Ms. Antinori believes a resolution is possible. \u201cI think there\u2019s space for both wines on the market,\u201d she said, \u201cand I trust that we will help each other if necessary.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/23/dining/fiorano-wine-estate-in-italy-making-a-comeback.html", "date": "2013-10-17", "description": "A vineyard within Rome\u2019s city limits is back in business."}
