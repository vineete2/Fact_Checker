Over 18 years of marriage, they learned they wanted to spend their time differently from each other. They divorced after Ms. Hess fell for another man. The couple did not have children, but now Mr. Hummer, who remarried and is now stepfather to two girls, find he loves being a \u201cbonus\u201d dad.         \n\n \n June 8, 1991, to April 28, 2009.         \n\n \n He: 23, She: 31.         \n\n \n She is a human resources manager consultant. He has been a health care manager, restaurant owner and now works for a homebuilder.         \n\n \n         \n\nHe: Rural Pennsylvania, on a family homestead.         \n\nShe: Bexley, Ohio.         \n\n \n         \n\nHe: Very romantic at heart. He was searching for a partner and believed he had met the woman he would spend the rest of his life with.         \n\nShe: She saw the potential for a good partnership and thought they complemented each other well. She was introverted; he was extroverted.         \n\n \n         \n\nBriefly in Harrisburg and central Pennsylvania, and then rural Pennsylvania on his family\u2019s land.         \n\n \n         \n\nOpposites attracted. He found her worldly (she was eight years older), attractive, creative, a great conversationalist about politics and women\u2019s rights. He admired her artistic skills; she painted beautiful watercolors.         \n\nShe found him funny, and enthusiastic whether cooking dinner or building furniture. She respected his fearlessness in facing big projects, whether baling hay or building a barn. He was popular and outgoing.         \n\n \n         \n\nFor 10 years after they married, they volunteered at the Methodist church camp. where they had met. Neither wanted children. Both were moderate politically, but were headed in different directions on the political spectrum though they didn\u2019t know it at the time.         \n\n \n         \n\nHe: There was no \u201caha\u201d moment. He thought their relationship \u201cquirky and unconventional\u201d because they often did their own thing, including taking separate vacations. Increasingly he found himself attending family functions on his own. Though it bothered him, he adapted and didn\u2019t think it warranted divorce.         \n\nShe: Having built their house on his family\u2019s land, over time she felt stifled by living so close to his relatives and also by their social demands. \u201cFor every invitation I declined, four more appeared,\u201d she said. He would get up at 4 a.m. for coffee with his father before work. Ten years into the marriage, on returning from a solo vacation she felt a \u201ctinge\u201d of dread. It surprised her.         \n\n \n         \n\nHe: Less time together magnified their differences; he loved old cars and motorcycles; she painted, read and hiked.         \n\nShe: His family\u2019s conservative politics played a part. She wrote a letter to the local paper supporting gay rights. Though he agreed with her opinion, he asked her to keep her views to herself to maintain peace in the family. She began to feel isolated and believed he was more aligned and closer to his family than he was to her.         \n\nWhen she learned her family carried the gene for Huntington\u2019s disease, she was hit hard. Though she tested negative for the disease, she started to question her choices.         \n\n \n         \n\nWhen the two took a European cruise, she met a professor 30 years her senior. He became a friend to both of them. She didn\u2019t act on it, but after they began an e-mail correspondence, she felt an attraction.         \n\nShe: She felt she had met someone who understood her and what she was seeking from life.         \n\nHe: When she started spending lots of time e-mailing and conversing with their new friend, he felt threatened.         \n\n \n         \n\nThere were long talks about the relationship. They were no longer making decisions together. They saw a counselor.         \n\nHe: After a few sessions of couple\u2019s counseling, he saw the therapist by himself. He thought the counselor believed the relationship wasn\u2019t salvageable and was preparing him for divorce.
