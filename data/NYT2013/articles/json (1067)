{"headline": "Target Struck in the Cat-and-Mouse Game of Credit Theft", "body": "\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Target may have been an easy bull\u2019s-eye for criminal hackers intent on stealing credit card information, but the theft of records for 40 million store customers was hardly the worst security breach among big retailers in recent years. And the incident revealed on Thursday is unlikely to be the last.         \n\nSecurity experts say the Target hack is a reminder of security problems facing many retailers that won\u2019t easily go away: There are weaknesses in the way payment information travels between retailers and banks. There is plenty of money to be made on the black market selling stolen credit card numbers, which can go for as little as a quarter or as much as $45 each. And American companies have been reluctant to adopt smart-chip cards, a type of credit card widely used in Europe that provides better security.         \n\nTarget said that from Nov. 27 to Dec. 15 hackers stole customer names, credit or debit card numbers, expiration dates and three-digit security codes for 40 million customers who had shopped in its stores. It is currently working with a forensic team from Verizon to investigate the breach, according to one person involved in the inquiry. But there was no word as to who was behind the attack, how they got in, or what the total cost to Target may be. Thursday, visitors to the retailer\u2019s website found a site festooned in red and green save for  \n at the top. Complicating matters, Target was hit during the holiday shopping season, when fraud detection systems have a hard enough time telling legitimate transactions from fake ones.         \n\n\u201cThis is the perfect storm\u201d for vulnerability to hackers, said Paul Kocher, president of Cryptography Research, a company that develops technologies to prevent fraud.         \n\nIt may be of little comfort to its customers, but the Target hack was dwarfed by a similar break-in six years ago at T. J. Maxx, which resulted in stolen data for 90 million customers, and a breach of the card processor Heartland Payment Systems in 2009 \u2014 the biggest on record \u2014 which resulted in 130 million stolen card numbers.         \n\nSecurity experts said that even if Target had installed the most cutting-edge security \u2014 and it\u2019s not clear how Target was protecting this data \u2014 it would not be shocking if hackers found a way in.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a game of cat and mouse,\u201d said Steven M. Elefant, a managing director of Soaring Ventures, who was chief security officer at Heartland Payment Systems when it was breached in 2009. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with sophisticated bad guys that have many ways to attack.\u201d         \n\nMr. Elefant said the Heartland breach should have been a wake-up call to large financial institutions and retailers that they needed to increase defenses and encrypt data as it moved from the cash register to card issuers and banks. But hackers, at least, do not appear to be dissuaded by whatever changes retailers have made since then.         \n\nTarget has not said how its systems were compromised and a spokeswoman declined to say whether the company\u2019s point-of-sale systems had been encrypted. Mr. Elefant said, however, that most systems still transmit credit and debit card data \u201cin the clear,\u201d security speak for plain text without encryption that can easily be intercepted.         \n\nWhen shoppers pay for store purchases with credit cards, their payment data moves from the store\u2019s terminal through the retailer\u2019s network to the acquiring bank and credit card issuer. \u201cAt every hop it could be vulnerable,\u201d said Mr. Kocher. \u201cThere have been attacks at every stop along the way.\u201d         \n\nEven when the data is encrypted, experts say there are plenty of other weak spots criminals can target. \u201cCash registers used to be just cash registers,\u201d said Dan Kaminsky, the chief scientist at White Ops, a security consulting company. Today, they are computers of sorts, as vulnerable to hackers as a PC.         \n\nAnd those hackers do have an incentive. Credit and debit card numbers often sell in bulk on black market websites. Platinum cards can fetch as much as $35 and corporate cards $45. That stolen data \u2014 someone\u2019s financial identity \u2014 can be burned onto magnetic strips on counterfeit cards that can be used for fraudulent purchases, or to buy gift cards that can be exchanged for cash.         \n\nExperts also question why \u2014 with breaches recurring regularly and credit card fraud rampant \u2014 American credit card issuers have not embraced smart-chip technology. The United States accounts for more than 47 percent of global credit card fraud, while generating only 24 percent of card spending, according to the Nilson Report, a card industry newsletter. More than 80 countries around the world use chip technology, but less than 1 percent of credit cards in the United States have chips.         \n\nUnlike magnetic-stripe credit cards, which serve the same data every time they are swiped, chip cards offer a different encrypted mathematical value, making it harder for criminals to use stolen data for future purchases.         \n\n\u201cThe U.S. is the only world region where counterfeit fraud continues to rise,\u201d said David Robertson, the Nilson Report publisher. The absence of this chip technology at the physical point of sale is a large contributing factor, he added.         \n\nEurope started migrating to chip cards in 2002, when Europay, MasterCard and Visa partnered on a standard for chip technology. In 2005, the card companies also shifted liability for fraud to merchants in cases where they accepted a fraudulent payment from a magnetic-stripe card, instead of a chip card. As adoption of chip cards increased, fraud levels in Europe, which peaked in 2008, began to decline, according to Euromonitor International, a research company.         \n\n\u201cThe U.S. is still the only market using these 1960s magnetic-stripe cards,\u201d said Mr. Kocher.         \n\nLast year, major credit card companies, including Visa and MasterCard, set October 2015 as the date that merchants will be subjected to new chip card standards, which shift the burden for fraudulent magnetic-stripe transactions from issuers to merchants.         \n\nIt is unclear whether Target\u2019s breach will accelerate the process. Seth Eisen, a spokesman for MasterCard, said the decision to move to the more secure cards will continue to be made by each card company and merchants.         \n\nIn the meantime, breaches continue.         \n\n\u201cThe most important thing to realize is that 500 of the Fortune 500 are under constant attack,\u201d said Mr. Kaminsky. \u201cNobody should be saying \u2018I can\u2019t believe Target got attacked\u2019 because the reality is that everybody is getting attacked.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/20/technology/target-stolen-shopper-data.html", "date": "2013-12-19", "description": "The theft is the latest blow struck in a technological cat-and-mouse game between retailers and criminals, who experts say can attack along a wide variety of avenues."}
