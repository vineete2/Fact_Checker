{"headline": "A Fine Line for Activists in Russia", "body": "\nLONDON \u2014 They likened the beginnings of their enforced odyssey to something between an action movie and an episode from the Cold War. They spoke of icy, sunless cells and the diurnal grind of detention. \u201cBeing in prison is like slowly dying,\u201d one of them said.         \n\nAlmost two months after armed Russian coast guards abseiled from a hovering helicopter to take control of their  \n protest vessel, 28 climate change activists and two freelance journalists were transferred by rail this week from Murmansk to St. Petersburg, an 800-mile journey in a Russian prison car.         \n\nIn activist shorthand, they had become known as the  \n 30. What began as the attempted scaling of an offshore  \n platform in the Pechora Sea operated by the state energy giant Gazprom had been transformed into a far harsher prospect: charged first with piracy, then with hooliganism, the group could now face seven years in prison, joining such other emblems of Moscow\u2019s iron hand as the Pussy Riot rock band and the former tycoon Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky.         \n\nFrom California to London, the families of the protesters, drawn from 18 nations, pleaded for their release. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect this in my life again,\u201d Pavel Litvinov, 73, told The Los Angeles Times, speaking of his son Dima, 51, one of the detainees, and recalling his own history of banishment to Siberia before the family emigrated to America in 1974.         \n\nBut, perhaps less obviously, the arrests seemed to raise the question of whether anyone should have been surprised about the outcome of venturing into an area that President Vladmir V. Putin regards as a strategic imperative. \u201cThere is so much that is unknown,\u201d Lara Litvinov, the elder Mr. Litvinov\u2019s daughter, said, \u201cand the Russian government is so unpredictable.\u201d         \n\nThe uncertainty, indeed, infused the treatment of the activists aboard the Arctic Sunrise. Last year, in a similar protest at the same drilling rig, Greenpeace activists, including Kumi Naidoo, the head of the organization, unfurled banners, made videos and were allowed to proceed on their way unscathed.         \n\nThe experience, Mr. Naidoo said in an interview, weighed in the considerations of the latest protest. \u201cWhen we planned this action,\u201d he said, the questions the group asked included, \u201cHas the context changed?\u201d         \n\n\u201cAnd the context had changed\u201d with a series of gestures by President Putin that could have been read \u201cas a global charm offensive.\u201d Just one example, Mr. Naidoo said, was an Op-Ed article by Mr. Putin in The New York Times in September, in which he committed himself to international law, criticizing America for threatening military intervention in Syria. \u201cThe law is still the law,\u201d Mr. Putin wrote, \u201cand we must follow it whether we like it or not.\u201d         \n\nBut the law had different connotations for the Arctic Sunrise, boarded in international waters and \u201coutside the exclusion zone\u201d around the drilling rig, Mr. Naidoo said. \u201cThe only law we broke was the trespass law, which carries a fine,\u201d Mr. Naidoo said, speaking by telephone from Johannesburg.         \n\nMovements like Greenpeace walk a narrow line, harvesting publicity for their cause from protests while seeking to maintain credibility with an array of constituencies \u2014 \u201cinvestors and people who have the capability to get Gazprom to rethink,\u201d Mr. Naidoo said.         \n\nIn Britain, Prime Minister David Cameron has sought to intercede with President Putin on behalf of the activists, who include six Britons. But diplomacy finds limited space to maneuver in the ever more abrupt collision between the urge to exploit dwindling resources and the activists\u2019 struggle to preserve them, tilting against Big Energy along the way.         \n\n\u201cRight now we have to ask the question: What\u2019s the level of sacrifice we are prepared to accept?\u201d said Mr. Naidoo, an alumnus of South Africa\u2019s anti-apartheid struggle. \u201cThe stakes are high and are going to get higher, and as the stakes get higher, the risk gets higher.\u201d And in the standoff with Moscow, \u201cwe will not be cowed.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIf the Russian government thought they were going to silence us\u201d through acts of intimidation, he said, \u201cI would beg them to reconsider.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/15/world/europe/a-fine-line-for-activists-in-russia.html", "date": "2013-11-14", "description": "The Arctic protesters are joining such other emblems of Moscow\u2019s iron hand as the Pussy Riot rock band and the former tycoon Mikhail B.
