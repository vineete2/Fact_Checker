{"headline": "Wine Pairings for a Vegan Meal", "body": "\nThe best wines for these vegan lunch and dinner dishes come from the Mediterranean-style repertory: dry ros\u00e9s, crisp whites, earthy reds.         \n\nThe more important question is whether you want a vegan wine, too. Many people are not aware that wines may be clarified, or fined, with products derived from animals. This process may use ingredients like egg whites or isinglass (derived from fish bladders) to remove minute particles from the wine. These fining agents are then removed, but trace elements may remain, ruling out the wines for vegans.         \n\nHow can you tell if a wine is vegan? Some wines may not be fined, or may be fined with a clay-based ingredient like bentonite. But it is difficult to know for sure unless a wine is labeled \u201cunfined,\u201d or includes an ingredients list. Few wines list ingredients, but producers like Ridge, Bonny Doon Vineyard and Shinn Estate are leading the way. And their wines are very good.\u00a0        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/18/dining/wine-pairings-for-a-vegan-meal.html", "date": "2013-09-17", "description": "Dry ros\u00e9s, crisp whites, earthy reds."}
