{"headline": "In Rodriguez Arbitration, Two Sides Play Hardball", "body": "\nA trainer for  \n was shopping in Times Square with his wife and three young children one recent Saturday when he was followed into Toys \u201cR\u201d Us. A man working on behalf of Major League Baseball approached and handed him some paperwork. It was a subpoena to testify against Mr. Rodriguez.         \n\nInvestigators working for Mr. Rodriguez, meanwhile, had a target of their own. They had received a tip that Robert D. Manfred, the league\u2019s second-in-command behind Commissioner  \n, had apparently been speaking indiscreetly about Mr. Rodriguez during a round of golf at Manhattan Woods Golf Club in West Nyack, N.Y. Enticed by the lead, Mr. Rodriguez\u2019s investigators tracked down a caddie to learn what Mr. Manfred had said.         \n\nIn the nine months since Mr. Rodriguez and more than a dozen other players were linked to a South Florida anti-aging clinic that is believed to have distributed banned substances to professional athletes, baseball officials and the Yankee third baseman have engaged in a cloak-and-dagger struggle surpassing anything the sport has seen. The extraordinary investigative tactics, playing out in multiple locations, reflect Major League Baseball\u2019s resolve to prove one of its stars cheated, and that player\u2019s determination to discredit baseball officials.         \n\nWitnesses for both sides in the pending arbitration proceedings claim to have been harassed and threatened. Some were paid tens of thousands of dollars for their cooperation. One said she became intimately involved with an investigator on the case. And some witness accounts have shifted, leaving each side scrambling to defend the sometimes inconsistent stories provided by former employees and associates of the now-defunct clinic, Biogenesis of America.         \n\nThe dispute \u2014 which involves lawsuits in Florida and in New York, and a battle over grand jury transcripts in Buffalo \u2014 has become so extensive that Major League Baseball has once again turned to its go-to consultant for complicated problems, the former senator George J. Mitchell, whose law firm is assisting with the growing caseload.         \n\nThese details have been gleaned from dozens of interviews conducted by The New York Times over several months with witnesses, current and former law enforcement officials and lawyers involved in all sides of the dispute, and from documents obtained by The Times relating to M.L.B.\u2019s case against Mr. Rodriguez, as well as police reports and lawsuits. Several witnesses and lawyers insisted on anonymity when discussing any aspect of the case because they have been ordered not to speak about the matter by the independent arbitrator who is hearing Mr. Rodriguez\u2019s appeal of his 211-game doping suspension stemming from the Florida clinic investigation.         \n\nWhat is driving the battle on one side is a scorned player desperately trying to expose a process he considers unfair to him. On the other side are baseball officials who believe Mr. Rodriguez has been getting away with doping violations for years. According to people involved with baseball\u2019s antidoping program, he failed a drug test for stimulants in 2006, a previously undisclosed charge.         \n\nMr. Rodriguez\u2019s formal appeal, which is being heard in a confidential arbitration proceeding, is on break until Nov. 18.         \n\nThe ferocity of the fight reflects a personal stake for the main protagonists.         \n\nMr. Selig, 79, plans to retire at the end of next season, with his legacy in the balance. In his 21 years leading Major League Baseball, he has been criticized for failing to confront rampant doping. In his later years, has pushed aggressively against drug cheaters.         \n\n\u201cOur Biogenesis investigation led to 13 players being disciplined without challenge,\u201d Mr. Selig said Sunday. \u201cOnly one player challenged and attacked every part of the process, and I believe it says more about his misconduct than it does about any alleged behavior by our investigators.\u201d         \n\nMr. Rodriguez, 38, who said he used performance-enhancing drugs only from 2001 to 2003, when there were no penalties, is battling for his reputation and his $275 million contract with the  \n that runs through 2017.         \n\nHe declined to comment for this article.         \n\nA representative for Mr. Rodriguez\u2019s legal team, Lanny J. Davis,\u00a0said M.L.B.\u2019s handling of the investigation \u201cis not just unseemly, it is shameful.\u201d He accused the league of using \u201cimproper investigative tactics.\u201d         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/04/sports/baseball/in-rodriguez-arbitration-two-sides-play-hardball.html", "date": "2013-11-03", "description": "In the months since several players were linked to a Florida anti-aging clinic, Major League Baseball and Alex Rodriguez have engaged in a cloak-and-dagger struggle surpassing anything the sport has seen."}
