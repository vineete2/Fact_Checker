Files Lawsuit Seeking to Stop the Collection of Domestic Phone Logs", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The  \n sued the Obama administration on Tuesday over its \u201cdragnet\u201d collection of logs of domestic phone calls, contending that the once-secret program \u2014  \n last week by a former  \n contractor \u2014 is illegal and asking a judge to stop it and order the records purged.         \n\nThe lawsuit could set up an eventual Supreme Court test. It could also focus attention on this disclosure amid the larger heap of top secret surveillance matters revealed by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor who came forward Sunday to say he was their source.         \n\nThe program \u201cgives the government a comprehensive record of our associations and public movements, revealing a wealth of detail about our familial, political, professional, religious and intimate associations,\u201d  \n, adding that it \u201cis likely to have a chilling effect on whistle-blowers and others who would otherwise contact\u201d the A.C.L.U. for legal assistance.         \n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment on the suit.         \n\nIn other lawsuits against national security policies, the government has often persuaded courts to dismiss them without ruling on the merits by arguing that litigation  \n or that the plaintiffs  \n and so lacked standing in court.         \n\nThis case may be different. The government has now  \n the existence of the program. And the A.C.L.U. is a customer of Verizon Business Network Services \u2014 the recipient of a leaked secret court order for all its domestic calling records \u2014 which it says gives it standing.         \n\nThe call logging program keeps a record of \u201cmetadata\u201d from domestic phone calls, including which numbers were dialed and received, from which location, and the time and duration.         \n\nThe effort began as part of the Bush administration\u2019s post-Sept. 11 programs of  \n, which has continued since 2006 with the blessing of a national security court. The court has secretly ruled that bulk surveillance is authorized by a section of the  \n that allows the F.B.I. to obtain \u201cbusiness records\u201d relevant to a counterterrorism investigation.         \n\nCongress never openly voted to authorize the collection of logs of hundreds of millions of domestic calls, but some lawmakers were secretly briefed. Some members of Congress have backed the program as a useful counterterrorism tool; others have denounced it.         \n\n\u201cThe administration claims authority to sift through details of our private lives because the Patriot Act says that it can,\u201d Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., Republican of Wisconsin,  \n to Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. \u201cI disagree. I authored the Patriot Act, and this is an abuse of that law.\u201d         \n\nOver the weekend, James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, said that officials may access the database only if they can meet a legal justification \u2014 \u201creasonable suspicion, based on specific facts, that the particular basis for the query is associated with a foreign terrorist organization.\u201d Queries are audited under the oversight of the national security court.         \n\nTimothy Edgar, a former civil liberties official on intelligence matters in the Bush and Obama administrations who worked on building safeguards into the phone log program, said the notion underlying the limits was that people\u2019s privacy is not invaded by having their records collected, but only when a human examines them.         \n\n\u201cWhen you have important reasons why that collection needs to take place on a scale that is much larger than case-by-case or individual obtaining of records,\u201d he said, \u201cthen one of the ways you try to deal with the privacy issue is you think carefully about having a set of safeguards that basically say, \u2018O.K., yes, this has major privacy implications, but what can we do on the back end to address those?\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nStill, privacy advocates say the existence of the database will erode the sense of living in a free society: whenever Americans pick up a phone, they now face the consideration of whether they want the record of that call to go into the government\u2019s files.         \n\nMoreover, while use of the database is now limited to terrorism, history has shown that new government powers granted for one purpose often end up applied to others. An expanded search warrant authority justified by the Sept. 11 attacks, for example,  \n like suspected drug, fraud and tax offenses.         \n\nExecutive branch officials and lawmakers who support the program have hinted that some terrorist plots have been foiled by using the database. In private conversations, they have also explained that investigators start with a phone number linked to terrorism, and scrutinize the ring of people who have called that number \u2014 and other people who in turn called those \u2014 in an effort to identify co-conspirators.         \n\nStill, that analysis may generally be performed without a wholesale sweep of call records, since investigators can instead use subpoenas to obtain relevant logs from telephone companies. Senators Ron Wyden of Oregon and Mark Udall of Colorado, two Democrats who have examined it in classified Senate Intelligence Committee hearings,  \n that the evidence is thin that the program provided uniquely available intelligence.         \n\nBut supporters privately say the database\u2019s existence is about more than convenience and speed. They say it can also help in searching for networks of terrorists who are taking steps to shield their communications from detection by using different phones to call one another. If calls from a different number are being made from the same location as calls by the number that was already known to be suspicious, having the entire database may be helpful in a way that subpoenas for specific numbers cannot match.         \n\nIt remains unclear, however, whether there have been any real-world instances in which a terrorist was identified in that way, or whether that advantage is to date only theoretical.         \n\nA 1979 ruling over small-scale collection of calling metadata held that such records were not protected by the Fourth Amendment privacy rights since people have revealed such information to phone companies. In a 2012 case involving GPS trackers, however, the Supreme Court suggested that the long-term, automated collection of people\u2019s public movements might raise Fourth Amendment issues.
