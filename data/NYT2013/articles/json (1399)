{"headline": "Universe as an Infant: Fatter Than Expected and Kind of Lumpy", "body": "\nAstronomers released the latest and most exquisite baby picture yet of the universe on Thursday, one that showed it to be 80 million to 100 million years older and a little fatter than previously thought, with more matter in it and perhaps ever so slightly lopsided.         \n\nRecorded by the European Space Agency\u2019s Planck satellite, the image is a heat map of the cosmos as it appeared only 370,000 years after the Big Bang, showing space speckled with faint spots from which galaxies would grow over billions of years.         \n\nThe map, the Planck team said in news conferences and in 29 papers  \n Thursday, is in stunning agreement with the general view of the universe that has emerged over the past 20 years, of a cosmos dominated by mysterious  \n that seems to be pushing space apart and the almost-as-mysterious  \n that is pulling galaxies together. It also shows a universe that seems to have endured an explosive burp known as inflation, which was the dynamite in the Big Bang.         \n\nIn a statement issued by the European Space Agency, Jean-Jacques Dordain, its director general, said, \u201cThe extraordinary quality of Planck\u2019s portrait of the infant universe allows us to peel back its layers to the very foundations, revealing that our blueprint of the cosmos is far from complete.\u201d         \n\nWithin the standard cosmological framework, however, the new satellite data underscored the existence of puzzling anomalies that may yet lead theorists back to the drawing board. The universe appears to be slightly lumpier, with bigger and more hot and cold spots in the northern half of the sky as seen from Earth than toward the south, for example. And there is a large, unexplained cool spot in the northern hemisphere.         \n\nThose anomalies had shown up on previous maps by NASA\u2019s  \n, or WMAP, satellite, but some had argued that they were because of a bad analysis or contamination from the Milky Way.         \n\nNow cosmologists will have to take them more seriously, said Max Tegmark, an expert on the early universe at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was not part of the Planck team. He described the new results as \u201cvery exciting.\u201d It could be, he said, that \u201cthe universe is trying to tell us something.\u201d         \n\nGeorge Efstathiou, of Cambridge University, one of the leaders of the Planck project, said in the European Space Agency news release: \u201cOur ultimate goal would be to construct a new model that predicts the anomalies and links them together. But these are early days; so far, we don\u2019t know whether this is possible and what type of new physics might be needed. And that\u2019s exciting.\u201d         \n\nThe Planck satellite was launched in 2009 and has been scanning the sky ever since, recording the faint variations in a haze of radio microwaves that fill the sky.         \n\nMicrowaves are a form of electromagnetic radiation used in the kitchen for heating leftovers; that they are important for cosmology was discovered by accident back in 1965 by a pair of Bell Labs radio astronomers, Arno Penzias and Robert W. Wilson, who later won the  \n. Using balloons, a U-2 spy plane and a series of satellites like the WMAP, astronomers have been teasing out the detailed features of this radiation.         \n\nThe microwaves detected by the Planck date from 370,000 years after the Big Bang, which is as far back as optical or radio telescopes will ever be able to see, cosmologists say. But the patterns within them date from less than a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, when the universe is said to have undergone a violent burst of expansion known as inflation that set cosmic history on the course it has followed ever since. Those patterns are Planck\u2019s prize.         \n\nAnalyzing the relative sizes and frequencies of spots and ripples over the years has allowed astronomers to describe the birth of the universe to a precision that would make the philosophers weep. The new data have allowed astronomers to tweak their model a bit. It now seems the universe is 13.8 billion years old, instead of 13.7 billion, and consists by mass of 4.9 percent ordinary matter like atoms, 27 percent dark matter and 68 percent dark energy.         \n\nMarc Kamionkowski, an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University who commented on the work at a news teleconference sponsored by NASA, called Planck \u201ccosmology\u2019s human genome project,\u201d saying, \u201cIt shows the seeds from which the current universe grew.\u201d         \n\nDavid N. Spergel, a Princeton University cosmologist, described the new results as \u201cbeautiful.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThe standard cosmological model looks even stronger today than yesterday,\u201d he said. \u201cThe universe remains simple and strange.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/22/science/space/planck-satellite-shows-image-of-infant-universe.html", "date": "2013-03-21", "description": "A Planck satellite image shows the cosmos as it appeared only 370,000 years after the Big Bang."}
