{"headline": "Feast and Football", "body": "\nTurkey and football have gone together for as long as any fan can remember, and Thanksgiving Day football has been an N.F.L. tradition in Detroit and Dallas since 1934 and 1966. This year, as has been the case since 2006, there will be three games: the Lions will face the Packers, the Cowboys will play the Raiders and, at night, the Steelers will meet the Ravens.         \n\nBut why play on Thanksgiving? It\u2019s not as if the pilgrims tossed around the pigskin postfeast. According to Saleem Choudhry, a researcher at the Pro Football Hall of Fame, in Canton, Ohio, the tradition gained popularity when George Richards, the owner of the Lions, proposed the idea as a publicity gimmick. He was looking to find a way to garner the same type of attention that Detroit\u2019s most popular professional team, the Tigers, enjoyed on the sports pages. Teaming with NBC Radio, the Lions\u2019 game in 1934 was broadcast around the country, and the tradition was born.         \n\nFrom the Times photography archive, the Pro Football Hall of Fame and The Associated Press, we take a look at the ritual. In the early years, the stadiums broadcast a bare-bones elegance. Residential buildings outside the stands seemed to peer between the sections of bleachers, as if elbowing for a better view. Advertisements were few and far between. And the players were smaller back then, too. But weren\u2019t we all?
