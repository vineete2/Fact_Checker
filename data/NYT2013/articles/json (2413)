{"headline": "Council Speaker Recounts Her Struggles With Bulimia and Alcoholism", "body": "\nThe summer she turned 16,  \n\u2019s world seemed to shatter.         \n\nHer mother was dying of breast cancer that had spread to her bones.         \n\nAlmost every morning, the young Ms. Quinn woke her mother, bathed her, made her breakfast and gave her medication.         \n\nHer mother had gone deaf, and said that Christine, her younger daughter, was the only one whose lips she could read. So it was up to her daughter to deliver the worsening medical news the family received in doctors\u2019 offices and hospital rooms, which her mother met with disbelief and sometimes anger.         \n\nWhen the sadness and chaos got to be too much, Ms. Quinn would sneak tubs of ice cream and corn muffins up to her bedroom, eat them in a single sitting, and then make herself throw up. The purging brought a momentary sense of relief to what seemed an out-of-control life.         \n\nMs. Quinn, now speaker of the New York City Council and a Democratic candidate for mayor, kept secretly bingeing and purging for 10 years, as she moved from high school to Trinity College and the beginnings of a political career, until she entered a Florida rehabilitation center at age 26.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m embarrassed about it now still,\u201d Ms. Quinn said during an interview on Friday at her City Hall office. \u201cI wish I could say I wasn\u2019t.\u201d         \n\nNow, for the first time, Ms. Quinn is making public her bulimia and the alcoholism that accompanied it. She will speak about her experience on Tuesday at Barnard College, and touch on it in a memoir to be published next month.         \n\nMs. Quinn, 46, contacted The New York Times to tell her story, as her aides try to soften her often rough-edged political image and build a campaign that draws heavily on her personal appeal to women.         \n\nShe said she had come to believe that \u201cuntil you stop hiding things, you\u2019re hiding things, and hiding things is not healthy.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI just want people to know you can get through stuff,\u201d she added. \u201cI hope people can see that in what my life has been and where it is going.\u201d         \n\nIn the years since she entered politics, Ms. Quinn has spoken at times about her mother\u2019s illness and death, though rarely in as much detail as she did in interviews with The Times on Friday and Saturday, during which her emotions about her past still seemed raw and she teared up several times.         \n\nAnd while she often reminisces about her upbringing, describing herself as the loud, energetic striver in a wisecracking Irish family, it is clear from the interviews that the family had darker shadows too, especially alcoholism and an inability to talk about difficult subjects.         \n\nIn addition to a great-grandfather, a grandmother and a great-uncle who were alcoholics, her mother drank too much, fighting her despondency about cancer with alcohol and tranquilizers.         \n\n\u201cShe would get sad, and she would get frustrated, and she would cry and be very forlorn,\u201d said Ms. Quinn, who has herself stopped drinking in recent years.         \n\n \n         \n\nMs. Quinn was in second grade when her mother, Mary Callaghan Quinn, received a diagnosis of breast cancer and had a mastectomy.         \n\nBut she did not learn about her mother\u2019s illness until she was in eighth grade, when a nun at her Catholic school in Glen Cove, N.Y., told one of her classmates to be extra nice to her because her mother had cancer. When the classmate shared what the nun said, Ms. Quinn at first found it unbelievable; her parents had told her the scar that ran from her mother\u2019s chest to her throat was the result of a bad tooth infection that had spread.         \n\nWhen she told her older sister what the classmate had said, her sister told her the truth. By then her mother was deteriorating rapidly. Ms. Quinn said she believed that, if she could be the perfect daughter \u2014 which, in her teenage sensibility, meant being thinner and prettier, and getting better grades \u2014 her mother might be saved. Around this time, in 10th grade, she overheard girls talking in the locker room about making themselves throw up to lose weight.
