{"headline": "A Ship of Love Passing in the Night. By Day, It\u2019s the Ferry Again.", "body": "\nThe riders eye the outdoor perches first, pressing, grinding, deploying well-placed elbows, angling closer, closer to the edge that overlooks the water.         \n\nSoon there are juice boxes resting on the rail and children on their tiptoes just beneath them. Sisters clink $3.75 Bud Lights in a presunset toast. Some riders wear foam crowns of Lady Liberty, and a German tour group, decked in lederhosen, asks about the statue. It rises soon enough, dutifully obscuring the view of New Jersey.         \n\nBut the Staten Island Ferry on a Saturday night is a love story first, retold every 5.2 miles with many of the same characters \u2014 a 25-minute cruise, as Gay Talese once wrote, for those with \u201cno particular desire to reach the other side.\u201d         \n\nHere are the high school sophomores on a chaperoned date, stealing a kiss \u2014 the gentle clack of orthodontic braces \u2014 as the adults look away.         \n\nThere is Angelo Gonzalez, 55, eating Twizzlers aboard the 7 p.m. ferry to Manhattan, stopping for a moment to peck Lillian Torres, 59, on their way to dinner and a waterside stroll.         \n\n\u201cYou get out of the blah,\u201d Mr. Gonzalez said, explaining the itch to leave Staten Island, to \u201cgo see some bling.\u201d         \n\nAt the back, couples laughed and whispered, serving as their own tour guides. Look at the new World Trade Center tower. Do you see Brooklyn, receding in the wake?         \n\nJim and Talleah McMahon spent part of their fifth wedding anniversary on board, a bit of improvisation from a husband who \u201csort of pretended that I had a plan for today.\u201d         \n\nThey had posted a message on Facebook, asking friends what they might find interesting on their first visit to Staten Island. \u201cNothing yet,\u201d Mr. McMahon said, checking his phone.         \n\nFor the unattached, the ferry presents the first opportunity to find an evening companion.         \n\nIt is the vessel that once attracted a younger Michael R. Bloomberg, spoiling for a place to bring his dates. \u201cYou\u2019d get a six-pack of beer, a pizza, and you\u2019d sit outside,\u201d he recalled in September. \u201cIt was really romantic.\u201d         \n\nThe fare was a nickel then. Now the ride is free.         \n\nAnd the drinks are cheap.         \n\nOn the deck near dusk, Amanda Gough, 26, traveled alone, holding the book \u201cA Game of Thrones\u201d in her right hand and a 25.4-ounce Foster\u2019s beer in her left, to be completed, per ritual, before reaching Manhattan for a night out with friends. \u201cThat\u2019s the challenge,\u201d she said. She is undefeated.         \n\nOn the 10 p.m. ferry, riders completed a streak of 19 consecutive beer orders in the ferry\u2019s food and beverage area. A woman seeking popcorn broke the run, which was equaled on the 11 p.m. ferry, before a water order felled momentum.         \n\nBy this time of night, clubgoers predominated, particularly on trips from Staten Island to Manhattan, the rows a kaleidoscope of cheetah print, high heels, higher heels and assorted renderings of the Italian flag.         \n\nThere is a line of seats in front of a mirror in the women\u2019s bathroom, primed for primping; the men\u2019s room has no such trappings, though there are locks on the rolls of toilet paper, lest a free ride become a profitable one for the sticky-fingered.         \n\nThis was the hour of the bachelor pep talk, for those who would soon attempt perhaps New York City\u2019s unlikeliest nightclub maneuver: selling a potential mate on a trip to Staten Island with a stranger. \u201cBro, bro, only 9s and 10s tonight,\u201d one rider advised a friend as they boarded.         \n\nSeveral travelers \u2014 who wished to remain anonymous for reasons that included being a police officer, compromising the Google search results for their names and \u201ctrying to be a teacher\u201d \u2014 said their ambitions for the evening were simple: \u201cget messed up,\u201d or a coarser variation, and get lucky.         \n\nBut during their rides home hours later, some revelers were more subdued. On the 1:30 a.m. ferry, a bachelorette party had grown from three to five since 9 p.m., its inspiration dressed in a silver sash. And yet the group sat quietly, disinclined to reminisce. The evening was fine, the bride said. Just fine.         \n\nNearby, the men of Staten Island, mateless still, arrived at their last gasps, like fatigued pitchers whose sharpest curveballs have already been thrown.         \n\n\u201cHow\u2019s your boyfriend?\u201d one asked, the stench of alcohol sailing through the cabin. A woman whose shirt was knotted at her midriff, cursed and walked off.         \n\nNo matter, the man said, insulting her measurements.         \n\nAnd yet, romance was never far off. Gabriel Jouard, 24, and Stephanie Santiago, 23, had been sitting outside earlier, staring at the fading skyline. On Ms. Santiago\u2019s lap sat a pitbull-chihuahua mix named Olive, who wore a collar of white rope because \u201cwe\u2019re broke,\u201d Ms. Santiago said.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never had a date,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just spend every day with each other.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/29/nyregion/ferried-between-islands-toward-love-and-its-promise.html", "date": "2013-06-28", "description": "The Staten Island Ferry on a Saturday night is a romance retold every 5.2 miles with stolen kisses, drinks overlooking the water and many of the same characters."}
