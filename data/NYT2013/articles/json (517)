Now, despite continuing budgetary challenges, districts are re-envisioning summer school as something more than a compulsory exercise where students who need to make up lost credits fight to stay awake inside humid classrooms.         \n\nAccording to the National Summer Learning Association, a nonprofit group, 25 of the country\u2019s largest school districts \u2014 including Charlotte, N.C.; Cincinnati; Oakland, Calif.; Pittsburgh; and Providence, R.I. \u2014 have developed summer school programs that move beyond the traditional remedial model. The New York City public schools offer several summer programs that mingle enrichment with academics, including an intensive arts institute and a vocational program combining course work and paid internships.         \n\nHere in Jacksonville, the academic year ended three weeks ago, but Roshelle Campbell drove into the parking lot of Sallye B. Mathis Elementary School on a recent scorching morning to drop off her son, Gregory Carodine, for a full day of classes.         \n\nGregory is one of more than 300 students spending six weeks of his summer vacation at Mathis \u2014 not because he failed an exam or a class, but because educators in the Duval County Public Schools fret that too many children are at risk of falling behind during the summer.         \n\n\u201cHe has always been so smart,\u201d Ms. Campbell, a security guard, said of Gregory, 6, who will start first grade in the fall. \u201cI felt like education is really important, and I really don\u2019t want him to lose that during the summer time.\u201d         \n\nEven in districts with severe fiscal woes, like Baltimore, Chicago, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and San Francisco, education officials have enlisted the support of philanthropic organizations that believe keeping children, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, in school during the summer may help level the playing field for poor and more affluent students.         \n\n\u201cI know that there are students that attend public schools who are in Europe right now, and there are kids who are participating in a soccer camp,\u201d said Nikolai Vitti, superintendent of the Duval County Public Schools, which has quadrupled the number of voluntary summer slots it offers in the past five years. \u201cI think that\u2019s healthy. But I think what we should be talking about as a country is, do all of our children have access and opportunities to do that so they are not sitting at home, waking up at 11 in the morning, eating doughnuts and watching cartoons? That\u2019s a reality for some of our kids.\u201d         \n\nInstead, educators are increasingly viewing summer as a time to bolster the material that children, including both strong performers and struggling students, learn throughout the regular school year. Along with reading, math and science instruction, the districts are packing the summer schedule with activities like art and music; classes in forensic science and marine biology; sailing, fencing and karate lessons; and field trips to museums and theaters.         \n\n \n has shown that students regress during the summer, losing an average of about one month of instruction per year, with the so-called summer slide disproportionately affecting low-income children. The lack of high-quality summer programs can also hurt working families whose children have few options during the long months off.         \n\nEnhanced summer school \u201cshould be part of public education until we recognize that the traditional school calendar doesn\u2019t fit the way Americans live anymore,\u201d said Harris M. Cooper, a professor of education at Duke University who has studied summer learning loss. \u201cAdding 20 days to the school year and having multiple short breaks rather than the one long break actually fits better with the way families live and the way kids learn.\u201d         \n\nIn an effort to evaluate what kinds of programs produce better academic results, the Wallace Foundation, a private charitable organization, has committed $50 million to study summer schooling in Jacksonville and several other urban districts, including in Boston, Dallas, Pittsburgh and Rochester, N.Y. Beginning this summer, researchers from the RAND Corporation are following about 5,700 students in those cities who will enter fourth grade this fall.
