{"headline": "My Face Is Stuck in the \u201970s", "body": "\nI don\u2019t wear makeup, and by that I don\u2019t mean what most women mean when they make that claim, which is that they don\u2019t wear  \n make-up.         \n\n\u201cI just use a little blush,\u201d they will explain, or \u201cjust a hint of lipstick.\u201d         \n\nOr as my sister puts it, \u201cGod forgot to make my eyelids purple, so I\u2019m just helping him out.\u201d         \n\nI actually wear no makeup at all, and apart from the usual seventh grader sneaking out of the house in mom\u2019s mascara, and a some ninth-grade experimentation with those groovy Yardley cosmetics they advertised on \u201cThe Monkees,\u201d (I longed to make Peter Tork swoon) I never have.         \n\nWhen it\u2019s time to leave the house, I never need a minute to run to the bathroom to \u201cfix my face.\u201d         \n\nI think my face is just fine the way it is.         \n\nAt 58, I\u2019m the only woman I know who doesn\u2019t even own a lipstick. How did this happen? I\u2019m not some kind of radical firebrand. I\u2019m a mild-mannered librarian. I\u2019m bookish, not hyperbolic.         \n\nSo why no eyeliner?         \n\nIt certainly isn\u2019t my mom\u2019s fault. My elegant mother never left the house without makeup. And not just a hint. The whole nine yards: foundation, powder, blush, lipstick, eye shadow, eyeliner and, usually, mascara.         \n\nAs a little girl, I spent hours watching my beautiful mother \u201cpaint her face.\u201d         \n\nWhen mom went out, she always looked like a million bucks, even if she was just headed to the supermarket. She looked like a million bucks when she came downstairs for breakfast each morning. She couldn\u2019t enjoy even a sip of morning coffee before she had applied her lipstick. (Lipstick-stained coffee cups were a motif of my childhood.)         \n\nWith a role model like this, how did I end up being a woman with a naked face?         \n\nFor one thing, I couldn\u2019t help but notice how much easier it always was for dad to get ready. When we left the house, my father never needed that extra minute to run to the bathroom to fix his face.         \n\nTime to go? O.K., let\u2019s go.         \n\nTo me, as a child, it was a puzzle.         \n\nIf his face was O.K. without being \u201cfixed,\u201d why wasn\u2019t hers?         \n\nThen, just as I hit adolescence, along came the women\u2019s movement. Thank goddess for feminism, with its emphasis on who we were inside rather than on how beautifully we were packaged.         \n\nJettison the lipstick, toss the bra, fight for equality and change the world.         \n\nIt was not only totally cool for a young feminist to go without \u201cwar paint,\u201d it was also almost de rigueur.         \n\nShunning cosmetics was also a nifty way for me, as teenage girls often do, to drive my mother nuts. Mom had geared herself up for conflict about my wanting to wear too much makeup too soon. But that a daughter of hers would refuse to use it at all? Unthinkable!         \n\nThe fresh-faced feminists I ran with in my youth, now that they\u2019ve reached their 50s and 60s, no longer bat an eyelash when it comes to applying a touch of eyeliner. But I guess I\u2019m still stuck in the \u201870s, because I continue to believe that I look just as good with a naked face as I would with makeup. In fact, I believe that most women do.         \n\nIn those ubiquitous women\u2019s magazine makeover articles, I always prefer the \u201cbefore\u201d photos.         \n\nA naked face has character. A glamour shot is just a mask.         \n\nBecause plenty of guys actually prefer kissing lips that aren\u2019t slick with gloss, I\u2019ve never had trouble finding men who were attracted to me. (Once, a guy I\u2019d been going out with revealed, after a few drinks, that he was a secret cross-dresser. While I was O.K. with dating a dude who wore more makeup than I did, at least behind closed doors, he was bummed to learn that I didn\u2019t have a thing to teach him about choosing the right lipstick.)         \n\nIn my 40s, I edited a series of humor books. For my author photo, the publisher insisted on booking a salon professional to do my hair and makeup before the photo shoot.         \n\nA team player, I went along.         \n\nA week later, my author photo arrived in the mail, a glamour shot showing me salon-coifed, with a wide smile plastered on my face, made-up to the max.         \n\nMy 5-year-old son took one look at it and burst out laughing.         \n\n(Mom, of course, would have been thrilled.)         \n\nTo this day, that photo makes me cringe. Who is that strange, smiling glamour-puss? It ain\u2019t me, babe. I vowed that I\u2019d never wear \u201cwar paint\u201d again.         \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t. Until last August, when I appeared on the \u201cToday\u201d show.         \n\nWhen I arrived (in a limo) at 30 Rock at 7 in the morning, I was whisked off to \u201chair and makeup,\u201d where they gave me the works, from burgundy lipstick to serious mascara. My face covered with glamorous gunk, I rejoined my sister in the green room to wait for my segment. When she saw me, she didn\u2019t burst out laughing. But she did smirk.         \n\n\u201cIs it that bad?\u201d I asked.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s garish,\u201d she said. \u201cBut, onscreen, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be O.K.\u201d         \n\nAnd it was. Although I\u2019d never been on national television (or anything remotely like that) I looked like I belonged there.         \n\nShould I have stuck to my guns and refused to wear makeup? Of course not! Being a pale face in that context wouldn\u2019t just be nutty, it would be rude.         \n\nBesides, all the men on set wore makeup, too.         \n\nDid the compliments I ended up getting from the folks who had seen me onscreen make me want to start using a little lipstick? And perhaps a touch of eyeliner? (God, apparently, neglected to make my eyelids purple as well.)         \n\nNot a chance. It all comes down to fairness. It\u2019s just wrong that men look just fine the way they are, but we women are encouraged to believe we don\u2019t look good enough unless we \u201cfix\u201d our faces.         \n\nWill I ever change my mind? Maybe when linebackers start wearing lipstick.
