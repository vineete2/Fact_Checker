{"headline": "Republicans in Arizona Are at Odds on Medicaid", "body": "\nPHOENIX \u2014 For Gov. Jan Brewer, the  \n last month of a Medicaid expansion was a major coup. Despite a Republican majority in the Legislature, where she faced significant opposition from Tea Party members, she rallied the entire Democratic delegation to her side and made a progressive issue palatable to just enough conservatives, casting the expansion as the right decision for the state, morally and monetarily.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pro-life, it\u2019s saving lives, it is creating jobs, it is saving hospitals,\u201d Ms. Brewer said in an interview from her office in the Capitol\u2019s executive tower, where she conducts what she often describes as \u201cthe people\u2019s business.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you can get any more conservative than that,\u201d she said.         \n\nA lot of conservatives disagree. Ms. Brewer\u2019s maneuvering, including a threat to veto any bill brought before her until the expansion was voted on and a last-minute call for a legislative special session to force the vote, has sparked ire among the Republican rank and file. In interviews, many of its most loyal members conceded that the party\u2019s once cohesive ideology has been tainted by the governor\u2019s stance, and they are arming themselves for payback.         \n\nName-calling, once reserved for closed-door encounters and precinct committee meetings, has seeped into the public debate, loudly. One conservative blog, Sonoran Alliance, has taken to describing the Republican legislators who voted for the expansion as \u201cBrewercrats\u201d and the expansion itself as \u201cObrewercare,\u201d a play on the Republican moniker for President Obama\u2019s health care overhaul.         \n\nA. J. LaFaro, the chairman of the  \n, compared the governor to  \n during a hearing in the State House of Representatives. In a  \n by  \n, a libertarian group, Tyler S. Boyer, a district chairman, characterized the tactics that Ms. Brewer used to push through the expansion as \u201can unfortunate display of moral ineptitude.\u201d         \n\n\u201cReagan once said Republicans shouldn\u2019t speak ill of one another,\u201d said  \n, a conservative who began exploring a run for a legislative seat after her district\u2019s Republican state representative and senator voted to expand Medicaid. \u201cI\u2019ve had a very hard time keeping my mouth shut.\u201d         \n\nVolunteers have eight more weeks to finish the job of collecting signatures to put the Medicaid expansion on the ballot, with the hope that voters will undo what Ms. Brewer fought so hard to get approved. That is happening despite the fact that voters agreed, in 1996 and in 2000, to extend Medicaid coverage to childless adults, one of the main beneficiaries of expansion.         \n\n\u201cShe abandoned the planks of the Republican Party platform to do whatever she perceived to be popular, and she grossly miscalculated the power we had to fight back,\u201d said Frank Antenori, a former Republican state senator from Tucson and one of the forces behind the initiative.         \n\nVolunteers must gather 86,400 valid signatures to put the question to voters. Mr. Antenori said they were collecting, on average, 1,300 signatures a day.         \n\nMeanwhile, inside and outside the Capitol, Ms. Brewer\u2019s team has been building its defenses. This month, it hired circulators to get people to sign a petition in support of the Medicaid expansion, an  \n that has been largely bankrolled by the same business and health care groups that financed the campaign to guarantee its passage through the Legislature. The groups have also committed to help the Republican lawmakers who stood by Ms. Brewer fend off primary challengers who plan to use Medicaid to draw disaffected voters to the polls.         \n\n\u201cThe thing to keep in mind is that the Republican primary voter is much more conservative than the Republican general-election voter,\u201d said Barrett Marson, a public relations consultant who works on Republican campaigns. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt 2014 is going to mark the end of some careers in the Legislature for the people who lent their support to Medicaid expansion.\u201d         \n\nThe governor said she would use money raised by her political action committee to aid Republican incumbents who supported her, but also to fight against those who strongly opposed her.         \n\nShe also signed a piece of legislation, pushed primarily by the Arizona Chamber of Commerce, that significantly raised the limits for contributions to political campaigns.         \n\n \n, a political consultant who managed Ms. Brewer\u2019s transition team and remains a very close ally, said the \u201cloosening of the spigot is going to do a tremendous service for that part of our party, pro-business and pro-job growth, to exercise their will in the elections.\u201d (The law is being challenged on the basis that it undermines the state\u2019s public campaign financing program, which voters enacted to limit the influence of money in politics.)
