{"headline": "Once a Vocal Champion of a Cleaner Albany, Cuomo Appears Plaintive", "body": "\nWhen Gov.  \n pushed through his ethics legislation two years ago, few clapped as loudly as the governor himself.         \n\nPassed with his administration\u2019s usual attention to public debate and due consideration (which is to say, none), the new law forces legislators and lobbyists to disclose their fees and allows for courts to seize the pensions of those politicians convicted of crimes.         \n\n\u201cThis legislation,\u201d the governor declared, \u201cwill help end an era of corruption in Albany.\u201d         \n\nThe governor\u2019s staff quickly rounded up State Senate Republicans, Assembly Democrats and government watchdog groups (who signed off on the usual scripted statements, lest any adjective go astray) to prostrate themselves and proclaim the dawn of a clean era in the capital.         \n\n \n, a former leader of the Democratic majority in the State Senate, voted for this measure. Unfortunately, he now finds himself burdened by a federal indictment, as investigators say they caught him on tape talking about buying a ballot line in the Republican mayoral primary in New York City.         \n\nThis year, a cooperating witness, heard on tape, asks Mr. Smith: Is this bribe a good investment?         \n\nMr. Smith never hesitated, replying: \u201cYeah!\u201d         \n\nIn his tale of woe is the good news for Mr. Smith, of Queens. If he ends up convicted, his pension could not be safer. The ethics law that passed in 2011 exempted every state legislator in office at the time. Only those who entered office after the law had passed faced the possibility that they could lose their pensions if convicted of taking bribes, snaring no-show jobs and contracts, and otherwise bilking taxpayers.         \n\nThe legal concept was apparently that pensions represent a contract between the state and the politician, and it cannot be torn apart even if the politician has looted and pillaged.         \n\nAs it turns out, the hastily drafted law winds up protecting those like Mr. Smith twice over. Pension revocation is a penalty in felony cases prosecuted in state courts. As luck would have it, our legion of corrupt politicians are most  \n in federal courts, where the penalty appears not to apply.         \n\nAs a fallback, let\u2019s now assume that the state\u2019s newly minted ethics panel wanted to investigate Mr. Smith, and so exact a measure of justice. That\u2019s a fine idea, but in reality, so precarious.         \n\nHere\u2019s how this panel works: A large majority can vote to investigate a politician and still fall short of the votes needed. And once it investigates, the reports can remain bottled up.         \n\nThere is no need for panel members to feel embarrassment. All votes are secret. (The long-awaited report into the sexual harassment allegations against Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez is one of several  \n.)         \n\nThere is, finally, the State Board of Elections, as toothless an old tiger as can be found in the Albany bestiary. It had one investigator. Or it did until last year, when that investigator retired.         \n\nState election laws are so elastic as to rule out their use as bungee cords. Last week, I called the board and asked about the parties that auction off their party lines to the highest bidder ( \n our plutocratic mayor, and perhaps illegally in the case of Mr. Smith).         \n\nIf I were the Bronx Republican Party boss, would it be legal to use so-called party housekeeping funds to pay for a steak dinner with buddies every week?         \n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t say,\u201d a spokesman for the board said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the time to examine every filing.\u201d         \n\nLet\u2019s assume, I said, that I wanted to be law-abiding?         \n\n\u201cYou\u2019d have to consult with your lawyer.\u201d         \n\nJerry Goldfeder, an election law expert with Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, suggests that the governor should give to the state attorney general the ability to pursue election law violations.         \n\nNot long ago, when Mr. Cuomo served as attorney general, this sounded like a grand idea to him. Now governor, he does not so much care for the current attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman. And Mr. Cuomo  \n about the idea.         \n\nIn fairness, none of this is easy for the governor. Mention ethics reform, and Dean G. Skelos, the Republican leader in the State Senate, and  \n, the Democratic Assembly leader, pace about like suspicious cats with wrinkled noses.         \n\nAnd the governor sounds a bit plaintive of late. As he complained: \u201cIf someone says, \u2018Well, we need a system where no one does anything wrong,\u2019 then they\u2019re talking about a utopia.\u201d         \n\nHere, the governor can rest easy. New York is at no imminent risk of utopia.
