{"headline": "Assad Wages War Shielded With a Smile", "body": "\nPresident Bashar al-Assad of Syria appeared to be in a jovial mood late last week, even while facing a threatened American attack, joking with a visiting Yemeni delegation about the political mess in nearby Egypt and deriding his regional rivals as \u201chalf men.\u201d         \n\nDamascus was tense \u2014 streets deadly quiet, residents stockpiling food, wives and children of the elite sent hastily abroad. But Mr. Assad kept up appearances, greeting visitors at the entrance to the boxy white presidential palace atop a hill or to his small personal office in a wooded glen nearby. \u201cHe is not hiding,\u201d a Syrian journalist noted.         \n\nThat has been his strategy, echoed in the public activities of his glamorous wife, Asma, since the March 2011 beginning of the conflict \u2014 to act as if nothing untoward is happening, as if the gory civil war that has laid waste to Syria is taking place in a different realm. Mrs. Assad, rail thin, was even photographed recently wearing a trendy fitness band on her wrist.         \n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t give the impression that he is bloodthirsty or that he\u2019s a man of war,\u201d said Talal Salman, the editor of Al-Safir newspaper in Beirut, who was once close to the Syrian leader but broke with him early over the bloody crackdown against peaceful protesters. \u201cHe does not give the sense that he\u2019s going to battle.\u201d         \n\nBut behind the veneer of normality, Mr. Assad has grown increasingly aggressive, declaring his determination to wipe out the opposition, insisting that he is standing against an imperialist enemy. Gone from at least his public statements is any talk of finding a political settlement, while he ratchets up his military drive to try to regain lost territory.         \n\nFor two and a half years, the president has never wavered from his position that the uprising is a foreign plot \u2014 and he continues to refuse to express any responsibility or remorse for the blood washing over Syria. He has steadfastly rejected calling it a civil war.         \n\nIn an interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro published on Monday, Mr. Assad said, \u201cIn the beginning, the solution should have been found through a dialogue from which political measures would have been born.\u201d         \n\nThat is no longer the case, he said, repeating his constant refrain that 90 percent of the opposition fighters are terrorists affiliated with Al Qaeda. \u201cThe only way to cope with them is to liquidate them,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly then will we be able to discuss political measures.\u201d         \n\nMr. Assad, who turns 48 next week, was never meant to rule. Bashar was the second son, summoned home from his training as an ophthalmologist in Britain in 1994 after his macho older brother, Bassel, died driving his Mercedes-Benz too fast on the Damascus airport road. But even before he inherited the presidency from his father, Hafez, in 2000, Syrians had hoped he would bring change. They even called him \u201cThe Hope.\u201d         \n\nHe championed computers at a time when the government still registered fax machines. He spoke English. He married a well-educated, beautiful woman and drove her to the opera in the family Audi. He described the oppressive Baath Party that his father had built as \u201ca corpse on his shoulders,\u201d Mr. Salman remembered.         \n\nBut Mr. Assad ultimately balked at challenging his father\u2019s legacy. Instead the president never seriously entertained the idea that reform required fundamentally altering the police state that his father had begun constructing in 1970.         \n\nTo this day he believes that system can be resurrected.         \n\n\u201cThis is his mood,\u201d said Samir al-Taqi, a heart surgeon once close to the president who fled into exile even before the uprising. \u201cHe thinks he can return and resume ruling as he did before.\u201d         \n\nAbdullah al-Maqtari, a Yemeni Parliament member from a party that supports Mr. Assad, said the president exhibited \u201chigh morale\u201d during an hourlong discussion with his delegation on Thursday.
