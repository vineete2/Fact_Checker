{"headline": "Obama Outlines Plans for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac", "body": "\nPHOENIX \u2014 President Obama hailed both this city\u2019s and the country\u2019s comeback from the housing bust on Tuesday, and said it was now time to reduce the federal role and risk in the mortgage market \u201cto make sure the kind of crisis we went through never happens again.\u201d         \n\nHe proposed to \u201cwind down\u201d Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for the first time outlining his approach to overhauling the two giant mortgage-finance companies that were taken over by the government when they failed nearly five years ago. The companies, which Mr. Obama described in an appearance here as \u201cnot really government, but not really private sector,\u201d recently began to repay taxpayers.         \n\n\u201cFor too long, these companies were allowed to make big profits buying mortgages, knowing that if their bets went bad, taxpayers would be left holding the bag,\u201d the president said. \u201cIt was \u2018heads we win, tails you lose.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nSince early 2011, the administration has voiced support for overhauling Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which long benefited from an implicit government guarantee. Years ago the companies came to symbolize a self-dealing Washington culture beneficial to both parties, and especially Democrats, but Mr. Obama\u2019s remarks on what comes next were his most specific. For several years, the administration held back from revamping the mortgage-finance system for fear of rattling a weakened market.         \n\nMr. Obama on Tuesday endorsed the thrust of bipartisan legislation from a Senate group that would \u201cend Fannie and Freddie as we know them.\u201d The so-called government-sponsored enterprises for decades bought and sold mortgages from financial institutions to provide money for the banks to keep lending to home buyers.         \n\nUnder Mr. Obama\u2019s principles, which he said were reflected in the Senate bill taking shape, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would further shrink their portfolios and lose the implicit guarantee of a federal government bailout. Instead, private investors would be most at risk, with the government a secondary guarantor.         \n\n\u201cFirst, private capital should take a bigger role in the mortgage markets. I know that sounds confusing to folks who call me a socialist,\u201d Mr. Obama said, drawing laughs and applause. \u201cI believe that our housing system should operate where there\u2019s a limited government role,\u201d he added, \u201cand private lending should be the backbone of the housing market.\u201d         \n\nThe president said that any measure he signed into law \u201cshould preserve access to safe and simple mortgage products like the 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something families should be able to rely on when they\u2019re making the most important purchase of their lives,\u201d he said.         \n\nSenator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia who is part of the bipartisan effort on the Senate banking committee, welcomed the president\u2019s endorsement. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see additional momentum,\u201d he said in a statement.         \n\nBrian Gardner, a senior vice president in Washington at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, wrote to clients that Mr. Obama\u2019s address on mortgage finance was \u201cimportant because the administration has not discussed it in some time.\u201d Despite the presidential push, he said, Congress is not likely to approve a bill before 2015.         \n\nSeparate legislation in the Republican-controlled House would remove the government from the mortgage market, including from the decision whether to keep providing the 30-year mortgage. But Mr. Gardner wrote that even \u201cmany free market proponents acknowledge that the government will play some backstop role in a future system\u201d and be compensated for it.         \n\nAfter years in which the formerly formidable Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and their Congressional allies blocked proposals requiring some kind of fees or risk premiums, Mr. Obama is calling for an assessment to be paid to the government on the value of mortgage-backed securities.         \n\nUnder his proposals, the revenue from an assessment would help finance aid for borrowers and the construction of houses and rental properties that lower-income Americans could afford.         \n\nMr. Obama\u2019s focus was homeownership. But he emphasized the need for more affordable rental housing more than he had before. Advocates have called for a \u201crebalance\u201d of government subsidies, which they say have too long been skewed toward homeownership and mostly benefit the affluent.         \n\n\u201cIn the run-up to the crisis, banks and the government too often made everyone feel like they had to own a home, even if they weren\u2019t ready and didn\u2019t have the payment,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThat\u2019s a mistake we shouldn\u2019t repeat,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, let\u2019s invest in affordable rental housing.\u201d         \n\nMr. Obama purposely spoke in Phoenix, where weeks after taking office he first announced his ideas for providing relief to homeowners and stemming foreclosures. Here, as in much of the nation, home values and sales are up, and foreclosures are down. Before arriving at a high school gym packed with an enthusiastic crowd, he visited a housing construction company that has quintupled its work force since the bust.         \n\nBut as he often does, Mr. Obama tempered his celebration of better times, and his administration\u2019s role in helping to reach them, with acknowledgment that the recovery was not complete.         \n\n\u201cThe truth is, it\u2019s been a long, slow process,\u201d he conceded. \u201cBut during that time we\u2019ve helped millions of Americans save an average of $3,000 each year by refinancing at lower rates. We\u2019ve helped millions of responsible homeowners stay in their homes, which was good for their neighbors because you don\u2019t want a bunch of foreclosure signs in your neighborhood.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/07/us/politics/obama-fannie-mae-freddie-mac.html", "date": "2013-08-06", "description": "President Obama endorsed efforts in the Senate to wind down the two mortgage finance giants and end their longtime implicit guarantee of a federal government bailout."}
