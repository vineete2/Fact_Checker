{"headline": "Casey Affleck Should Be More Famous", "body": "\nBefore Casey Affleck started filming \u201cOut of the Furnace\u201d last year, he felt, professionally speaking, as if he\u2019d lost his way. Five years earlier, in 2007, he had two breakout roles: \u201cGone Baby Gone,\u201d directed by his older brother Ben, and \u201cThe Assassination of Jesse James By the Coward Robert Ford,\u201d in which he played the coward, Robert Ford, and for which he received an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. In the years following, though, he had starred in only two live-action films (and provided a voice for the cartoon \u201cParaNorman\u201d). His most recent and notorious creative project was in 2010, when he poured his heart, brain and wallet into \u201cI\u2019m Still Here,\u201d a passion project he made with his brother-in-law and close friend, Joaquin Phoenix. The hoax-documentary purported to chronicle Phoenix\u2019s real-life personal implosion, as he supposedly made the switch from acting to a rap career. The film not only met with many terrible reviews but actually seemed to enrage the media. Dana Stevens of Slate had a not untypical critical reaction: \u201cThe worst thing about \u2018I\u2019m Still Here\u2019 is the fact that it exists.\u201d         \n\nSo when Affleck started shooting \u201cOut of the Furnace,\u201d an ambitious film about two brothers in steel-town Pennsylvania, he was looking to regain something. During a scene, sitting across from his co-star Christian Bale, he realized what that thing was. \u201cWhat I saw Christian doing was, I felt like, some of the best acting that I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Affleck says. \u201cYou know when you sort of forget what you like about movies, and then you see a movie again that reminds you of why you fell in love with them in the first place? That was the experience.\u201d After his first day of shooting, Affleck called Matt Damon, whom he has known since he was 5, and who happened also to be nearby, in Pittsburgh, making a different film, \u201cPromised Land.\u201d         \n\n\u201cHe came over for dinner, and he was bummed out,\u201d Damon told me. \u201cCasey has always been very hard on himself. But he was 35, he\u2019s not a kid anymore and he was genuinely disturbed about what had happened. He had just done a scene with Bale, and he had been so blown away by what Christian had done \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t anything remarkable; it was a difficult scene, but what Christian had to do was relatively simple, he wasn\u2019t pulling any tricks. He was genuine and honest and real.\u201d According to Damon, Casey told him that, by comparison, \u201cI was just pulling faces.\u201d         \n\n \nof the best actors of his generation,\u201d Scott Cooper, his director on \u201cOut of the Furnace,\u201d said to me. \u201cIn many cases, you hear someone say, Well, this guy\u2019s underrated. That might be true among the general populace, but with Casey, among his peers, he is certainly not underrated.\u201d Cooper, who directed Jeff Bridges\u2019s Oscar-winning performance in \u201cCrazy Heart,\u201d had thought of Affleck specifically for the role of Rodney Baze Jr. \u2014 a P.T.S.D.-addled vet who turns to drinking and bare-knuckle boxing as a way of paying off gambling debts and grappling with his inner violence.         \n\nDespite this affection within Hollywood circles, and despite the fact that his brother (Ben) and his childhood friend (Matt Damon) have become two of the most famous men in the world, Affleck finds himself perpetually poised on the verge of being discovered by a larger audience. Yet he\u2019s also shown an apparent inability to make that leap \u2014 to escape the trap of being known simply as the other Affleck. This isn\u2019t just a symptom of an easily distracted public eye. To a large extent, it\u2019s self-imposed \u2014 you might even say self-inflicted.         \n\nHe tells me he decided \u201cpretty early on\u201d that he was chronically uncomfortable with the demands of celebrity, \u201cbut it\u2019s mostly because I knew that I wasn\u2019t good at it. . . . It didn\u2019t feel good to me, and I wasn\u2019t pulling it off.\u201d Affleck\u2019s discomfort with the topic is palpable \u2014 and also notable, given that Ben and Damon have both proved to be excellent at being famous. Ben Affleck, despite some early struggles with fame, has since enjoyed a redemptive comeback that culminated in an Oscar win. Damon is rare among superstar actors: he\u2019s managed to keep his private life more or less private, his artistic choices are consistently interesting, and he still finds time to star in viral videos cursing out Jimmy Kimmel.
