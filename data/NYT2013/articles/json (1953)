{"headline": "British Tabloids on Trial, Along With Ex-Editors", "body": "\nLONDON \u2014 The ethics of the once mighty and still powerful British newspaper industry went on trial here on Monday, with two former top editors from Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire facing criminal accusations involving phone hacking and obstructing justice.         \n\nThe case features one of Mr. Murdoch\u2019s favorites, Rebekah Brooks, and another editor who became a top aide to Prime Minister David Cameron, Andy Coulson. The trial is expected to be aggressive and detailed, with the potential for yet more revelations about the inner workings of the competitive world of British tabloid journalism and its tangled relationships with the political elite and law-enforcement officials.         \n\nThe two main defendants, both 45, arrived early at London\u2019s Central Criminal Court, known as the Old Bailey, in a storm of photographers\u2019 flashes. Monday\u2019s opening of the trial, which is expected to last at least four months, was devoted to impaneling a jury. There are six other defendants in the case.         \n\nThe trial, in which all the defendants deny guilt, may also add momentum to efforts to regulate Britain\u2019s obstreperous press. That effort hit a stalemate after a lengthy revelatory inquiry, led by Lord Justice Sir Brian Leveson, ended last year after exposing a toxic web of criminal practices by the news media, including computer hacking and bribery of police officials.         \n\n\u201cThe ethics of the whole of the British press are again in the spotlight\u201d with this trial, said Brian Cathcart, a former newspaper deputy editor and director of Hacked Off, an organization campaigning for media reform and tighter regulation. Britain has had years of media \u201cintrusion into peoples\u2019 lives without a public interest \u2014 of distortion, of bullying, even blackmailing,\u201d he said, as well as other illegal activities, like obtaining personal data under false pretenses, known here as \u201cblagging.\u201d         \n\nJudge Leveson proposed regulations underwritten by law, a plan that was soon watered down. But the question of regulation quickly brings concern that Britain\u2019s press freedoms, a tradition of three centuries, could be at risk. So far, politicians have been arguing with newspaper groups in a fiery debate with no clear resolution.         \n\nTim Luckhurst, a former newspaper editor and professor of journalism at the University of Kent, said, \u201cWhat the trial will do is to refocus public attention on the fact that the new system of regulation has been recommended and we don\u2019t have it.\u201d         \n\nBoth Ms. Brooks and Mr. Coulson were powerful journalists whose influence extended deep into the political world. After editing The News of the World tabloid \u2014 which Mr. Murdoch eventually closed in an effort to stem the scandal over accessing cellphone messages of reporting targets \u2014 Mr. Coulson became Mr. Cameron\u2019s communications director. Ms. Brooks, a former editor and top Murdoch executive, was on friendly terms with Mr. Cameron \u2014 a school chum of her husband, Charlie Brooks, from his Eton days \u2014 lending him horses to ride in the country, seeing him socially and sometimes exchanging text messages.         \n\nOther executives and reporters from Mr. Murdoch\u2019s group are prominent among the 62 journalists who have been arrested in multiple police investigations, including some from other news groups.         \n\nThis is hardly the first scandal surrounding the British news media and its methods. As long ago as 1989, David Mellor, a Conservative cabinet minister, warned that the press \u201cis drinking in the Last Chance Saloon.\u201d Mr. Mellor suffered the consequences, quitting in 1992 after falling victim to newspaper expos\u00e9s of his personal life.         \n\nMore than 20 years later, many of the same arguments are being rehearsed about the relationships between politicians and journalists, and about privacy and intrusion \u2014 now aided by technology that helps investigators who once earned cash by examining the garbage of celebrities.         \n\nThe Leveson inquiry exposed some incestuously close ties between politicians and senior newspaper figures. \u201cAppearances do count and politicians should not be seen to be friendly with newspaper proprietors,\u201d Mr. Cathcart said. \u201cThe history of British politicians and the press is not one of interference \u2014 it is one of subservience,\u201d he said. Politicians \u201chave been too indulgent to the press because of the pressure they can bring to bear at election time, when they can shaft you or promote you.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/28/world/europe/british-tabloids-on-trial-along-with-ex-editors.html", "date": "2013-10-27", "description": "The trial of former editors in Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire is expected to be aggressive and detailed, with the potential for more revelations about the inner workings of British tabloid journalism."}
