{"headline": "N.S.A. Spied on Allies, Aid Groups and Businesses", "body": "\nSecret documents reveal more than 1,000 targets of American and British surveillance in recent years, including the office of an Israeli prime minister, heads of international aid organizations, foreign energy companies and a European Union official involved in antitrust battles with American technology businesses.         \n\nWhile the names of some political and diplomatic leaders have previously emerged as targets, the newly disclosed intelligence documents provide a much fuller portrait of the spies\u2019 sweeping interests in more than 60 countries.         \n\nBritain\u2019s Government Communications Headquarters, working closely with the National Security Agency, monitored the communications of senior European Union officials, foreign leaders including African heads of state and sometimes their family members, directors of United Nations and other relief programs, and officials overseeing oil and finance ministries, according to the documents. In addition to Israel, some targets involved close allies like France and Germany, where  \n over recent revelations about spying by the N.S.A.         \n\nDetails of the surveillance are described in documents from the N.S.A. and Britain\u2019s eavesdropping agency, known as GCHQ, dating from 2008 to 2011. The target lists appear in a set of GCHQ reports that sometimes identify which agency requested the surveillance, but more often do not. The documents were leaked by the former N.S.A. contractor Edward J. Snowden and shared by The New York Times,  \n and  \n.         \n\nThe reports are spare, technical bulletins produced as the spies, typically working out of British intelligence sites, systematically tapped one international communications link after another, focusing especially on satellite transmissions. The value of each link is gauged, in part, by the number of surveillance targets found to be using it for emails, text messages or phone calls. More than 1,000 targets, which also include people suspected of being terrorists or militants, are in the reports.         \n\nIt is unclear what the eavesdroppers gleaned. The documents include a few fragmentary transcripts of conversations and messages, but otherwise contain only hints that further information was available elsewhere, possibly in a larger database.         \n\nSome condemned the surveillance on Friday as unjustified and improper. \u201cThis is not the type of behavior that we expect from strategic partners,\u201d Pia Ahrenkilde Hansen, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, said on the latest revelations of American and British spying in Europe.         \n\nSome of the surveillance relates to issues that are being scrutinized by President Obama and a panel he appointed in Washington that on Wednesday  \n on the N.S.A., particularly on spying of foreign leaders, especially allies.         \n\nThe reports show that spies monitored the email traffic of several Israeli officials, including one target identified as \u201cIsraeli prime minister,\u201d followed by an email address. The prime minister at the time, in January 2009, was Ehud Olmert. The next month, spies intercepted the email traffic of the Israeli defense minister, Ehud Barak, according to another report. Two Israeli embassies also appear on the target lists.         \n\nMr. Olmert said in a telephone interview on Friday that the email address was used for correspondence with his office, which he said staff members often handled. He added that it was unlikely that any secrets could have been compromised.         \n\n\u201cThis was an unimpressive target,\u201d Mr. Olmert said. He noted, for example, that his most sensitive discussions with President George W. Bush took place in person. \u201cI would be surprised if there was any attempt by American intelligence in Israel to listen to the prime minister\u2019s lines,\u201d he said.         \n\nMr. Barak, who declined to comment, has said publicly that he used to take it for granted that he was under surveillance.         \n\nDespite the close ties between the United States and Israel, the record of mutual spying is long: Israeli spies, including Jonathan Jay Pollard, who was sentenced in 1987 to life in prison for passing intelligence information to Israel, have often operated in the United States, and the United States has often turned the abilities of the N.S.A. against Israel.         \n\nMr. Olmert\u2019s office email was intercepted while he was dealing with fallout from  \n to rocket attacks from Gaza, but also at a particularly tense time in relations with the United States. The two countries were simultaneously at odds on Israeli preparations to attack Iran\u2019s nuclear program and cooperating on a  \n on Iran\u2019s major nuclear enrichment facility.         \n\nA year before the interception of Mr. Olmert\u2019s office email, the documents listed another target, the Institute of Physics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, an internationally recognized center for research in atomic and nuclear physics.         \n\nAlso appearing on the surveillance lists is Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, vice president of the European Commission, which, among other powers, has oversight of antitrust issues in Europe. The commission has broad authority over local and foreign companies, and it has punished a number of American companies, including Microsoft and Intel, with heavy fines for hampering fair competition. The reports say that spies intercepted Mr. Almunia\u2019s communications in 2008 and 2009.
