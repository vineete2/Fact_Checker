{"headline": "Memory of a Mass Killing Becomes Another Casualty of Egyptian Protests", "body": "\nCAIRO \u2014 The police arrested the girls, interrogated them for hours, and then strip-searched and detained them for 10 days. They were charged with serious crimes, including endangering national security, for what the authorities regarded as an act of subversion: passing out yellow balloons.         \n\nThe yellow was intended to symbolize Rabaa al-Adawiya, a square in Cairo that became the scene of a mass killing after security forces fired on protesters in August while trying to break up an Islamist sit-in. The girls, among them one whose brother died in the square, were distributing the balloons in the city of Ismailia last month in a show of solidarity with the victims.         \n\n\u201cThey are afraid of anything that reminds them of Rabaa,\u201d one of the girls, Roqaya Saeed, 17, said of the Egyptian authorities. \u201cA black spot they can\u2019t erase.\u201d         \n\nMemory has become a frequent casualty of Egypt\u2019s politics since the uprising against former President Hosni Mubarak in 2011. Leaders have tried to wipe away histories of atrocities by foot-dragging on investigations until new bloodshed dulls memories of the old. But nothing so far has matched the effort by the military-backed government and its supporters to extinguish the memory of  \n, the site of the worst mass killing in Egypt\u2019s modern history, and a dangerous reminder of absent justice and Egypt\u2019s festering political feuds.         \n\nThe traumas multiply, clouding Egypt\u2019s path forward. Other countries with similar legacies of authoritarianism or widespread police abuses \u201chad transitional justice before they were able to turn the page,\u201d said Ahmed Ezzat, a human rights activist, who said that such a process would involve trials for perpetrators, truth commissions, reparations for victims and the reform of corrupt institutions.         \n\nBut none of Egypt\u2019s leaders possessed \u201cthe political will\u201d to confront the abuses, he said.         \n\nInstead, reminders of the past have become a threat. Athletes have drawn outrage and censure for displaying the four-finger Rabaa symbol \u2014 Rabaa means \u201cfourth\u201d in Arabic \u2014 at competitions. For its part, the military quickly transformed the square where as many as 900 people were killed, leaving no hint of the violence except the bullet holes in lampposts and homes.         \n\nThe bloodied roads have been covered with fresh asphalt, and the charred Rabaa al-Adawiya mosque that gives the square its name has been repainted in eggshell white. Paving stones that were hurled in protest have been replaced. Young shrubs brighten the place.         \n\nIn a statement about its extensive work in restoring the square, the military said it had constructed a fountain and memorial in a place that it acknowledged had \u201cwitnessed the most difficult periods in Egypt\u2019s history.\u201d But the memorial \u2014 a minimalist sculpture depicting two hands, representing the army and the police, cradling an orb that is supposed to represent the people \u2014 seemed to revise history rather than confront it.         \n\n\u201cThey did it so quickly,\u201d said Rabaa Abo Salma, 27, who lives near the square. \u201cTo make it look like nothing happened.\u201d         \n\nThere has been talk about, but no movement on, a government investigation into the violence, which occurred at a sit-in by supporters of former President Mohamed Morsi, who was ousted by the military in July. The work has been left to the semiofficial  \n, which has no power to compel officials to testify.         \n\nRagia Omran, a council member, said they had started to interview witnesses and review videos of the violence. She said she had faith there would be justice, eventually. \u201cIt will happen later on,\u201d she said.         \n\nIn the meantime, the country has not even been able to agree on the final death toll, and the authorities have released conflicting figures. They have said that between 683 and 1,000 people, including 43 police officers, were killed across the country on Aug. 14, the day the authorities stormed Rabaa al-Adawiya, as well as another sit-in by Morsi supporters at Nahda Square. Mr. Morsi\u2019s Islamist movement, the Muslim Brotherhood, has released figures widely seen as inflated, claiming that thousands died. Other reports have put the number at between 800 and 900 people.         \n\nThere is little clamor for any inquiry among the public, which harbors deep antipathy toward the Brotherhood and seems desperate to move on from the era of protest. Despite a crackdown on the movement, Mr. Morsi\u2019s supporters have continued to march. They have adopted the name of the square as their slogan, and the four-finger symbol that has become its own provocation.         \n\nIn recent weeks, two Egyptian athletes have ignited controversy after flashing the symbol at sporting events, a gesture, they said, to the people who died. One of them, Mohamed Youssef, who wore a Rabaa T-shirt as he was receiving a gold medal at a kung fu competition in Russia, received a yearlong suspension from competition by Egypt\u2019s Kung Fu Association,  \n.
