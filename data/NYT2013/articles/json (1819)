{"headline": "Making a Stand-Up Meal of the Sit-Down Taco", "body": "\nTalking about the best taco you\u2019ve ever had in a restaurant is like talking about the best kiss you\u2019ve ever had in a hospital. No matter how good it was, it would have been better somewhere else.         \n\nUntil recently, New Yorkers didn\u2019t need to give much thought to this subject. Now we are in a state of intense taco consciousness. This is a result, on one hand, of the great boom in traditional tacos made by New Yorkers who have recently arrived from several taco-rich regions of Mexico and, on the other hand, of the new fascination for Mexican cuisine shown by cooks born somewhere else.         \n\nWe eat traditional tacos and new-wave tacos; barbacoa goat tacos and Moroccan lamb tacos; San Diego-style fried-fish tacos and Japanese spicy tuna tacos; cecina tacos and bulgogi tacos; tongue tacos and hamburger tacos; Tex-Mex chorizo-and-egg tacos and Tex-Tex smoked brisket tacos; tacos filled with lobster and tacos filled with Wagyu; tacos on folded waffles served only at brunch and tofu-broccoli tacos culled from the vegan diaspora.         \n\nChefs preparing Mexican food want to make sure we don\u2019t slip back into our primitive state of taco innocence. Last week, a two-story leviathan called  \n lumbered into the meatpacking district with 250 seats and a taco-heavy menu from the chef Akhtar Nawab. Slightly smaller but still crushingly popular, April Bloomfield\u2019s  \n in Midtown has been griddling about 1,000 corn tortillas a day since opening last December. The chef Alex Stupak, who has always served tacos at  \n, recently put them on the menu at  \n, which he had once defined as the restaurant where he would not serve them.         \n\nBut the allure has spread far beyond Mexican kitchens. Jean-Georges Vongerichten and Dan Kluger at  \n, Floyd Cardoz at North End Grill, Bobby Flay at  \n, Andrew Carmellini at  \n,  \n at Porsena Extra Bar and Marcus Samuelsson at  \n have gotten into the taco business. Of these, only ABC Cocina attempts a Latin American theme.         \n\nThis ought to be a glorious moment, in other words, for sit-down tacos. But it\u2019s not. All the worst tacos I\u2019ve eaten, and only a handful of the best, have come from New York restaurant kitchens.         \n\nThis is not because I romanticize the hot, dribbly taco eaten with a tilted head and cupped hand at a stall in Mexico City or a parking lot in Chinatown in Los Angeles or a sidewalk in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. No, it\u2019s because, objectively speaking, those tacos have a better shot at greatness than one that rides on a plate from a kitchen to a table.         \n\nI am not talking about the tacos you make yourself by wrapping a few forkfuls of your mole or adobo into a warm and willing tortilla pulled moments before from the basket next to your margarita. Those are almost always fantastic, and if you like tacos I strongly urge you to eat them that way as often as possible.         \n\nThe problem tacos, the underachieving tacos, are the ones assembled on a plate by an overworked line cook and then picked up by an overworked server and ferried across the dining room to your table, where they sit and wait until you and all the people you\u2019re out with stop talking and drinking and begin to eat. All this time, the tortilla has been curling and going brittle like an autumn leaf and the filling has been nosing up toward room temperature.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s dying! It\u2019s dying!\u201d Peter Cho, the chef of Salvation Taco, said. Mr. Cho was given the job three months ago, not long after I wrote a review detailing a series of cold, forlorn tacos, and he began changing kitchen procedures. Tacos now come three to a plate instead of one so that \u201cthey all cuddle and keep each other warm.\u201d         \n\nTo speed assembly, he slashed the number of garnishes and told the cooks to focus on no more than two plates at a time. Most of all, he has tried to impress on them that the life span of a hot corn tortilla is measured in seconds. \u201cI tell the guys that as soon as it comes out of the steamer, the clock is ticking,\u201d he said.         \n\nAt his two places, Mr. Stupak uses flour tortillas, which are more forgiving. Still, he feels as if his ambitions are sometimes at odds with the layout of his spaces.         \n\n\u201cIf I were to do another taco-driven thing in New York City, I wouldn\u2019t build it the same way,\u201d he said. \u201cI love hole-in-the-wall taquerias and I love street stand taquerias for a host of reasons. I like the physical nature. I like that there is no restaurant between you and the taco.\u201d Having the person who made your taco immediately place it in your hand, he said, \u201cis better for the product.\u201d         \n\nAnother advantage of working in a hole in the wall is that there isn\u2019t enough space to do anything but make tacos. As Zen monks know, repetition leads to enlightenment. Making tacos over and over results in more perfectly sized and shaped tacos. Some of the least perfect tacos I\u2019ve seen came from a restaurant kitchen where the person making them was probably responsible for 6 or 12 other items, most of which are meant to be eaten with a fork.
