{"headline": "Anti-Doping Agency Exposed Armstrong, but What About Others?", "body": "\nSome were cyclists who injected themselves with banned endurance boosters and popped testosterone pills. Some lay side by side with teammates while blood dripped from chilled IV bags and into their swelling veins. Others were doctors who helped cyclists dope or middlemen who ferried drugs for  \n\u2019s United States Postal Service team.         \n\nThose people \u2014 more than three dozen of them \u2014 were mentioned in the United States Anti-Doping Agency report that exposed Armstrong\u2019s long-lived lies and duplicity. But a year after the report was released, we still do not know the identities of most of them. Their names were blacked out from the pages of evidence, replaced by labels like Rider-15 or Other-4.         \n\nTravis Tygart, the chief executive of the antidoping agency, said the names were not revealed because Usada was investigating those people for possible doping offenses. Common sense says their names were also not included in the report because they would not be good witnesses or because Usada already had the goods on Armstrong, its marked man.         \n\nBut now, 12 months later, none of those doping investigations have turned into official cases that punished people for breaking the rules. Tygart said that some were still in the works \u2014 he would not give details about open cases \u2014 but that others would not go anywhere because the evidence was so flimsy that it \u201cwon\u2019t stand up in court.\u201d         \n\nSo, where does that leave cycling, and us? Many of the people identified as taking part in doping are still working in the sport, profiting from the doping and cheating that got them to the top.         \n\nUsada says it is not worried. It says it is looking at the big picture. Tygart said he had taken the initial steps to reaching his goal of \u201cdismantling the doping that has corrupted a sport for decades.\u201d         \n\nHe spent a good part of the last year trying to help oust the International Cycling Union president Pat McQuaid, a member of the International Olympic Committee who tried to hinder Usada\u2019s investigation into Armstrong at almost every turn. Tygart spoke to the French Senate, the German Parliament and a gathering of European Union sports officials, criticizing the cycling union for failing to do more to clean up its sport \u2014 a big hint to sports officials that McQuaid had to go.         \n\nLast month, McQuaid finally went \u2014 beaten in his bid for another term as the cycling union president. In came Britain\u2019s Brian Cookson, who has already made significant changes to the sport\u2019s governing body, including re-establishing working relationships with Usada and the World Anti-Doping Agency in what seems to be a sincere effort to rid cycling of doping. Under McQuaid, those relationships were miserably tense at best.         \n\nBut leaders in antidoping efforts and the sport still have much work to do to change the culture of doping in cycling\u2019s bloodstream. It is a culture that began more than 100 years ago, with  \n riders numbing their pain with substances like alcohol and the rat poison strychnine. That mentality remains, with some tired riders chugging so-called finishing bottles, liquids laced with crushed caffeine pills, nonbanned painkillers and who knows what else.         \n\nIt is a culture in which Armstrong\u2019s brand of bullying, intimidation and peer pressure might not rule the sport anymore, but is likely to exist.         \n\nAt the 2004 Tour, Armstrong chased down the Italian rider Filippo Simeoni and kept him from winning the 18th stage. He did it to punish Simeoni for testifying against the Italian doctor Michele Ferrari, who had been under investigation for doping his riders. Ferrari was Armstrong\u2019s doctor.         \n\nArmstrong told off Simeoni and made an ominous \u201czip the lips\u201d gesture to television cameras, later saying he stopped Simeoni\u2019s bid to win because it was \u201cin the interest of the peloton.\u201d         \n\n\u201cAll he wants to do is destroy cycling and destroy the sport that pays him, and that\u2019s wrong,\u201d Armstrong said of the omert\u00e0 that protected his secrets for more than 15 years.         \n\nWhile riders like George Hincapie, Tyler Hamilton and Floyd Landis defied the code of silence with their confessions of drug use (and stories of Armstrong\u2019s drug use), that unwritten rule might still be alive. A bizarre moment in the 2012 Tour de France suggested it.         \n\nThe plan among the teams in that Tour\u2019s peloton was to let Hincapie lead all riders onto the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in the waning miles of the race. As the cyclists zipped down the grand boulevard in Paris, Hincapie would momentarily have center stage as he \u2014 the respected veteran who had started the race a record 17 times \u2014 pedaled the last miles of his final Tour.
