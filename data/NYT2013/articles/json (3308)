{"headline": "African Circle Mystery Solved? Maybe It\u2019s Chewing", "body": "\nHave you heard the one about the little termite that could, and did, take on a desert and turn it green? At least a little greener, except for those spots.         \n\nThe reddish barren spots, thousands of them, are called fairy circles, the name itself an invitation to try to solve the mystery of their origins. They dot a narrow belt of desert stretching from Angola through Namibia into northern South Africa. For no obvious reason, the round patches of sandy soil interrupt the arid grassland, like a spreading blight on the land.         \n\nTo the Himba people who live in the region, however, there is nothing to explain. That\u2019s just how it is, they tell anthropologists; the circles were made by their \u201coriginal ancestor, Mukuru,\u201d or more poetically, they are \u201cfootprints of the gods.\u201d A just-so story blames a mythical dragon that lives in a crack deep under the earth. The dragon\u2019s poisonous breath kills vegetation to create the circles. Trouble is, some scientists point out, the bad-breath hypothesis apparently originated with fanciful tour guides.         \n\nNew research may now have yielded a more credible explanation for the fairy circles as examples of natural ecosystem engineering by a particular species of sand termites, Psammotermes allocerus. A German scientist reported on Thursday that most likely these industrious termites were the agents for making much of their desert home an oasis of permanent grassland.         \n\n \n, Norbert Juergens, a professor of ecology at the University of Hamburg, said these termites \u201cmatch the beaver with regard to intensity of environmental change, but surpass it with regard to the spatial dimension of their impact.\u201d         \n\nOver the 1,200-mile length of the Namib Desert, especially in parts of Namibia, Dr. Juergens wrote, \u201cP. allocerus turns wide desert regions of predominately ephemeral life into landscapes dominated by species-rich perennial grassland supporting uninterrupted perennial life even during dry seasons and drought years.\u201d         \n\nLast year, Walter R. Tschinkel, a biologist at Florida State University, published  \n of aerial and satellite photography and other research to describe the number, size and dynamics of these formations. Some are as small as six feet in diameter and never grow much bigger. The largest ones can be at least 40 feet across. It was estimated that the smaller circles have average life spans of 24 years, the larger ones as much as 75 years.         \n\nBut Dr. Tschinkel had first assumed that termites were implicated and went looking for nests of a different species, harvester termites, without success. He finally concluded that no other termites had been associated with the circles, and seemed resigned to a mystery unsolved.         \n\nIn a critique, Dr. Tschinkel said he was unconvinced that the termites are the cause of the circles. He said the paper by Dr. Juergens \u201chas made the common scientific error of confusing correlation (even very strong correlation) with causation.\u201d         \n\nScientists at the University of Pretoria in South Africa have also tested hypotheses of escaping natural gases like methane or other toxins rising to the surface and wiping out vegetation at these spots. But the results have been inconclusive.         \n\nDr. Juergens said in a telephone interview that Dr. Tschinkel was \u201clooking for the wrong termites and you could easily overlook the ones that were actually living\u201d deep beneath the surface of the red sandy spots, feasting on grass roots to keep the patches of land free of vegetation. In this way, the soil is better able to absorb rainfall quickly, with little water loss due to evaporation. The absence of vegetation at the site also means that rainwater is not lost through transpiration, the evaporation of water from plants.         \n\nThe absorbed water, the scientists explained, spreads evenly in the sandy soil all around, which explains the circular patterns. This nourishes the surrounding grassland. And the termites keep chomping the roots of new shoots from beneath the inner circle, preventing new vegetation from disrupting their engineered ecosystem.
