They\u2019ll Drink to That", "body": "\nTO: HELENE         \n\nFROM: JENNIFER \u00a0         \n\nMy dearest Helene,         \n\nOver the decade that we have been work colleagues, our greatest collaborations have not, admittedly, been journalistic. Sure, we\u2019ve always had some fiscal-crisis story to attend to \u2014 me reporting from Capitol Hill, and you ensconced over at the White House. But let\u2019s face it, our interests are often more Drambuie than debt ceiling.         \n\nSo as the holidays are upon us again, I feel the need to reach out. I can\u2019t quite decide what I dread more: the canned holiday music at the grocery store, the abundance of red or all those cloying glasses of eggnog handed to us at office parties.         \n\nOne of the most puzzling things about our drinking culture is that while we have restored, revived and invented wonderful cocktails over the last decade, our holiday drinks often remain woefully antiquated and disappointing. I don\u2019t want eggnog unless it is exceptional. Phooey on the sauvignon blanc, which we all should have retired at the beach last August, and peace out, please, to the sherbet punch.         \n\nI don\u2019t think it has to be this way. We can do better as a people for our holiday parties by embracing classic ingredients, seasonal citrus fruits and holiday colors \u2014 but ditching the clich\u00e9s. We may be amateurs, but it doesn\u2019t take much to throw together some great cocktails, and even a great cocktail party.         \n\nDiscuss.         \n\nTO: JENNIFER         \n\nFROM: HELENE         \n\nHi, Steinhauer,         \n\nYes, for the holidays, you really have to crank up the cocktails a notch. Nobody looks good in red, but how about a red frozen vodka slushy? Red Roosters have become one of my specialty holiday drinks, and people love them. First, no one expects that you\u2019re going to give them a frozen drink at  \n; it\u2019s usually all mulled wine and hot spiked cider. But the Red Rooster is so deliciously icy that it perks you right out of any holiday blues.         \n\nAnd you can make them days ahead. You mix vodka, orange juice concentrate and cranberry-tangerine juice cocktail in a pitcher and freeze overnight (or whenever \u2014 I have left this stuff in my freezer for weeks; I usually freeze them in those tall water carafes you can buy at Target). When it\u2019s time to serve, just take the pitcher out and have a spoon ready to scrape the Red Roosters into martini glasses; they will never freeze solid, thanks to the vodka.         \n\n(I\u2019ve also made them with white cranberry juice, during a blizzard, when everyone on my snowed-in street was climbing the walls and in dire need of cocktails. While it didn\u2019t look like snow in a glass, it looked a bit like freezing rain.)         \n\nTO: HELENE         \n\nFROM: JENNIFER         \n\nEasy prep: a good point. Holiday cocktails should be special, but not too complicated. A bartender gets sad and cranky with too many ingredients to work with, and no one wants to wait in line for complex fare.         \n\nOne of my best memories of an office party is of you, standing in as the makeshift bartender, whipping up Campari-and-orange-juice cocktails, which slowly but surely had the collective effect of making all of us like our colleagues quite a bit more than we actually do. How did you come up with that drink? And how easy is it to replicate on the fly?         \n\nWhen it comes to cocktails and work, I generally invent them in response to a bad day. My personal favorite involves clementine oranges, one of the most delightful contributions of the winter trees, and gin, snazzed up with some soda water. And when things get dark and cold, I sometimes repair to the Tabard Inn here in Washington for its decent selections of Italian reds, but I can be lured by its signature cocktail, a blend of tequila, sherry and Drambuie, infused with the December aromas of thyme and citrus.         \n\nTO: JENNIFER         \n\nFROM: HELENE         \n\nYou asked about the Campari orange cocktails that I served a couple of years ago, right at deadline, as I recall. Campari is so deeply underrated: I discovered it more than a decade ago. The woman sitting next to me on a plane ordered \u201cCampari on ice,\u201d so, trying to seem sophisticated, I did, too. It was so bitter; I hated it. But a few months later, I was in Florence with some friends in the Piazza della Signoria, and they ordered \u201cCampari orange.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/11/dining/diy-cocktail-party-theyll-drink-to-that.html", "date": "2013-12-10", "description": "Cranking up holiday cocktails for the home or office party, but nothing too complex, please."}
