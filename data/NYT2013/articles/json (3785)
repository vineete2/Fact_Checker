{"headline": "City\u2019s Charter Schools Fear Having de Blasio for a Landlord", "body": "\n \n in New York City have flourished over the past decade, attracting donations from Wall Street, praise from leaders in business and government, and free real estate from the city.         \n\nBut with a changing of the guard imminent in City Hall, many charter school leaders are concerned that the support they have enjoyed during the three terms of  \n may be in peril.         \n\nThe leading candidate to succeed Mr. Bloomberg,  \n, a Democrat, is a no-bones-about-it critic of charter schools who rose to prominence in part by berating the mayor\u2019s educational agenda. By contrast, the Republican candidate, Joseph J. Lhota, is a fierce defender of charter schools.         \n\nIn one of his sharpest repudiations of Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s tenure, Mr. de Blasio has said he would stop offering many of the city\u2019s 183 charter schools free rent, a policy that has helped turn New York into one of the most vibrant hubs for charter schools in the country.         \n\nCharter schools, often managed by nonprofit groups, receive public funding but operate independently of the school system and have more freedom in deciding scheduling, staffing and curriculum.         \n\nThe Bloomberg administration is concerned enough about their future in the city that it is racing in its final months to place two dozen more of them into public school buildings. The board that approves school space plans will meet twice this month, an unusual step.         \n\nMr. de Blasio contends that Mr. Bloomberg has focused on charter schools to the detriment of traditional public schools, pitting parents against one another and sapping resources that could be used for after-school programs and classes like art and physical education.         \n\n\u201cI won\u2019t favor charters,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said on Tuesday after a conference in Lower Manhattan. \u201cOur central focus is traditional public schools.\u201d         \n\nAt an education forum this summer, he said of charter schools, \u201cIt is insult to injury to give them free rent.\u201d         \n\nHis aides said he was not looking to overturn all of Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s educational policies. In recent weeks, he has arranged meetings with charter school advocates; in past conversations, he has sought to persuade them that he is not a zealot who will seek to drive their schools from the city.         \n\nStill, many charter school leaders remain uneasy about Mr. de Blasio\u2019s plans. Some have started preparing for a City Hall that is resistant to their efforts. They are seeking donations in case they are forced to pay rent, freezing hiring plans and prodding teachers and students to speak out.         \n\nOn Tuesday, thousands of charter school parents, students and educators marched across the Brooklyn Bridge to voice opposition to Mr. de Blasio\u2019s rent plan and to demand more money for their schools, which serve about 70,000 children, or about 6 percent of the student population citywide.         \n\n\u201cDe Blasio is just wrong,\u201d said one marcher, Ieshia Sargent, a cosmetologist who sends her 13-year-old daughter to Girls Prep, a Lower East Side charter school. \u201cEvery other public school has free space. Why shouldn\u2019t charters have free space, too?\u201d         \n\nJames Merriman, chief executive of the New York City Charter School Center, said plans to charge rent were \u201cschemes to destroy the charter sector\u201d by opponents.         \n\n\u201cThey consider charters to be, simply in their own words, parasites,\u201d Mr. Merriman said. \u201cThose kinds of proposals would be simply disastrous.\u201d         \n\n \n has accused Mr. de Blasio of seeking to \u201cannihilate\u201d New York City\u2019s charter schools. Mr. Lhota, who has said he would maintain the free-rent policy, has pledged to double the number of charter schools in the city, which would require state approval.         \n\n\u201cIf you oppose charter schools and other choice for minorities, inner-city kids and children of immigrants, you cannot call yourself progressive,\u201d Mr. Lhota said in a speech before business leaders in Manhattan on Tuesday.         \n\nThe details of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s approach to charter schools remain murky, so it is difficult to estimate how damaging it would be to start charging them rent. Mr. de Blasio has not said how much he would charge, only that schools with the fewest resources would pay the least. At many charter schools, wealthy benefactors supplement the money the state provides for each student.
