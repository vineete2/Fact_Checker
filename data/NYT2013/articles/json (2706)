{"headline": "Setting Out the Bagels and Lox", "body": "\nThere are some who think a platter of bagels, cream cheese and lox is an ideal self-contained meal. Add some whitefish salad, sliced onion, tomatoes and maybe a small bowl of capers and you\u2019re done, without even turning on the stove.         \n\nThis said, there are times when I have family and friends coming over that I like to do it up. By filling out the offerings and keeping them fresh and inventive, I can serve what is my absolute favorite meal over and over again, for breakfast, lunch or dinner, without anyone getting tired of it.         \n\nWhen I\u2019m servings bagels and lox for dinner, in particular, I always include plenty of vegetables and salads to lighten things up. Perhaps a  \n in the summer,  \n,  \n in the winter,  \n in the spring. Something about smoked salmon makes me want cucumbers, so I always have a plate of those, too, either plain or  \n. And if I want to really fill things out, I\u2019ll add a hearty soup \u2014  \n,  \n or, in the deepest winter,  \n.         \n\nIf I\u2019m ordering my smoked fish from  \n, I\u2019ll get some seven-layer halva and cube it for dessert. Plain and simple  \n are nice alongside.         \n\nAnd by the way, when New Yorkers say bagels and lox, we don\u2019t always strictly mean the salty pickled belly meat of the salmon, which is what traditional Jewish lox is. The word lox also colloquially means any kind of cold smoked salmon that you\u2019d eat on a bagel (hot smoked salmon is a whole other thing). In general, true lox is saltier than most kinds of smoked salmon.         \n\nI always order at least two varieties of smoked salmon and let my guests compare and contrast. At my family\u2019s Yom Kippur break fast this year, smokier, leaner wild western nova from the Pacific was beat out by the mild and richer Gaspe nova from the Atlantic, which disappeared almost as soon as I set the platter down. And this was fine by me. I savored the western nova leftovers for days.         \n\nAnd that\u2019s another great thing about serving bagels and lox for a crowd \u2014 the leftovers might be even better enjoyed all by yourself.
