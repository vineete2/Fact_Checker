{"headline": "Bronx Offers Case Study Over Future of Voting Act", "body": "\nEmerging from the bloody protests in Selma, Ala., the  \n was initially heralded as a declaration that the federal government would no longer tolerate the open racism of the segregated South. But this narrow mandate to monitor elections in six Southern states grew quietly over the years, extending to unexpected corners of the country, including the Bronx.         \n\nThe borough landed on the list of places to be monitored more than four decades ago, along with Brooklyn and Manhattan, when the statewide English-language literacy test required of voters suppressed participation in Hispanic and black neighborhoods around the city to rates low enough to prompt federal intervention.         \n\nThat test, then used by the local political machine to hold on to power as the minority population swelled, is long gone, but the federal oversight has remained. As the  \n reviews a section of this landmark measure that requires federal approval of changes to voting procedures, with members of the court\u2019s conservative majority suggesting last week that it could be time to end it, the Bronx offers a case study into arguments for and against continuing the half-century effort to monitor elections through a racial prism.         \n\nCritics have pointed to the Bronx, where most of the top elected officials are Latino or black, as evidence that these federal efforts address a problem that no longer exists. But supporters say the Bronx and other boroughs, where charges of gerrymandering districts remain common, serve as a reminder that the problems that prompted the law often manifest themselves in places and in ways where racism is difficult to recognize.         \n\nEven some of those who support the Voting Rights Act suggested that it was no longer needed in New York City. Michael Benjamin, a former state assemblyman in the Bronx, said that the law had helped scores of minorities get elected to office in the borough, and that it should now fall to those local officials, not the federal government, to enforce voting rights.         \n\n\u201cWhen you break your leg, they put it in a cast, and when your leg heals, they take it off,\u201d Mr. Benjamin said. \u201cI\u2019m saying it\u2019s worked, take the cast off.\u201d         \n\nBut Norman Siegel, a prominent civil-rights lawyer, echoed other city leaders who suggested that barriers to voting could be hard to recognize and might be unintended, like budget-related reductions in polling sites or staff that result in long lines.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like the poll tax or the literacy test, but it\u2019s still preventing people from voting,\u201d Mr. Siegel said. \u201cNo one thinks of blatant racism in New York, but there are subtle forms of disenfranchisement that still exist.\u201d         \n\nElsewhere in the country, dozens of counties and towns have been removed from the federal monitoring list through a process known as a bailout, in which a jurisdiction is required to show that the federal government has not intervened in its elections in the past decade, among other things. But New York City officials have not applied for a bailout, since federal observers were sent as recently as last year to monitor polling activities in the Bronx, Manhattan and Queens.         \n\nInstead leaders, including Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and State Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman, have called on the Supreme Court to uphold the voting rights law. In a brief in the case now before the justices, New York City officials contended that the oversight \u201cimposes no undue burden on covered jurisdictions,\u201d saying that the process for submitting changes for federal approval is clear and routine, and that any change must be researched and documented anyway under state and local laws.         \n\nThe reason the city fell under the purview of the Voting Rights Act stems in part from an effort to assuage a growing sentiment that the South was being unfairly singled out when problems abounded elsewhere.         \n\nIn 1970, five years after the law was passed, Congress voted to extend the reach of the act. But in building the coalition needed for approval, a Kentucky senator \u2014 over the strenuous objections of Senator Jacob K. Javits of New York \u2014 pushed for it to include any part of the country that met the criteria. The first was the use of a test or device to discourage voters, like the English-language literacy test New York had adopted in 1921. Statewide, only the Bronx, Brooklyn and Manhattan met the second criterion, which was that fewer than half of the voting-age people were registered or voted in 1968.
