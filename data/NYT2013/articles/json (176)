{"headline": "U.S. Shift Poses Risk to Pakistan", "body": "\nFrom multibillion-dollar military aid to stealthy and secretive drone strikes,  \n, perhaps even more than  \n, has been the central focus of America\u2019s 12-year war on Islamist militancy.         \n\nNow, as  \n\u2019s landmark policy speech on Thursday made clear, all of that is changing. Drone strikes are dwindling, the war in Afghanistan is drawing to a close and the battle against Al Qaeda is receding.         \n\nPakistani leaders who have long demanded an American exit from their region may get their wish, but a broader disengagement is also likely to diminish the financing, prestige and political importance Pakistan held as a crucial player in global counterterrorism efforts, and could upset its internal stability.         \n\nThe diminution of the drone campaign may ease a major point of friction between Pakistan and the West, but the tribal belt in northwestern Pakistan, where about 360 drone strikes have landed in the past decade, remains a hotbed of Islamist militancy, largely outside government control. Although many senior leaders of Al Qaeda sheltering there have been felled by  \n missiles, they have been largely replaced by committed Pakistani jihadists with ties that span the border with Afghanistan.         \n\nWith American combat troops leaving Afghanistan in 2014, and the drone campaign already winding down in Pakistan, analysts fear that unless the Pakistani Army can assert itself conclusively, the tribal region could be plunged into deeper chaos.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a lot of trouble,\u201d said Hasan Askari-Rizvi, a Pakistani academic and defense analyst. \u201cIf the insurgency increases in Afghanistan, it will spill into Pakistan\u2019s tribal areas, where the  \n will become very confident.\u201d         \n\nFor 12 years, the United States\u2019 security-driven policy has shaped power, politics and militancy in Pakistan.         \n\nAfter 2001, Gen.  \n, who came to power in a military coup, established himself as a steadfast ally of the West; it underwrote his authoritarian rule, which lasted until 2008. The military received almost $17 billion in American military aid, and transfers of American military hardware, solidifying its position as the dominant arm of the state.         \n\nThat relationship has also fostered resentment, and some Pakistani leaders welcome an American disengagement.         \n\nThey blame America\u2019s muscular presence \u2014 expressed through troops in Afghanistan and espionage and drone operations in Pakistan \u2014 for an Islamist surge that has killed tens of thousands of Pakistanis, and they argue that it has been a recruiting tool for militant groups like the Pakistani Taliban.         \n\n\u201cLess American involvement is good, not bad,\u201d said Hina Rabbani Khar, who served as foreign minister in the last government, and who said she warmly welcomed the tone of Mr. Obama\u2019s speech on Thursday. \u201cDrones help us lose the war. And the ideological space for these terrorists is the supposed U.S. occupation of Afghanistan. Once that excuse is not there, these people will have to face the music.\u201d         \n\nAmerica\u2019s dogged pursuit of fugitives linked to Al Qaeda \u2014 first in Pakistan\u2019s cities, later in the tribal belt along the Afghan border \u2014 led to a two-faced policy toward Islamist militancy. Pakistani officials secretly accepted, and in some cases encouraged, the American drone program, while condemning it in public as a violation of sovereignty.         \n\nSimilarly, under pressure from Washington, Pakistan helped the C.I.A. arrest some jihadists, while it quietly sheltered other armed militant groups, like the Afghan Taliban and Lashkar-e-Taiba, who were seen as furthering Pakistani interests in Afghanistan and India.         \n\nThe American presence also created a giant blind spot in Pakistan\u2019s political psyche: with so much focus on American operations, Pakistani leaders used the United States as a scapegoat to avoid tackling some homegrown problems. Lurid tales of American espionage and other skulduggery abounded in the news media, promoted by politicians and mullahs but also fanned by real-life controversies like the shooting of two Pakistanis by the C.I.A. contractor Raymond Davis in January 2011.         \n\nNow that calculus is shifting for Pakistani policy makers. From now on, they will be less able to rely on the cloak-and-dagger workings of the drone program to have it both ways. Indeed, many fear a replay of the early 1990s when, after the departure of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, the United States withdrew abruptly, leaving behind a cadre of fired-up Islamist fighters, and then imposed sanctions on Pakistan for its  \n program.         \n\nBehind the bellicose speech, there is a complex dependency on both sides. While Pakistan\u2019s powerful generals have grown to resent the United States, they also lean on American military aid as a steady source of income in an economy so shaky it may soon require a bailout from the International Monetary Fund. The generals also rely on transfers of American military hardware to keep their fleet of F-16 fighters in the air.         \n\nGeneral Musharraf, the former president, recently admitted that he had secretly authorized American drone strikes in the tribal belt in the early days of the campaign, from 2004. Four years later, Pakistani officials quietly helped the United States assassinate Baitullah Mehsud, the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, in a missile attack.
