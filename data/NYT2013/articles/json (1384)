Music: uh ...         \n\nMusic often causes last-minute panic when entertaining. I know this because I\u2019m usually on the receiving end of frantic calls from friends asking to borrow my iPod with dinner-party playlists. This week\u2019s paired artists are always welcome guests at my dinner parties. Their silken blend of jazz and vocals provides a smooth undercurrent on which conversation can ride. Whom do you invite to your dinner party?         \n\n \n\n \n\n \n         \n\nBorn Eleanor Fagan in 1915, Billie Holiday had a  \n. On one hand: she grew up in brutal poverty, surviving bad relationships and racial cruelty. She was a teen-age prostitute, became a drug addict, battled poor health. On the other, she was one of the great celebrities of her time, an extraordinary talent, who collaborated with Benny Goodman, Duke Ellington and Count Basie. Her voice was as distinctive as the white gardenia she wore in her hair. Her big breakthrough came at age 20 when the jazz writer/producer John Hammond heard that voice. She was filling in for a better-known performer. He loved her slower tempo, husky blues vocals, her different rhythm. The saxophonist Lester Young and Holiday created some of the greatest jazz recordings of all time. She called him Prez; he called her Lady Day. As her music career took off, her emotional and physical health deteriorated. She was only 44 when she died. In the 1972 film \u201cLady Sings the Blues,\u201d Diana Ross stars as Holiday. Rock band U2\u2019s song \u201cAngel of Harlem\u201d is a tribute to Holiday. But really, the best way to get close to Holiday is to listen to her.         \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n         \n\nWhen I first heard  \nI couldn\u2019t help thinking of Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald and Edith Piaf. I was impressed that a contemporary singer was confident enough to venture into such lofty territory. Loved it. Her music is the perfect dinner party fare \u2014 and I\u2019m not talking Muzak, I\u2019m talking elegance. It's relaxed and subtle enough to let conversation rule, yet so fine your guests will take note. On an outing last week I walked into an antiques shop with classical music playing in the background; it fit perfectly. Later that day we hit some vintage/consignment shops, and Billie Holiday and, yes, Madeleine Peyroux were playing in the background. Indeed, Nate Chinen in The Times  \n as \"a small, distinctive thing with all the weathered charm of a flea-market antique.\"         \n\nBorn in Athens, Ga., Ms. Peyroux grew up in Southern California and Brooklyn, and at 13 moved to Paris with her mother. By 15, she was singing in the streets. Her first album, \"Dreamland\" (1996), and second album, \"Careless Love\" (2004) (one of my favorites) \u2014 are collections of cover songs by music greats like Patsy Cline, Leonard Cohen, Hank Williams, Bob Dylan and Piaf. Her fourth solo album, \"Bare Bones\" (2009), features only works she composed.         \n\nMs. Peyroux sings in a soft, husky voice, with minimal backup orchestration. Her album \u201cThe Blue Room,\u201d released last week, has a new crossover sound touching on country and pop.  \n, Charles Gans of The Associated Press writes that she \u201creturns as a masterful interpreter of classic songs.\u201d He continues: \"Half the 10 tunes \u2014 including 'Born to Lose,' 'You Don't Know Me' and 'I Can't Stop Loving You' \u2014 are from Ray Charles's two 1962 albums. But Peyroux's rich tone, emotional depth and expressive story telling ... seem more evocative of Patsy Cline's crossover country pop recordings from the same era.\" Ms. Peyroux keeps a low profile and eschews publicity. \u201cThe only thing that matters is the song,\u201d she says. And she sings such lovely songs, so well.         \n\nShe appears this week at the Tarrytown Music Hall in Westchester County (March 20); and Jazz at Lincoln Center, the Allen Room, (March 22 and 23).         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/21/booming/if-you-like-billie-holiday-try-madeleine-peyroux.html", "date": "2013-03-20", "description": "The music of Billie Holiday and Madeleine Peyroux can provide the perfect backdrop for dinner parties."}
