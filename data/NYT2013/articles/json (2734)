{"headline": "The Unstuffy Taco", "body": "\nThere is only one good way to eat a taco, and that is to eat it as soon as it has been assembled. No waiting, no fanfare and certainly not wrapped to go. It\u2019s all about immediacy, devouring it while it is still in prime shape.         \n\nThat\u2019s why some of the best tacos often come from a roving truck, or a similarly diminutive kitchen. There\u2019s no delay.         \n\nThe tacos I\u2019m talking about are not the least bit ornate, nor are they overstuffed. They are not piled high with lettuce, avocado and Cheddar. The ideal taco consists of a warm corn tortilla with a spoonful or two of a savory filling. If the tortillas are fresh and the filling (be it carnitas, lengua or frijoles) is well seasoned, that\u2019s all you need. O.K., perhaps a bit of salsa or crema, and maybe a sprinkling of queso fresco. With good ingredients, a taco like this can be exquisite, even if it\u2019s gone in three bites.         \n\nAnd that\u2019s just the point. A good taco or two can stave off hunger or accompany drinks, but doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be a proper meal. In Mexico, tacos are considered snacks. Open-air markets there are a great place to sample them before, after or in the midst of shopping. A restorative plate of three small tacos costs only a few pesos, and will keep you going until lunch.         \n\nThe choice of tortilla is especially important. I\u2019m not suggesting you make your own (though you could), but it\u2019s a good idea to buy high-quality tortillas. Most Latino groceries have them freshly made, often still warm in the package. Supermarket tortillas don\u2019t compare. Reheat them on a cast-iron griddle or pan, turning once or twice until they puff up a little, then serve at once.         \n\nAt my house, a taco feed is a bit like a pancake breakfast. Once the fillings and salsa are prepared, we elect one person to oversee heating the tortillas, ensuring they are hot, soft and steamy. The rest of us gratefully build our little tacos and gobble them down.
