{"headline": "The Great Old-Fashioned Debate", "body": "\nThere\u2019s a terrific mini-monologue in the 1942 film \u201cYou Were Never Lovelier\u201d in which Fred Astaire\u2019s fast-talking would-be rou\u00e9 tells Rita Hayworth\u2019s ing\u00e9nue: \u201cAs they\u2019d say in Brooklyn, I can\u2019t bat in your league. I\u2019m a plain, ordinary guy from Omaha, Nebraska. Just an old-fashioned, everyday Middle Westerner.. . . But you\u2019re streamlined. You\u2019re today. Sister, I was raised amongst the grasshoppers, I am strictly from corn.\u201d And then the duo breaks into song and dance, which is where Jerome Kern and Johnny Mercer\u2019s sublime ballad, \u201cI\u2019m Old Fashioned,\u201d debuted.         \n\nFor me, the song and the drink (which predates it by a very long time; the name dates to around the 1880s, but the recipe\u2019s essentials go back to at least 1806) go together perfectly. And even Astaire\u2019s brief speech seems to telegraph the big question among old-fashioned drinkers: Which way are you going to have it \u2014 streamlined or strictly from corn?         \n\nNo cocktail (and this includes the martini) gets people as worked up about methodology as the old-fashioned. And that\u2019s probably because the two major approaches really are quite different. One is starkly minimalist, prescribing nothing more than sugar, whiskey and bitters \u2014  \n a few teardrops\u2019 worth of water,  \n a twist of orange or lemon to finish it off. Like Hayworth, it\u2019s streamlined, it\u2019s today (even if it is one of the oldest cocktails on record). It\u2019s certainly not the old-fashioned I was taught to make at a bar in small-town Vermont in the early 1990s. There, the first time a customer ordered the drink from me, I skulked over to the manager to ask what to do. She plonked a sugar cube, a slice of orange and a cherry in a glass, dug what looked like a small nightstick out of a drawer, handed it to me as if I had any idea what to do with it and told me to add whiskey, Angostura bitters and ice. I did figure out what to do with the muddler, and that drink \u2014 the sweet and fruity, eager-to-please, raised among the grasshoppers, strictly from corn, boisterous version \u2014 instantly became my old-fashioned.         \n\nI wouldn\u2019t encounter its austere twin for more than a decade, at an East Village bar, where at the time I assumed they had just run out of fruit. But as more years piled on, I noticed that this version had ascended. It had become to many the one, the true, the correct way to drink it. I get it. It\u2019s a lovely, restrained drink, so pared-down as to feel elemental. But I like the other, more gregarious kind too. And ultimately, what I\u2019ve discovered I like best of all is essentially a hybrid \u2014 like the version from Kenneth McCoy, a bartender and owner at Ward III in TriBeCa ( \n). At his dad\u2019s bar in Manhattan, they were made much as I was taught to in Vermont, and affection for that fruit-forward flavor abides, with a little adjusting.         \n\nAfter all, this year\u2019s fancies, the song tells us, are passing fancies.
