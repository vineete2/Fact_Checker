{"headline": "Reliving Horror and Faint Hope at Massacre Site", "body": "\nNEWTOWN, Conn. \u2014 The gunfire ended; it was so quiet they could hear the broken glass and bullet casings scraping under their boots. The smell of gunpowder filled the air. The officers turned down their radios; they did not want to give away their positions if there was still a gunman present.         \n\nThey found the two women first, their bodies lying on the lobby floor. Now they knew it was real. But nothing, no amount of training, could prepare them for what they found next, inside those two classrooms.         \n\n\u201cOne look, and your life was absolutely changed,\u201d said Michael McGowan, one of the first police officers to arrive at  \n on Dec. 14, as a gunman, in the space of minutes, killed 20 first graders and 6 adults.         \n\nOfficer McGowan was among seven Newtown officers who recently sat down to share their accounts of that day. Some spoke for the first time, providing the fullest account yet of the scene as officers responded to one of the worst school massacres in United States history, one that has inflamed the national debate over gun control.         \n\nIt is an account filled with ghastly moments and details, and a few faint instances of hope. One child had a slight pulse, but did not survive. Another was found bloody but unhurt, amid her dead classmates. Teachers were so protective of their students that they had to be coaxed by officers before opening doors. And the officers themselves, many of them fathers, instinctively used their most soothing Daddy voices to guide terrified children to safety.         \n\nThe stories also reveal the deep stress that lingers for officers who, until Dec. 14, had focused their energies on maintaining order in a low-crime corner of suburbia. Some can barely sleep. Little things can set off tears: a television show, a child\u2019s laughter, even the piles of gifts the Police Department received from across the country.         \n\nOne detective, who was driving with his wife and two sons, passed a roadside memorial on Route 25 two weeks after the shooting, and began sobbing uncontrollably. \u201cI just lost it right there, I couldn\u2019t even drive,\u201d the detective, Jason Frank, said.         \n\nOfficer William Chapman was in the Newtown police station along with Officer McGowan and others when the first reports of shots and breaking glass came in early on the day of the massacre. The school was more than two miles away. They traveled up Route 25, then right onto Church Hill Road. \u201cWe drove as fast as we\u2019ve ever driven,\u201d Officer McGowan said.         \n\nThey made it in under three minutes, arriving in the parking lot while gunfire could still be heard.         \n\n\u201cI got out of the car and grabbed my rifle and it stopped for second,\u201d Officer Chapman said. \u201cBut then we heard more popping. You could tell it was rifle fire. And it was up so close, it sounded like it was coming from outside. So we were all looking around for someone to shoot back at.\u201d         \n\nAs the officers converged on the building, the gunfire stopped again. Officers Chapman and Scott Smith made their way to the front entrance. It was here, only minutes earlier, that a rail-thin 20-year-old named  \n, armed with a .223 Bushmaster semiautomatic carbine, two semiautomatic pistols and hundreds of rounds of ammunition, had blasted his way through the glass.         \n\nLeonard Penna, a school resource officer who had raced to the scene from his office at the Newtown Middle School, entered the school with Sgt. Aaron Bahamonde and Lt. Christopher Vanghele, through a side door that leads to the boiler room, he said. Officer McGowan and two other officers entered through a locked rear door. One of them knocked out the glass with his rifle butt so the rest of the officers could get in.         \n\nThe halls were familiar to Officer McGowan. He attended the school as a child. But now, they were eerily silent.         \n\n\u201cThe teachers were doing a phenomenal job keeping their kids quiet,\u201d Officer Chapman said.         \n\nThe officers turned their radios down. They entered the front lobby and saw the first bodies, those of Dawn Hochsprung, the principal, they would later learn, and Mary Sherlach, the school psychologist.         \n\n\u201cYou saw them lifeless, laying down,\u201d Officer Penna recalled. \u201cFor a split second, your mind says could this be a mock crime scene, could this be fake, but in the next split second, you\u2019re saying, there is no way. This is real.\u201d         \n\nThe officers went from room to room, urgently hunting for the killer before he could do more harm.         \n\nThey found a wounded staff member in one room, made sure her co-workers were applying proper first aid and moved on.
