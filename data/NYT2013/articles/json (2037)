{"headline": "Quitting the N.F.L.: For John Moffitt, the Money Wasn\u2019t Worth It", "body": "\nSEATTLE \u2014 John Moffitt chugged mugs of black coffee and talked almost giddily about how, the week before, he called John Elway, the head of football operations for the  \n, to tell him he was quitting the  \n, leaving behind the money and the fame, but also the constant pain and the danger.         \n\nIn parts of three seasons as a guard with the  \n and the Broncos, Moffitt, 27, blew out his knee, had elbow surgery and hurt his shoulders. Sleep apnea left him exhausted. Floaters cross his vision from all the hits to the head he absorbed in his nearly 20 years of playing football.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to risk health for money,\u201d said Moffitt, who walked away from about $1 million in salary, various benefits for retirees who play at least three seasons and quite possibly a trip to the Super Bowl with the 9-1 Broncos. \u201cI\u2019m happy, and I don\u2019t need the N.F.L.\u201d         \n\nMost weeks, the departure of a player like Moffitt, who played sporadically and often anonymously on the offensive line, would have warranted barely a footnote among fans and general managers, and his spot on the roster would have been quickly filled by an eager replacement.         \n\nBut Moffitt quit the same week that the N.F.L. was consumed by allegations of bullying on the Miami Dolphins and disturbing reports that the former Dallas Cowboys running back Tony Dorsett and other retired stars might have early onset degenerative brain disease.         \n\nThe heightened awareness of football\u2019s physical tolls has prompted hundreds of former players to express regret over what the sport did to their bodies.\u00a0Yet Moffitt is unique for openly discussing his injuries and the brutal reality of playing in the N.F.L.\u00a0         \n\n\u201cThey are merchandising human beings, let\u2019s be honest,\u201d said Moffitt,\u00a0who at a cafe in Pike Place Market in Seattle reveled in his freedom much like the Tim Robbins character in \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption,\u201d who, after breaking out of jail, rips off his shirt in the rain and laughs at the sky.         \n\nIn a far-reaching interview last week, Moffitt described how his decision to leave the N.F.L., a level he worked so hard to reach, was far from rash, even though he announced it on Twitter and was accused online of being impulsive and na\u00efve.         \n\nQuitting, he said, had little to do with his diminished playing time, though he suited up for only two games this season, or any dissatisfaction with the Seahawks or Broncos organizations, which he said treated him well.         \n\nRather, it was the culmination of months of reflection that his once-promising career had been derailed by injuries, and that continuing to play for the money and to please others would very likely ruin his health further and deepen his gloom.         \n\nIn the off-season, after battling for playing time and trying to stay fit, Moffitt, a free spirit who idolizes Jim Morrison, started reading the writings of the Dalai Lama and Noam Chomsky, among others. They helped him conclude that he was a pawn in a machine that controlled his life and that he no longer wanted to meet the expectations attached to that life.         \n\n\u201cYou kind of let go of that dream that you kill yourself for, to be a millionaire, and you see through it and see that it\u2019s just a facade,\u201d said Moffitt, who was dressed in baggy jeans, T-shirt, work boots and black pea coat. \u201cI let go of all that stuff.\u201d         \n\nMoffitt returned to training camp harboring doubts. In August, the Seahawks traded him to Cleveland, but the deal was reversed because the Browns said they had concerns about his health. Moffitt said the Browns voided the trade because he refused to take a pay cut, something the team denied.         \n\nSo, the Seahawks traded Moffitt to the Broncos, for whom he had an opportunity to protect Peyton Manning, probably the N.F.L.\u2019s biggest star. To outsiders, it was a dream job with a near-certain trip to the playoffs. But the trade only confirmed to Moffitt that he did not control his destiny.         \n\n\u201cHis love of the game changed because it\u2019s a business in the N.F.L.,\u201d his father, Dave Moffitt, said. \u201cThe minute he signed, I told him: You\u2019re John Moffitt Inc. The rah-rah is great for the fans, but you have to treat yourself as a business.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/19/sports/football/quitting-the-nfl-for-john-moffitt-the-money-wasnt-worth-it.html", "date": "2013-11-18", "description": "John Moffitt, who walked away from about $1 million in salary from the 9-1 Broncos, said continuing to play for money was likely to injure him further and deepen his gloom."}
