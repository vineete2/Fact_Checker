{"headline": "In Search of Energy Miracles", "body": "\nAt a legendary but secretive laboratory in California, Lockheed Martin is working on a plan that some employees hope might transform the world\u2019s energy system: a practicable type of nuclear fusion.         \n\nSome 900 miles to the north, Bill Gates and another Microsoft veteran, Nathan Myhrvold, have poured millions into a company developing a fission reactor that could run on today\u2019s nuclear waste.         \n\nAnd on the far side of the world, China has seized on discarded American research to pursue a safer reactor based on an abundant element called thorium.         \n\nBeyond the question of whether they will work, these ambitious schemes pose a larger issue: How much faith should we, as a society, put in the idea of a big technological fix to save the world from  \n?         \n\nA lot of smart people are coming to see the energy problem as the defining challenge of the 21st century. We have to supply power and transportation to an eventual population of 10 billion people who deserve decent lives, and we have to do it while limiting the emissions that threaten our collective future.         \n\nYet we have  \n so much carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere that huge, threatening changes to the world\u2019s climate appear to be inevitable. And instead of slowing down, emissions are speeding up as billions of once-destitute people claw their way out of poverty, powered by fossil fuels.         \n\nMany environmentalists believe that wind and  \n can be scaled to meet the rising demand, especially if coupled with aggressive efforts to cut waste. But a lot of energy analysts have crunched the numbers and concluded that today\u2019s renewables, important as they are, cannot get us even halfway there.         \n\n\u201cWe need energy miracles,\u201d Mr. Gates said in a  \n three years ago introducing his approach, embodied in a company called  \n.         \n\nA variety of new technologies might help. Bright young folks in American universities are working on better ways to store electricity, which could solve many of the problems associated with renewable power. Work has even begun on futuristic technologies that might cheaply pull carbon dioxide out of the air.         \n\nBut because of the pressing need for thousands of large generating stations that emit no carbon dioxide while providing electricity day and night, many technologists keep returning to potential improvements in nuclear power.         \n\nAfter all, despite its many problems, it is the one low-carbon energy source that we know can work on a very large scale. France gets 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear reactors.         \n\nPerhaps Mr. Gates can find a way forward. He is the world\u2019s second-richest man and surely the premier American technologist of the era, following the death of Steve Jobs.         \n\nHis partner in TerraPower is  \n, the former chief technology officer at Microsoft. Adept in geophysics, space physics, mathematics, economics, paleontology and gastronomy, Mr. Myhrvold is the man behind a $600 cookbook called \u201c \n\u201d and a slew of other wildly inventive projects.         \n\nTheir plan is to build something called a  \n. In principle, it could operate safely for a half-century or more without refueling, and could run on material that has been discarded from today\u2019s reactors as hazardous waste, solving several problems at once.         \n\nThey have persuaded an energy veteran,  \n, to run the company; he employs about 60 people and is laying plans to build a prototype reactor.         \n\n\u201cWe sensed that nuclear had not been pushed in an innovative sense for some time,\u201d Mr. Gilleland said. \u201cNo one had taken 21st-century technology and modeling capabilities and just sort of started over.\u201d         \n\nTheir method, like that of existing reactors, is based on  \n, or splitting heavy atoms, then using the resulting heat to spin turbines and make electricity.         \n\nLockheed Martin is pursuing a more difficult course:  \n. It involves fusing hydrogen variants into heavier elements, similar to the reaction that powers the sun.         \n\nThe company will not say much about the program under way at its legendary  \n facility in California, which developed the U-2 spy plane. But in  \n this year, a leader of the program,  \n, suggested it was aiming for small, modular fusion reactors that could be built in factories.         \n\nMr. Chase and his colleagues face long odds: 60 years of research on fusion has produced more disappointment than progress. \u201cThere\u2019s really only one guarantee, and that\u2019s if we don\u2019t try, nothing is going to happen,\u201d Mr. Chase said in his talk.         \n\nAmong the new nuclear approaches, fission reactors based on  \n are especially intriguing, offering potentially huge safety advantages. The basic concepts were proved in research by the American nuclear establishment in the 1960s, but the idea was ultimately abandoned by the Nixon administration in favor of a riskier approach called breeder reactors, which turned into an $8 billion black hole.         \n\nAn engineer in Alabama,  \n, has helped excavate the  \n and founded his own tiny company,  \n, to push it forward. But it will surprise no one to hear that China is ahead of the United States on this, with hundreds of engineers  \n.         \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re doing laps around the track, and we haven\u2019t even decided if we\u2019re going to lace up our shoes,\u201d Mr. Sorensen said.         \n\nYet not even the speedy Chinese are likely to get a sizable reactor built before the 2020s, and that is true for the other nuclear projects as well. So even if these technologies prove to work, it would not be surprising to see the timeline for widespread deployment slip to the 2030s or the 2040s. And climate scientists tell us it would be folly to wait that long to start tackling the emissions problem.         \n\nTwo approaches to the issue \u2014 spending money on the technologies we have now, or investing in future breakthroughs \u2014 are sometimes portrayed as conflicting. In reality, that is a false dichotomy. The smartest experts say we have to pursue both tracks at once, and much more aggressively than we have been doing.         \n\nAn ambitious national climate policy, anchored by a stiff price on carbon dioxide emissions, would serve both goals at once. In the short run, it would hasten a trend of supplanting coal-burning power plants with natural gas plants, which emit less carbon dioxide. It would drive investment into current low-carbon technologies like wind and solar power that, while not efficient enough, are steadily improving.         \n\nAnd it would also raise the economic rewards for developing new technologies that could disrupt and displace the ones of today. These might be new-age nuclear reactors, vastly improved solar cells, or something entirely unforeseen.         \n\nIn effect, our national policy now is to sit on our hands hoping for energy miracles, without doing much to call them forth. While we dawdle, maybe the Chinese will develop a nice business selling us thorium reactors based on our old designs. For communists, they do have an entrepreneurial bent.\u00a0         \n\nBut surely we would all feel better about the future if the full creative power of American capitalism were unleashed on the climate problem.
