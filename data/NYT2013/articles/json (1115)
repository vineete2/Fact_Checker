{"headline": "Bob Dylan: Musician or Poet?", "body": "\nEach week in Bookends, two writers take on pressing and provocative questions about the world of books. This week, Dana Stevens and Francine Prose discuss whether Bob Dylan\u2019s lyrics make him more poet than musician.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \nDana Stevens \n\nLike the handful of artists in whose company he belongs, Bob Dylan takes the notion of genre and cheerfully chucks it into the wood chipper. Is Shakespeare a poet or a dramatist \u2014 or, to descend into the smaller subcategories into which genre can never seem to stop fracturing, a comedian, a tragedian or a historian? Did Buster Keaton leave his mark primarily as an actor, a director, a stuntman or a clown? When Michael Jackson performed the moonwalk on television for the first time, did the crowd go into rapture because of his dancing, singing, songwriting or choreography?         \n\nCreative activity at a certain level renders genre categorization moot. Or rather, it pushes \u201cgenre\u201d back toward its origin in an Indo-European root denoting procreation, \u201cengendering\u201d in the most literal sense. Dylan\u2019s songs at their best seem to originate from some primal foundry of creation, a Devil\u2019s crossroads where Delta blues, British folk ballads, French Symbolism and Beat poetry (to name only a few of his early influences) converge and fuse.         \n\nBut his music reaches forward in time, toward more modern art forms, as well. There\u2019s something distinctly cinematic, for example, in the crosscutting and temporal leaps of a narrative ballad like \u201cTangled Up in Blue,\u201d which compresses a feature film\u2019s worth of images, locations and encounters into four and a half minutes of bravura storytelling. If it\u2019s a kind of sung movie, \u201cTangled Up in Blue\u201d is one that, like so many Dylan compositions, consciously aspires to the condition of literature. In one verse, an erudite topless-bar waitress hands the first-person narrator \u2014 or in some versions of the song, a third-person stand-in \u2014 a life-changing volume of verse by \u201can Italian poet / From the 13th century.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t yet the poet musician that I would become,\u201d Dylan writes of his early folk-singing days in his memoir \u201cChronicles: Volume 1\u201d (a vivid, surprisingly chatty book that nonetheless manages to disclose almost nothing about its strategically elliptical author, and that points to yet another potential career path: Dylan as prose writer). But elsewhere he has repudiated both those roles, most famously in a 1965 press conference in which \u2014 asked the same question that appears above this column \u2014 he laughed and replied, \u201cOh, I think of myself more as a song and dance man, y\u2019know.\u201d         \n\nThat modesty, false or not, hasn\u2019t kept us from trying to understand for the past five decades just what, exactly, Bob Dylan is, or from throwing ever-heavier symbolic mantles over his bony shoulders: prophet, shaman, enigma, bard. The more he evades definition, the more grandiose the titles we devise, all the while romanticizing his ability to keep us at a permanent distance. His very undecidability as a cultural figure \u2014 the sense that we, and he, haven\u2019t quite grasped what he\u2019s up to \u2014 is a mark of how much Dylan has given us as a \u2014 well, as whatever kind of artist he is. It\u2019s too early to perceive the full scope of his contribution, and he\u2019s not done changing yet.         \n\nThe title of his fourth album, \u201cAnother Side of Bob Dylan,\u201d seems funny 50 years and countless recordings later: How could we have known then that the man would turn out to have more sides than a mirrored disco ball? But it\u2019s Dylan\u2019s vision of his role as primarily that of an entertainer, a \u201csong and dance man,\u201d that perhaps drives the nonstop touring that\u2019s dominated his life for the past two and a half decades. (Since 1988, he\u2019s averaged more than 100 shows a year, with the longest stretch off the road only three consecutive months during a health scare in 1997.) For at least a decade, Dylan\u2019s stage manager has introduced nearly every show with a florid, possibly ironic short speech identifying the singer as \u201cthe poet laureate of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. The voice of the promise of \u201860s counterculture.\u201d Then the poet comes out and does his song and dance.         \n\n \n         \n\n\u25c6 \u25c6 \u25c6         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \nFrancine Prose", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/22/books/review/bob-dylan-musician-or-poet.html", "date": "2013-12-17", "description": "Dana Stevens and Francine Prose discuss whether Bob Dylan\u2019s lyrics make him more poet than musician."}
