{"headline": "A Cellar for Any Situation, Any Price", "body": "\nYou don\u2019t need me to remind you the holidays are here (as if you could forget). While it\u2019s easy to bemoan the crass commercialization and artifice, it\u2019s also easy to overlook the opportunities for all sorts of gatherings and the real joys that come with them. Let\u2019s just stipulate that in the hierarchy of pleasures,  \n. Now that we agree on that, good food and drink can help make any party better. Here are some suggestions for several possible types of gatherings. The suggestions are not rigid: if you see something you like better in another, go for it. Above all, these should be gifts to yourself.         \n\n \n         \n\n\u201cLove is all around,\u201d as they sing in \u201cLove, Actually,\u201d one of my favorite Christmas movies (another is \u201cThe Ref,\u201d not nearly so sentimental). Why not take advantage with a special dinner for two? Whatever menu you decide, sparkling wine to start is a must. You could drink it throughout the meal, or switch to red or white, or both. Don\u2019t worry about finishing, just seal and pop the extras in the fridge. If all goes well, you may want to continue the celebration the day after.         \n\n \n France is awash in good sparkling wine, whether from Vouvray, Burgundy or Alsace. \u00c9motion, a Cr\u00e9mant d\u2019Alsace from Domaine Agap\u00e9, is about $20.         \n\n \n Michel Loriot makes a terrific R\u00e9serve Brut Champagne for about $35. Louis Roederer Brut Premier is an excellent mainstream Champagne for about $40.         \n\n \n Taittinger Comte de Champagne, a superb blanc de blancs, may be the most undervalued t\u00e8te de cuvee, about $125.         \n\n \n C\u00e9line et Laurent Tripoz make a delicious Brut Nature Cr\u00e9mant de Bourgogne, for around $20.         \n\n \n How about an assyrtiko from Santorini in the Greek islands? Argyros, Sigalas and Gaia all make good ones for about $20.         \n\n \n Perhaps a lovely, lightly sweet yet tense sp\u00e4tlese riesling from Germany? Willi Schaefer, Joh. Jos. Christoffel, G\u00fcnther Steinmetz, A.J. Adam all make excellent bottles for $30 to $40.         \n\n \n Great white Bordeaux is a secret weapon. Domaine de Chevalier is a favorite for around $125.         \n\n \n Is chenin blanc geeky? Some think so. I think it\u2019s beautiful. Try a great Vouvray from Vincent Car\u00eame for $20 to $30.         \n\n \n The 2011 cru Beaujolais are great. Look for a Juli\u00e9nas from Michel T\u00eate\u2019s Domaine du Clos du Fief for $20 or so.         \n\n \n I love the lithe, graceful nerello mascaleses from Mount Etna in Sicily. Calabretta, Terre Nere, Benanti are all around $30.         \n\n \n This is the place for Burgundy or Barolo with a few years of age. For Burgundies, look for good premier crus from 2000, 2001 or 2006. For Barolo, look for \u201999, \u201998 and, if you\u2019re lucky, \u201995 or \u201993.         \n\n \n         \n\nUsually, the kids are in school or away at college and you\u2019re working and lucky if you can get something hot and nutritious on the table for the 20 minutes that people will hold still. Now it slows down, the perfect opportunity to take a more rewarding emotionally and culinary approach to dinner. Fine wine for the grown-ups, a taste for the kids, hot mulled cider for afterward.         \n\n \n Savory Etna biancos can be as good as the reds. Benanti\u2019s is around $20.         \n\n \n German rieslings are great dry, too. Look for Karth\u00e4userhof, Von Racknitz, Knebel and D\u00f6nnhoff, $25 to $40.         \n\n \n 2010 Meursault from Fichet, Colin-Morey, Roulot or Lafon, from $75.         \n\n \n Old-school white Rioja. The \u201998 reserva Vi\u00f1a Tondonia from Lop\u00e9z de Heredia is about $40.         \n\n \n Pleasantly bitter Dolcettos from the Piedmont region of Italy. Anna-Maria Abbona or Luigi Einaudi are about $20.         \n\n \n A spicy Montsant from Celler de Cap\u00e7anes for about $25, or an earthy St.-Joseph from Domaine Faury, about $30.         \n\n \n Classic Napa cabernets with a little age, like Cathy Corison or Mayacamas, around $100.         \n\n \n In C\u00f4t We Trust is Puzelat-Bonhomme\u2019s indefatigable take on Loire malbec, $20.         \n\n \n         \n\nYou\u2019ve got your dedicated wine friends, for whom no gathering is complete if not centered around a few interesting bottles. Perhaps you\u2019ve heard about a new generation of winemakers in California who are conscientiously working to extend the state\u2019s bandwidth, making wines that aim more for subtlety and finesse than power and bountiful fruit. How about a New California party? You could supplement with a gift of \u201cThe New California Wine,\u201d Jon Bonn\u00e9\u2019s fine new book that explores the phenomenon. Forget the Geeky category; it all qualifies.         \n\n \n Martian Ranch makes good albari\u00f1o in Santa Barbara County, about $20.         \n\n \n Matthiasson Napa Valley White, about $40.         \n\n \n Kongsgaard The Judge, not exactly new wave but wonderful chardonnay, $150 or more.         \n\n \n Broadside Margarita Vineyard, excellent cabernet from Paso Robles, about $20.         \n\n \n Arnot-Roberts North Coast syrah, about $30.         \n\n \n Rhys single-vineyard pinot noirs from the Santa Cruz Mountains, $75 or so.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/18/dining/a-cellar-for-any-situation-any-price.html", "date": "2013-12-12", "description": "Wine suggestions for several possible types of holiday gatherings, from romantic dinners for two to football takeout."}
