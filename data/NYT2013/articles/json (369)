{"headline": "New Leak Indicates Britain and U.S. Tracked Diplomats", "body": "\nA new set of classified documents disclosed Sunday suggested that Edward J. Snowden, the former  \n contractor who has provided a trove of documents to The Guardian newspaper, had obtained a wider range of materials about government surveillance than had been known, including one document revealing how American and British intelligence agencies had eavesdropped on world leaders at conferences in London in 2009.         \n\nThe latest disclosures, appearing again in The Guardian, came the night before a meeting of the Group of 8 industrialized nations was to open in Northern Ireland, where some of the leaders who were intelligence targets four years ago will be in attendance.         \n\nThe newspaper reported Sunday night that Government Communications Headquarters, or G.C.H.Q., the British eavesdropping agency that works closely with the N.S.A., monitored the e-mail and phones of other countries\u2019 representatives at two London conferences, in part by setting up a monitored Internet cafe for the participants. In addition, the United States intercepted the communications of Dmitri A. Medvedev, then the Russian president and now the prime minister, the newspaper said.         \n\nThe Guardian posted some G.C.H.Q.  \n on its Web site with part of the contents blacked out. A spokesman for The Guardian said Sunday that the paper decided to redact the documents, and that enough was published \u201cto show the authenticity of the report.\u201d         \n\nThe documents indicated that e-mail interception and key-logging software was installed on the computers in the ersatz Internet cafe, that foreign diplomats\u2019 BlackBerry messages and calls were intercepted, and that 45 analysts tracked who was phoning whom at the meeting.         \n\nRichard J. Aldrich, a professor of international security at the University of Warwick and the author of a history of the G.C.H.Q., said the logos of the N.S.A. and Canadian intelligence on one of the British documents suggested that they were accessible to Mr. Snowden \u201cunder the auspices of a joint program.\u201d         \n\nHe said Mr. Snowden\u2019s leak showed that British and American diplomats and politicians got a real-time feed of intelligence on their counterparts at major summit meetings. \u201cNow this is integrated into summit diplomacy, almost like a newsreader getting a feed in their ear,\u201d he said.         \n\nAmerican intelligence officials have expressed alarm at the variety of highly classified material Mr. Snowden obtained, suggesting that his actions revealed a shocking breach in the fundamental principle that intelligence officers should have access only to the material they need to do their jobs. On Sunday, a spokesman for the British foreign service said he would not comment on intelligence matters.         \n\nMr. Snowden, 29, who left the N.S.A. station in Hawaii this spring and is now thought to be hiding in Hong Kong, delivered hundreds of N.S.A. documents to The Guardian and The Washington Post. Their initial reports covered the routine collection of data on all phone calls handled by the major American telephone companies and an N.S.A. program called Prism that collects the e-mails and other Web activity of foreigners using major Internet services like Google, Yahoo and Facebook.         \n\nDisclosures linked to Mr. Snowden now rank among the most significant breaches in the strict secrecy of the N.S.A., the largest American intelligence agency, since its creation in 1952. It suffered a handful of defections during the cold war; more recently, insiders have revealed warrantless eavesdropping inside the United States.         \n\nBy contrast, the latest disclosures have exposed surveillance approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and shared with Congress.         \n\nA letter delivered to Congress on Saturday from the office of James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, said that the surveillance programs had helped thwart \u201cdozens\u201d of terrorist plots in the United States and more than 20 other countries.         \n\nWhile the N.S.A. collects and stores the phone records of millions of Americans each year, it examines the records only when there is suspicion of a connection to terrorism, the letter said, adding that in 2012, fewer than 300 phone records were reviewed.         \n\nThe Guardian\u2019s latest reports offered a rare window onto the everyday electronic spying that the agency does in close cooperation with  \n, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.         \n\nMatthew M. Aid, an intelligence historian in Washington, said the reports have \u201cconfirmed longstanding suspicions that N.S.A\u2019s surveillance in this country is far more intrusive than we knew.\u201d He added, \u201cWe desperately need to have a public discussion about the proper limits on N.S.A.\u201d         \n\nBut he said the reports of spying on world leaders, while distressing to the eavesdroppers because it will make their targets more wary, contained no surprises. \u201cThis is just what intelligence agencies do \u2014 spy on friends and enemies alike,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly because the shroud of secrecy that covers all of N.S.A. operations is so thick does a glimpse like this come as a shock.\u201d         \n\nWhile some members of Congress have raised questions about the sweep of the N.S.A.\u2019s collection of data on Americans, leaders of both parties have defended the programs and denounced Mr. Snowden before The Guardian published its latest report.         \n\nAppearing on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d former Vice President Dick Cheney praised the agency and called Mr. Snowden a criminal and a traitor. \u201cI think it\u2019s one of the worst occasions in my memory of somebody with access to classified information doing enormous damage to the national security interests of the United States,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe White House chief of staff, Denis McDonough, appearing on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on CBS, said leaking information about American surveillance \u201cin effect gives the playbook to those who would like to get around our techniques and our practices, and obviously that\u2019s not in our interest in the long haul.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/17/world/europe/new-leak-indicates-us-and-britain-eavesdropped-at-09-world-conferences.html", "date": "2013-06-16", "description": "A disclosure of documents obtained by Edward J.
