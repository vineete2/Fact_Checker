Lavrov, was the first to go to Geneva and arrived Friday afternoon.         \n\nEarlier on Friday, Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said that a major stumbling block involved what constraints to impose on Iran\u2019s effort to build a heavy water reactor near the town of Arak that would produce plutonium.         \n\n\u201cWe still disagree on three or four points, the most important of which seems to be the heavy-water reactor in Arak,\u201d Mr. Zarif said, according to Tasnim, an Iranian news agency.         \n\nA senior European diplomat also said this afternoon that Arak was a sticking point and that some issues also remained pertaining to enrichment.         \n\n\u201cThey made some good progress this afternoon but not enough to guarantee a deal,\u201d the European official said. \u201cThere are many options on the table for the Iranians that would allow them to claim a measure of victory. The issue is do the Iranians feel that at home this looks all right.\u201d         \n\nMr. Zarif met with Ms. Ashton, who has served as the main interlocutor for the world powers, Friday morning and again Friday afternoon. Negotiations looked set to continue Friday evening.         \n\nAs the round began earlier this week a major sticking point was Iran\u2019s insistence that world powers acknowledge its \u201cright\u201d to enrich uranium. A senior Obama administration official suggested last week that a solution could be found on this question.         \n\nUnder the expected compromise Iran would continue to enrich uranium to a level of 3.5 percent but the United States and Iran would essentially agree to disagree whether the Iranians have such a right under the nuclear nonproliferation treaty.         \n\nRegarding Iran\u2019s plutonium production program, Mr. Kerry said earlier this month that the United States was asking Iran, as part of an interim accord, to agree to a \u201ccomplete freeze over where they are today\u201d and that the reactor Iran is building at Arak would be covered by the agreement.         \n\nThe French have been particularly adamant that stringent limits be imposed on the project and it is not known what specific limits world powers have proposed.         \n\nOnce the reactor at Arak is operational, which could happen as early as next year, it might be difficult to disable it through a military strike without risking the dispersal of nuclear material. That risk would eliminate one of the West\u2019s options for responding to Iran, should it pursue a nuclear weapon, and thus reduce its leverage in the negotiations.         \n\nIn return for an interim agreement, the United States would provide about $6 billion to $7 billion in sanctions relief.
