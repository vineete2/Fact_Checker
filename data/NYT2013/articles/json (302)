{"headline": "A Gay Man Finds a Sixth Sense Declining With Age", "body": "\nMy eyesight isn\u2019t what it used to be. (I buy reading glasses online, for $2 a pair, and stash them all over the house.) And my hearing isn\u2019t as sharp as it once was. (True story: When I asked my doctor if hearing loss at the upper frequencies was a serious problem, he said \u2014 with the comic timing of a man who has used the line before \u2014 \u201cOnly if you want to hear women.\u201d)         \n\nBut it\u2019s not the lack of hearing and eyesight that is bothering me lately. It\u2019s the lack of a sixth sense, the one sometimes called gaydar.         \n\nWhen I was single, gaydar was what enabled me to enter a room and decide if there was someone there I might want to share my life with. Now that I\u2019m married (11 years), it\u2019s what enables me to enter a room and decide if there\u2019s someone there I might want to share a joke with (if the joke is one that I think only another gay man would appreciate).         \n\nGaydar was what enabled me to figure out who in the world was on \u201cmy team.\u201d         \n\nIs it surprising that a gay man would want to know who shares his sexual preference-slash-orientation? Not to me, since I grew up surrounded by Jewdar \u2014 the ability, on the part of my parents, aunts, uncles, grandparents \u2014 to suss out who was Jewish. The subject obsessed them; the day they discovered that Michael Landon, of \u201cBonanza\u201d fame, was really Eugene Maurice Orowitz from Queens, was like an extra night of Hanukkah. It\u2019s natural to want to know who is part of your tribe, especially if your tribe is small, occasionally invisible and more than occasionally oppressed.         \n\nBut my gaydar was never perfect. I\u2019ve tagged straight men as gay. (Though they were honest mistakes \u2014 not wishful thinking.) More often, I\u2019ve thought gay men were straight, usually based on prejudices (\u201cAn orthodontist? Gay? Never!\u201d) that I would not have tolerated in anyone else.         \n\nBut my gaydar, like my eyesight and my hearing, has declined with age. And there are, so far as I know, no devices (akin to glasses or hearing aids) to help me.         \n\nWhy has my gaydar tanked? Well, for one thing, styles have changed. There are straight men who wear the kinds of clothes that might have been considered \u201cgay\u201d just a few years ago. Categorizing people based on their attire has become a tricky business, and not just for me, but for everyone.         \n\nOr it could be my eyesight. Earlier this year, scientists reported that subjects could  \n (as opposed to the mere 50 percent predicted by random guessing) based on clues in the spacing of facial features.         \n\nBut in my view, the real reason my gaydar has failed is that there is no such thing as gaydar. No item of clothing, speech pattern, hairstyle or career choice (or even facial topography) is enough to identify someone as gay. In reality, the way you know, when you enter a room, if another man is gay is by seeing how he looks at you. If he maintains eye contact a split second longer than he needs to, or gives you a once-over, he\u2019s gay. After all, those are things a man does if he\u2019s interested in what he sees.         \n\nSo if I don\u2019t have much gaydar anymore, it may be that not many men I come across are interested in what they see.         \n\nIn other words: At 55, I\u2019ve become invisible to them, so they\u2019ve become invisible to me. If they won\u2019t check me out, I can\u2019t check them off.         \n\nIs it a loss? Walking into a room and not knowing who is gay is like walking into a room and not knowing who is Jewish (something my mother would have hated). It makes it harder to maneuver, socially, but so do my declining eyesight and inability to hear high voices. Why should the sixth sense be any different from the other five?
