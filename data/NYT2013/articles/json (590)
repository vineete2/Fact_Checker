{"headline": "Ready for Less-Tearful Future, Newtown Is Declining Tributes", "body": "\nNEWTOWN, Conn. \u2014 It was Newtown Day at Yankee Stadium on Sunday, the second time this year the Yankees have honored the town, and one among a nonstop blur of special events sponsored by sports teams, entertainers and corporations paying tribute to the victims and providing a diversion from  \n.         \n\nFour thousand residents saw the game at no cost, the Newtown Youth Voices sang the national anthem and members of the Newtown Police Department and the Sandy Hook Fire Department presented the flag.         \n\nStill, if the day was a success (though it was not for the Yankees, who lost 2-1), the event came just a few days after the town\u2019s first selectman, E. Patricia Llodra, sent a message that Newtown, for now, needs a breather. She said the town  \n for similar events in the interest of gingerly prodding residents toward a future less defined by the Dec. 14 shootings.         \n\n\u201cOver the past many months, we have been the recipients of great generosity and kindness of many individuals and organizations in donations of events and activities for Newtown families and children to enjoy in the wake of the December 14th tragedy,\u201d she wrote on her blog. \u201cI believe that the time is coming for us to move into a quiet period, of rest, recuperation and healing.\u201d         \n\nIn so doing, she put her finger on what almost everyone in town has been thinking about: Where is the line between respecting the magnitude of what happened last December and being engulfed by it? And when do events and observances become an unwelcome public reminder of private grief?         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been so much thrown our way, free tickets to a private James Taylor concert, Red Sox tickets, Yankees tickets,\u201d said Suzanne Schneider, who works at Newtown High School, which went on lockdown the day 20 children and 6 educators were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary.         \n\nOther events have featured the New York Giants, the New England Patriots, the Boston Bruins, major league soccer stars, children\u2019s book authors and monster trucks, to name just a few. Later this summer, the Nickelodeon boy band  \n will give a free concert in Newtown and Broadway veterans will direct, produce and choreograph a production of \u201cSeussical\u201d featuring local children. The professional tennis player  \n is giving a free tennis lesson to Newtown children on Wednesday. Those were planned before Ms. Llodra\u2019s message went out, and will go on.         \n\n\u201cEveryone appreciates what\u2019s been done,\u201d said Ms. Schneider, who also owns a local card and gift shop, called Down on Main Street. \u201cA lot of people want to do something and they\u2019re not sure what, but she\u2019s right in what she said.\u201d         \n\n \n, a musician whose 7-year-old son, Daniel, was one of the children killed in the shooting, said his family appreciated every kind word, gesture, home-cooked meal and word of encouragement.         \n\n\u201cOn a personal level, people have continued to show us such a tremendous outpouring of love and support, and we don\u2019t feel a need to move away from that,\u201d Mr.  \n said. \u201cBut when outside agencies want to come and build things, and set up walls and benches and events for us, we don\u2019t need to see constant reminders of what happened. It\u2019s permanently etched into our soul and psyche for the rest of our lives.\u201d         \n\nOn the surface, Newtown seems to have moved into summer\u2019s languid rhythms, from the mothers and children sitting at the picnic tables sharing cones at Holy Cow ice cream to the families taking in the $2 movies at the old Edmond Town Hall on Main Street.         \n\nMartin Blanco, a co-producer of what people sometimes describe as Newtown\u2019s version of \u201cA Prairie Home Companion,\u201d called the  \n, was proud of many things about the show on May 18, its first since the massacre. He loved Francine Wheeler\u2019s eloquent version of \u201cAfter All\u201d by Dar Williams, some comedy sketches and the campy, baton-twirling finale of the Beatles\u2019 \u201cEight Days a Week.\u201d         \n\nBut he was particularly pleased by what might seem like the most pallid of virtues. It felt, he said, normal.         \n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a healing show, it wasn\u2019t a special fund-raiser or a tribute,\u201d Mr. Blanco said. \u201cAll those are well and good, but it felt like a regular show, and I think when you add it all up, that was what people wanted to see.\u201d         \n\nBut around any corner, the reminders of Dec. 14 are everywhere.         \n\nAt the stately Cyrenius H. Booth Library, visitors are greeted by an exhibit called Books Heal Hearts, featuring children\u2019s books with titles like \u201cGoodbye Forever,\u201d \u201cIt Gets Better \u2014 A Book of Healing\u201d and \u201cI Miss You: A First Look at Death.\u201d         \n\nAt the Trinity Episcopal Church across the street is a huge banner for  \n, which is named for one of the children who were killed, and which is developing programs that will promote the long-term health of Newtown\u2019s young people and nurture a culture of nonviolence and caring.         \n\nMr. Barden said he could see the confusion in people\u2019s faces these days, unsure whether and how to directly address his loss.         \n\nAnd as much as it approached \u201cnormal,\u201d no one at the Flagpole Radio Caf\u00e9 show was unaware that Francine Wheeler, who sang, and David Wheeler, who took part in some of the comedy sketches, are the parents of Benjamin Wheeler, the \u201cBen\u201d of the Lighthouse Fund.         \n\nWhile she is discouraging celebrity programs, as well intentioned as they may be, Ms. Llodra said that locally generated remembrances would continue.         \n\nRick Haylon, a local entrepreneur, became active in the Lighthouse Fund, and now heads its effort to send children from Newtown to Oklahoma to help rebuild communities ravaged by the recent spring tornadoes.         \n\n\u201cIt would be easy for people to walk around downtown any given day and say everything is normal, but what happened is on everyone\u2019s mind every day,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no road map for what people are dealing with here, but we\u2019re all trying to do what\u2019s right.\u201d         \n\nMs. Llodra, who was at the game on Sunday, thanked the Yankees and said everyone in town needed things to take their mind off the tragedy. Still, she said, the town also needs to be mindful of those most affected by what occurred, and its own past and present as it moves forward.         \n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s hurtful to people who have experienced the magnitude of this harm to have this in their face all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are a town with 300 years of history. This is a piece of significant history to our town, and we need to learn to incorporate that into who we are but not have it be the only thing that defines who we are.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/10/nyregion/ready-for-less-tearful-future-newtown-is-declining-tributes.html", "date": "2013-07-09", "description": "Newtown, Conn., for a while at least, will stop accepting offers for special events paying tribute to the victims and providing a diversion from the catastrophe at Sandy Hook Elementary School."}
