{"headline": "California Sees Gridlock Ease in Governing", "body": "\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Before Washington, California was the national symbol of partisan paralysis and government dysfunction.         \n\nThis was the place where voter initiatives slashed the power of state lawmakers, runaway deficits and gridlocked budgets were the rule of the day, and a circus of a recall election forced a governor out of office 10 months into his second term.         \n\nBut in the past month, California has been the stage for a series of celebrations of unlikely legislative success \u2014 a parade of bill signings that offered a contrast between the shutdown in Washington and an acrimony-free California Legislature that enacted laws dealing with subjects including school financing, immigration, gun control and abortion.         \n\nThe turnaround from just 10 years ago \u2014 striking in tone, productivity and, at least on fiscal issues, moderation \u2014 is certainly a lesson in the power of one-party rule. Democrats hold an overwhelming majority in the Assembly and Senate and the governor, Jerry Brown, is a Democrat. The Republican Party, which just three years ago held the governor\u2019s seat and a feisty minority in both houses, has diminished to the point of near irrelevance.         \n\nBut the new atmosphere in Sacramento also offers the first evidence that three major changes in California\u2019s governance system intended to leach some of the partisanship out of politics \u2014 championed by reform advocates \u2014 may also be having their desired effect in a state that has long offered itself as the  \n.         \n\n\u201cYou see Republicans voting for immigration reform, you see Democrats voting for streamlining environmental regulations,\u201d said Dan Schnur, the director of the  \n. \u201cYou never would have seen that before.\u201d         \n\nLawmakers came into office this year representing districts whose lines were drawn by a nonpartisan commission, rather than under the more calculating eye of political leaders. This is the first Legislature chosen under an election system where the top two finishers in a nonpartisan primary run against each other, regardless of party affiliations, an effort to prod candidates to appeal to a wider ideological swath of the electorate.         \n\nAnd California voters approved last year an initiative to ease stringent term limits, which had produced a Statehouse filled with inexperienced legislators looking over the horizon to the next election. Lawmakers can now serve 12 years in either the Assembly or the Senate.         \n\nThe other day,  \n, a Republican state senator, joined Democrats as Mr. Brown signed a bill co-sponsored by Mr. Cannella  \n. Mr. Cannella said his district, which was 35 percent Republican when he was elected in 2010, will have considerably fewer Republican votes under district lines drawn by the independent commission for the next election.         \n\nUnlike Republicans in other parts of the country, Mr. Cannella is far from insulated from the demographic shifts in California, where growing Latino and Asian populations favor Democrats. Mr. Cannella, who described himself as a longtime supporter of the immigration bill, said the redistricting and nonpartisan election changes were freeing lawmakers from obedience to their party bases.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s given more courage to my Republican colleagues,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were afraid of getting primaries. Now, it\u2019s not just their base they have to appeal to.\u201d         \n\n \n a former senior adviser to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican who championed the ballot changes, said they were altering the nature of the Legislature but also his own party.         \n\n\u201cIt gives Republicans the chance to break from their caucus on certain issues,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is very different than it was four or five years ago.\u201d         \n\nDemocrats may also be changing. The state Chamber of Commerce reported last month that 39 of the 40 bills it had described as \u201cjob-killing\u201d \u2014 regulatory legislation that typically was supported by Democrats \u2014 had been defeated this year.         \n\n\u201cIn the freshman class, a lot of the folks had moderate voting records,\u201d said  \n, a Democrat who was elected to the State Assembly last year, evidence of the need for many legislators to appeal beyond the Democratic base.         \n\nBut Mr. Rendon, who is also a political scientist, said that of the three changes, term limits were having the most immediate effect. Mr. Rendon said he had held back a child care bill that would have permitted unions to represent home-based child care workers this year, so he could draft a bill that would draw a broader coalition of support next year.         \n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to solve all the state\u2019s problems in the first year out,\u201d he said.
