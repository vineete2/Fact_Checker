{"headline": "Italian Prime Minister Calls Populism a Threat to Stability in Europe", "body": "\nROME \u2014 With European parliamentary elections less than eight months away, Prime Minister Enrico Letta of Italy on Monday warned that the rise of angry populism poses the greatest threat to stability on the Continent and could undermine critical efforts to build and strengthen the euro zone\u2019s political and financial institutions.         \n\n\u201cWe have the big risk to have the most \u2018anti-European\u2019 European Parliament ever,\u201d Mr. Letta said in an expansive interview at Palazzo Chigi, his office in central Rome. He said mainstream, pro-Europe parties must win at least 70 percent of the seats to avoid a \u201cnightmarish legislature.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThe rise of populism is today the main European social and political issue,\u201d Mr. Letta added. \u201cTo fight against populism, in my view, is a mission today \u2014 in Italy and in the other countries.\u201d         \n\nMr. Letta, 47, who became prime minister in April, is scheduled to meet with President Obama in Washington on Thursday to discuss free-trade efforts, instability in Libya and immigration issues in the Mediterranean area. During the interview on Monday, Mr. Letta said Italy would soon announce details of a new government plan to expand air and sea patrols in the Strait of Sicily, following two accidents in which hundreds of migrants died after smugglers\u2019 boats capsized while trying to reach the Italian island of Lampedusa.         \n\n\u201cItaly will work without waiting for European decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that, at the European level, it is impossible to have on these issues timely decisions. But people are dying today, not waiting for bureaucratic achievement in six or nine months.\u201d         \n\nIn recent weeks, Mr. Letta has emerged as a newly empowered figure in Italian and European politics, after he fended off an attempt by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to bring down the coalition government, winning a resounding confidence vote for his government on Oct. 2.         \n\nOn Monday, Mr. Letta returned to the same argument he made to save his government: that Italy must avoid political instability so that Parliament can pass important political overhauls but also because lending rates on Italian debt rise with every political crisis. He said lower interest rates could free up 15 billion euros, or $20.4 billion, from debt payments to fulfill promises on tax cuts for labor costs.         \n\n\u201cPolitical stability is decisive,\u201d said Mr. Letta, who conducted the interview in English. \u201cSomebody has criticized me, saying it\u2019s just words. It\u2019s not words \u2014 it\u2019s money.\u201d         \n\nMr. Letta said Italy\u2019s recent political upheaval had hardly happened in a vacuum: He described the current political standoff in the United States, as well as various political confrontations in Europe, as part of a broader, interconnected moment in which governance is failing in some democracies \u2014 and alienating voters in the process, driving populist movements of all stripes. Declining to comment specifically about continuing negotiations in Washington, Mr. Letta said that the world needed America.         \n\n\u201cWe need the American leadership,\u201d he said. \u201cLast year, American leadership helped the Europeans to overcome the economic problems of the austerity and the euro crisis. We need the American leadership on growth, on the fight against protectionism. This is why we hope for a solution, of course, of the internal problems, because we need this leadership.\u201d         \n\nItaly\u2019s political landscape has been turbulent for more than a year, with more than eight million voters supporting the new, populist Five Star Movement, led by a former comedian, Beppe Grillo, in the last national elections. Mr. Letta, who once served as an elected member of the European Parliament, said parliamentary elections in May would serve as Europe\u2019s biggest test on whether the momentum toward greater integration and euro zone institution building could be impeded.         \n\n\u201cThe big risk is to have a European Parliament with 25 percent of Parliament coming from anti-euro or Europe movements,\u201d he said, noting that populist movements in different countries arose from different places on the political spectrum. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to say left or right. Some of them are racists. Some of them are not racists,\u201d he added. \u201cBut they are all anti-euro and all anti-Europe.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/15/world/europe/italian-prime-minister-calls-populism-a-threat-to-stability-in-europe.html", "date": "2013-10-15", "description": "In an interview, Prime Minister Enrico Letta said the rise of angry populism could undermine efforts to build and strengthen the euro zone\u2019s political and financial institutions."}
