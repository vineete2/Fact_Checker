{"headline": "How to Set a Price on the Life of a Beloved Pet?", "body": "\nI COULDN\u2019T begin to add up the number of times my husband and I have had the Talk. We know illness and death are two of life\u2019s certainties. And we\u2019ve taken care of the issue when it comes to ourselves. We\u2019ve signed medical directives saying we want no extraordinary measures taken to extend our lives if we become incapacitated to the point that we\u2019re a burden, emotionally and financially, to our families.         \n\nBut when it comes to our pets, the Talk never resolves anything.         \n\nLuckily our two 14-year-old cats, 8-year-old Border collie and 3-year-old Labrador retriever are all in fairly good health. We haven\u2019t had to make decisions about whether to spend thousands of dollars, possibly tens of thousands, to save or extend their lives. But those decisions are coming, and despite our efforts to have the Talk, we have no idea what we\u2019ll be willing to do to keep them around as long as possible.         \n\nThat so many more technological advances are available now than there were 10 years ago means pet owners have more ethical and financial choices to make. \u201cIn the last 30 years there\u2019s been an increase in specialty veterinary medicine,\u201d said our veterinarian, Dr. Woody Walker of La Ca\u00f1ada Pet Clinic, north of Los Angeles. \u201cAnd the technology is amazing. Whatever we can do in people, we can do in pets.\u201d         \n\nPet owners, who represent 68 percent of United States households, spent a collective $53 billion on pets last year, according to the American Pet Products Association. That\u2019s for everything from medicines and operations to toys and food.         \n\nNo one has a figure for how much people spend on end-of-life care for their pets. But it\u2019s safe to assume that the number mirrors ours; for humans, 90 percent of medical spending occurs in the last 10 percent of life. The choices involved in keeping pets alive can be as numerous, expensive and emotionally thorny as they are with people.         \n\nLisa Sobieri of Greenwich, Conn., knows the choices all too well. The 49-year-old married mother of two lost two dogs to kidney disease in the last three years. The first, Kiefer, an American Eskimo, died just before turning 15, only after the family had spent several thousand dollars on chemotherapy for bladder cancer and then other drugs to keep him comfortable as his kidneys failed.         \n\n\u201cI guess when you go into it you don\u2019t really know how much you\u2019re going to spend,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it keeps kind of adding up, and you don\u2019t really know. We were thinking, O.K., there is a limit, but when it\u2019s $500 here or $1,000 there, you don\u2019t really see it adding up that fast.\u201d         \n\nAfter Kiefer died, the family got Perry, a 6-month-old golden retriever. When Ms. Sobieri took the dog to the vet to have him neutered, a routine blood test showed Perry had a genetic kidney disease. \u201cI actually didn\u2019t believe them,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI said, \u2018No, you\u2019re looking at my other dog\u2019s file by mistake.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Unfortunately, they weren\u2019t. The vet sent Ms. Sobieri to a veterinary oncologist who said Perry probably would not live more than three years.         \n\n\u201cI was thinking, Well, we\u2019re such great dog owners that we\u2019re going to defy that, give him all the medications and diet, experimental treatments, and he\u2019s going to live longer,\u201d Ms. Sobieri said. The family decided against a kidney transplant, which would have cost a minimum of $25,000 just for the operation, an amount she said would have taken money away from the children\u2019s college fund. There was also no guarantee it would work. But they still spent, by Ms. Sobieri\u2019s estimates, tens of thousands of dollars to keep Perry comfortable for the duration of his life, with pet  \n picking up the rest.         \n\nMany pet owners struggle with whether to buy pet insurance, because it has a mixed track record. Consumer Reports, in its August 2011 issue, said the insurance was \u201crarely worth the price.\u201d Pre-existing conditions are usually excluded from coverage; routine care, like annual checkups, is sometimes not included in plans; and premiums can rise significantly as the pet ages.         \n\nThe Sobieris, though, said their insurance, provided by Embrace, was invaluable and made their decision-making just a little easier. Still, Ms. Sobieri said, \u201cWe did some pretty good damage on the credit card toward the end.\u201d         \n\nThe puppy lived only an additional 18 months. And Ms. Sobieri said she now wondered if the money would have been better spent as a contribution to research to find a cure for the disease, even though they cherished the extra year and a half they had with Perry.
