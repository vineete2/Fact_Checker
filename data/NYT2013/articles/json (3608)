And this is the cake I have been making over the last several years to celebrate. It\u2019s a rich almond birthday cake frosted with buttercream.         \n\nWhen I originally made this cake \n, I flavored the icing with lemon, sherry and a little bit of cinnamon. Since then, I\u2019ve played with the flavorings. Vanilla extract (or seeds from a scraped-out bean) is classic; freshly grated ginger root gives it spice and exuberance; a touch of rye or bourbon, a splash of vermouth and a dash of bitters make it taste like a creamy manhattan.         \n\nFeel free to vary the flavors and make this basic buttercream your own. The video will give you the basics on how to make it, and you can find the recipe for both the cake and icing here:         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/06/dining/a-party-is-icing-on-the-cake.html", "date": "2013-11-05", "description": "A visual guide to making almond birthday cake with sherry-lemon buttercream."}
