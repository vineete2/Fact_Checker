{"headline": "Boehner Pledges to Avoid Default, Republicans Say", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Speaker John A. Boehner has privately told Republican lawmakers anxious about fallout from the government shutdown that he would not allow a potentially more crippling federal default as the atmosphere on Capitol Hill turned increasingly tense on Thursday.         \n\nMr. Boehner\u2019s comments, recounted by multiple lawmakers, that he would use a combination of Republican and Democratic votes to increase the federal debt limit if necessary appeared aimed at reassuring his colleagues \u2014 and nervous financial markets \u2014 that he did not intend to let the economic crisis spiral further out of control.         \n\nThey came even though he has so far refused to allow a vote on a Senate budget measure to end the shutdown that many believe could pass with bipartisan backing. They also reflect Mr. Boehner\u2019s view that a default would have widespread and long-term economic consequences while the shutdown, though disruptive, had more limited impact.         \n\nWith the mood in Congress already unsettled by the bitter sparring over the fiscal standoff, the Capitol was shaken anew Thursday afternoon when a high-speed chase beginning near the White House ended near the Senate office complex with Capitol Police shooting the driver to death.         \n\nThe sound of gunfire outside the Capitol forced at least five senators in the vicinity to take cover on their stomachs and led to a temporary lockdown of members of Congress and their staffs. The House and Senate adjourned for the day shortly after the incident as the shutdown extended into a third day.         \n\nAlong with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate Republican leader, Mr. Boehner has long dismissed the idea that Congress would not act to prevent a damaging default, and President Obama on Thursday called a default \u201cthe height of irresponsibility.\u201d But the failure of the House and Senate to reach a deal ahead of the shutdown has raised questions of whether Republicans could be persuaded to join in raising the debt limit before the Treasury Department runs out of money about the middle of October.         \n\nHis comments were read by members of both parties as renewing his determination on the default and came as the Treasury warned that an impasse over raising the debt limit might prove catastrophic and potentially result \u201cin a financial crisis and recession that could echo the events of 2008 or worse.\u201d         \n\nLawmakers said that in recent days, Mr. Boehner, who is under fierce attack from Democrats over his handling of the shutdown, has made clear that he is willing to use a combination of Republican and Democratic votes on the debt limit if need be. Representative Leonard Lance of New Jersey, one of the moderate Republicans who met privately with Mr. Boehner on Wednesday, would not provide details of the meeting, but said, \u201cThe speaker of the House does not want to default on the debt on the United States, and I believe he believes in Congress as an institution, and I certainly believe he is working for the best interests of the American people.\u201d         \n\nOne lawmaker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Mr. Boehner suggested he would be willing to violate the so-called Hastert Rule to pass a debt-limit increase. The informal rule refers to a policy of not bringing to the floor any measure that does not have a majority of Republican votes.         \n\nA spokesman for Mr. Boehner pushed back on the idea that the speaker would try to pass a debt-limit increase mainly with Democratic votes. \u201cThe speaker always, always prefers to pass legislation with a strong Republican majority,\u201d said Michael Steel, a spokesman for Mr. Boehner.         \n\nBut Mr. Steel acknowledged that Mr. Boehner, who has long and deep ties to the business community, understood the need to head off a default.         \n\n\u201cThe speaker has always been clear that a default would be disastrous for our economy,\u201d Mr. Steel said. \u201cHe\u2019s also been clear that a \u2018clean\u2019 debt hike cannot pass the House. That\u2019s why the president and Senate Democrats should drop their \u2018no negotiations\u2019 stance, and work with us on a plan to raise the debt limit in a responsible way, with spending cuts and reforms to get our economy moving again and create jobs.\u201d         \n\nIt is conceivable that Mr. Boehner could pass a debt-limit increase with a slim majority of Republican votes, with Democrats making up the difference, as he has in the past on budget measures. But moving in that direction poses risks of a threat to Mr. Boehner\u2019s leadership position from a watchful conservative bloc, which has warned that his post could be on the line if he goes against the legislative position of large numbers of the rank and file.         \n\nRepresentative John C. Fleming, Republican of Louisiana and one of his conference\u2019s more conservative members, said that he doubted Mr. Boehner would be able to pass any bill \u2014 with or without Democratic support \u2014 that did not extract some significant concessions from Mr. Obama and Senate Democrats.         \n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t think there\u2019d be hardly any Republicans in support of raising the debt ceiling without cuts to spending, changes to Obamacare, and perhaps other issues,\u201d Mr. Fleming said. He added that he thought House Republicans would demand at least some sort of delay to the president\u2019s signature health care law, as well as require that every dollar increase in the debt ceiling be matched by a dollar increase in spending cuts.         \n\nAt the same time, growing numbers of House Republicans have expressed frustration at those insisting on changes to the health law when Mr. Obama has made clear he will not accept them. Their unhappiness, the furor caused by the shutdown and the desire to avoid default could help protect Mr. Boehner.         \n\nRepresentative James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma and chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, said he did not think House Republicans had the \u201cenergy\u201d to deal with a debt default.         \n\n\u201cThe speaker\u2019s been over and over on that on the debt ceiling, that there\u2019s no intention for default,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s been public, private, everywhere he\u2019s had an opportunity.\u201d         \n\nDemocrats saw the disclosure of Mr. Boehner\u2019s private comments as a possible sign of progress.         \n\n\u201cEven coming close to the edge of default is very dangerous, and putting this issue to rest significantly ahead of the default date would allow everyone in the country to breathe a huge sigh of relief,\u201d said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Democrat in the Senate.         \n\nA Treasury Department report released Thursday said the debt-limit impasse could cause credit markets to freeze, the dollar to plummet and interest rates to rise precipitously.         \n\nAfter its release, Mr. Obama reiterated administration warnings about the potential economic consequences of not increasing the debt limit. \u201cAs reckless as a government shutdown is, as many people as are being hurt by a government shutdown, an economic shutdown that results from default would be dramatically worse,\u201d Mr. Obama said Thursday, speaking to construction workers at M. Luis Construction in Rockville, Md., a suburb north of Washington.         \n\nW. James McNerney Jr., chief executive of Boeing, and also the chairman of the Business Roundtable, a corporate association, and of the White House export council, said in an interview on Thursday that for corporate America, the standoff over the government shutdown \u201cdrives an even deeper concern about the debt limit.\u201d         \n\n\"Moderate voices\u00a0in\u00a0the business community\u00a0and elsewhere\u00a0do not seem to be making much of\u00a0an impact \u2014 encouraging the kind of cooperation among our political leaders that we need to\u00a0solve this problem. It\u2019s frustrating,\u201d he said.         \n\nRepresentative Michael G. Fitzpatrick, Republican of Pennsylvania, one of just 22 House Republicans this year who helped Mr. Boehner pass, with a majority of Democratic support, three crucial bills \u2014 to avert a fiscal showdown, to provide relief for the victims of Hurricane Sandy, and to pass the Violence Against Women Act \u2014 said he expected he may be asked to do so again.         \n\n\u201cHurricane Sandy, the fiscal cliff, all of the big votes require reasonable Republicans and Democrats to come together in order to pass it and get it to the president\u2019s desk,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will be no different.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/04/us/politics/debt-limit-impasse.html", "date": "2013-10-03", "description": "Speaker John A.
