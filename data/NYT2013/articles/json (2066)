{"headline": "For Those in Their 20s, a Finding That They Don\u2019t Manage Debt Well", "body": "\nYou\u2019re a young adult, starting to build your career. You\u2019re trying to juggle  \n payments, pay your rent and cover other bills, so it\u2019s tempting to make an occasional late payment on your credit card. No big deal, right?         \n\nThink again. Late payments can damage your credit score, which can make it harder for you to get a loan \u2014 or even a new apartment \u2014 when you need one.         \n\nYoung adults have been cutting back on most forms of debt, other than student loans. But an analysis by Experian, one of the three major credit-reporting agencies, suggests that the millennial generation \u2014 those now in their 20s \u2014 could do a better job at managing the debt they have.         \n\nMillennials have the fewest number of credit cards and the lowest average balance on them, according to Experian\u2019s annual  \n. Yet, they also have the lowest  \n, and a relatively high incidence of late payments.         \n\nThe report is based on an analysis of more than 10 million credit files and uses Vantage scores, a competitor to the oft-cited FICO scores that form a large part of the credit report that lenders use to gauge an person\u2019s credit risk. FICO is an acronym for the Fair Issac Corporation, which invented the scores.         \n\nThe Vantage score is a three-digit number from 300 to 850 that lenders use to rank your creditworthiness; the higher your score, the better. (FICO scores also run from 300 to 850).         \n\nNationally, Experian found, the average debt in the United States is roughly $28,000, including credit cards, car loans, student loans and other personal loans. The average number of credit cards is more than two, and the average balance on the cards is about $4,500.         \n\nMillennials have low overall debt (about $23,000 per person on average, comparable to what the oldest Americans have), and the lowest average card debt ($2,700). Generation X, roughly those in their early 30s to age 46, has the highest average debt of the four generations analyzed, at $30,000. But while the average credit score in Experian\u2019s analysis is 681, the average for millennials is just 628.         \n\nIn part, that is because the younger generation has high utilization of their credit \u2014 they tend to have lower credit limits, so it does not take long to max out their cards. \u201cIt looks like they\u2019re using a lot of credit, compared to what\u2019s available to them,\u201d said Rod Griffin, director of public education for Experian.         \n\nYounger adults also tend to have shorter credit histories, just because of their age, said Mr. Griffin; the length of time you\u2019ve had an account factors into your credit score. It\u2019s now more difficult now to obtain a credit card in your own name if you are under 21, because of the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act, or Credit CARD Act, of 2009. That law was aimed, in part, at keeping young people, particularly college students, from overspending with credit cards. A parent, however, can cosign, or add a child to their account as an authorized user.         \n\nA challenging economy and persistently higher unemployment for younger adults also makes it harder for them to stretch their income and could force them to use credit in an emergency. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a lot of savings or financial flexibility,\u201d said Joe Valenti, director of asset building at the Center for American Progress, an independent nonprofit research organization.         \n\nThat rings true for Michelle Wood, a legal assistant in Marion, Ohio, who attends school at night. Ms. Wood, who turned 30 this year, said she had no emergency savings. She had a low credit score \u2014 in the 500\u2019s \u2014 three years ago, but has been able to increase it into the high 600\u2019s by using a secured credit card, which has a low limit, for smaller purchases, and then paying it off immediately. \u201cI don\u2019t have any other debt, other than my student loans,\u201d she said. Still, she worries that she won\u2019t be able to make her minimum loan payments when she completes her bachelor\u2019s degree in social work. She decided she needed a four-year degree to get a better job, but she has accumulated about $40,000 in education debt.         \n\nHere are some questions about credit scores and debt:         \n\n \n         \n\n \nFactors considered generally include the number and age of your accounts, your balances, payment history and your use of revolving credit (credit cards) relative to your credit limit.         \n\n \n\u2009 \n         \n\nPay your bills on time, even if you\u2019re just making the minimum payment on a credit card, says the credit expert John Ulzheimer; your payment history plays a big part in your credit score. Also avoid maxing out your cards, which can lower your score.         \n\n \n\u2009 \n         \n\nYou are entitled to request a free copy of your credit report each year at  \n.
