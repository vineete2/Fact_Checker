{"headline": "Operation: Mother\u2019s Day", "body": "\nAttention, significant others of mothers: Breakfast in bed is a thoughtful, time-honored gesture for Mother\u2019s Day. There is, however, an alternative to a precariously balanced tray of eggs, orange juice and coffee, all of which she eats by herself while the kids hang around watching. That alternative is a simple but wonderful dinner, cooked by you and those same adorable children, eaten together at an actual table.         \n\nHere\u2019s a three-course meal, easy enough for novice cooks to pull off and impressive enough so that those who know how to cook will be pleased. It features a  \n that may become a lifelong standard and a can\u2019t-fail version of Jean-Georges Vongerichten\u2019s  \n.         \n\nI\u2019ve also included a comprehensive battle plan \u2014 a timeline for everything you\u2019ll need to do in the kitchen with suggestions for the tasks to delegate to your kids. (If they\u2019re the better cooks, they can delegate to you.) Just remember: Even though you cooked, you still have to do the dishes.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \nPut the beets in the oven. Make the salad dressing. (Have the kids measure out the ingredients and shake the jar.)         \n\nMake the cake batter and put it into the molds. (Kids can beat the batter and butter and flour the molds.)         \n\n \n         \n\nCook the chicken. When it\u2019s done, turn off the heat and cover it with a lid; reheat gently before serving.         \n\nAs the chicken cooks, rinse and dry the salad greens; cover them with a paper towel and put them in the fridge. Toast the walnuts.         \n\n \n         \n\nSlice the beets; store them in a container or wrap in plastic. (Have the kids peel the beets; they\u2019ll love their hands turning pink.) Set the table, put the flowers in a vase, drink some wine.         \n\n \n         \n\n\u200bPut the skillet with the chicken (covered) over medium-low heat.         \n\nDress the greens and beets, and assemble the salads.         \n\nHeat the oven to 450 and take the cake batter out of the fridge to come to room temperature.         \n\n \n\u200b         \n\nDinner is served.         \n\n \n         \n\nPut the cakes in the oven (don\u2019t forget to set a timer), then you clear the table (or have the kids do it) as the cakes cook.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n\u200bWhen the cakes are done, unmold them, and serve.         \n\n \n         \n\nAnother glass of wine for Mom.
