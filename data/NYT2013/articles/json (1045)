{"headline": "Glaxo Says It Will Stop Paying Doctors to Promote Drugs", "body": "\nThe British drug maker GlaxoSmithKline will no longer pay doctors to promote its products and will stop tying compensation of sales representatives to the number of prescriptions doctors write, its chief executive said Monday, effectively ending two common industry practices that critics have long assailed as troublesome conflicts of interest.         \n\nThe announcement appears to be a first for a major drug company \u2014 although others may be considering similar moves \u2014 and it comes at a particularly sensitive time for Glaxo. It is the subject of a bribery investigation in China, where authorities contend the company funneled illegal payments to doctors and government officials in an effort to lift drug sales.         \n\nAndrew Witty, Glaxo\u2019s chief executive, said in a telephone interview Monday that its proposed changes were unrelated to the investigation in China, and were part of a yearslong effort \u201cto try and make sure we stay in step with how the world is changing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe keep asking ourselves, are there different ways, more effective ways of operating than perhaps the ways we as an industry have been operating over the last 30, 40 years?\u201d         \n\nFor decades, pharmaceutical companies have paid doctors to speak on their behalf at conferences and other meetings of medical professionals, on the assumption that the doctors are most likely to value the advice of trusted peers.         \n\nBut the practice has also been criticized by those who question whether it unduly influences the information doctors give each other and can lead them to prescribe drugs inappropriately to patients. All such payments by pharmaceutical companies are to be made public next year under requirements of the Obama administration\u2019s health care law.         \n\nUnder the plan, which Glaxo said would be completed worldwide by 2016, the company will no longer pay health care professionals to speak on its behalf about its products or the diseases they treat \u201cto audiences who can prescribe or influence prescribing,\u201d it said in a statement. It will also stop providing financial support directly to doctors to attend medical conferences, a practice that is prohibited in the United States through an industry-imposed ethics code but that still occurs in other countries. In China, the authorities have said Glaxo compensated doctors for travel to conferences and lectures that never took place.         \n\nMr. Witty declined to comment on the investigation because he said it was still underway.         \n\nGlaxo will continue to pay doctors consulting fees for market research because Mr. Witty said it was necessary for the company to gain insight from doctors about their products, but he said that activity would be limited in scope. A Glaxo spokesman said that each year the company spends \u201ctens of millions\u201d of dollars globally on the practices that it was ending, but declined to be more specific.         \n\nGlaxo is among the largest drug companies in the world, reporting global third-quarter sales of 6.51 billion pounds, or $10.1 billion, a 1 percent rise from the same period a year ago. Sales fell markedly in China as the investigation proceeded.         \n\nThe move won qualified praise from Dr. Jerry Avorn, a professor at Harvard Medical School who has written critically about the industry\u2019s marketing practices.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a modest acknowledgment of the fact that learning from a doctor who is paid by a drug company to give a talk about its products isn\u2019t the best way for doctors to learn about those products,\u201d Dr. Avorn said. But he noted that Glaxo would continue to provide what the company described in a statement as \u201cunsolicited, independent educational grants\u201d to continue educating doctors about their products.         \n\nHe said that in the past the grants had often been provided to for-profit companies that rely on such payments from drug companies, raising questions about whether they were providing truly independent information.
