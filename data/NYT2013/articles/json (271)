{"headline": "Banks Seen as Aid in\nFraud Against Older\nConsumers", "body": "\nThe pitch arrived, as so many do, with a friendly cold call.         \n\nBruno Koch, 83, told the telemarketer on the line that, yes, of course he would like to update his health insurance card. Then Mr. Koch, of Newport News, Va., slipped up: he divulged his bank account information.         \n\nWhat happened next is all too familiar. Money was withdrawn from Mr. Koch\u2019s account for something that he now says he never authorized. The new health insurance card never arrived.         \n\nWhat is less familiar \u2014 and what federal authorities say occurs with alarming frequency \u2014 is that a reputable bank played a crucial role in parting Mr. Koch from his money. The bank was the 140-year-old Zions Bank of Salt Lake City. Despite spotting suspicious activity, Zions served as a gateway between dubious Internet merchants and their marks \u2014 and made money for itself in the process, according to newly unsealed court documents reviewed by The New York Times.         \n\nThe Times reviewed hundreds of filings in connection with civil lawsuits brought by federal authorities and a consumer law firm against Zions and another regional bank that has drawn even more scrutiny,  \n. Last November, First Delaware reached a $15 million settlement with the Justice Department after the bank was accused of allowing merchants to illegally debit accounts more than two million times and siphon more than $100 million.         \n\nThe documents, as well as interviews with state and federal officials, paint a troubling picture. They outline how banks profit handsomely by collecting fees while ignoring warnings of potential fraud and, in some instances, enabling dubious merchants to prey on consumers.         \n\nAnyone, young or old, can be targeted by unscrupulous marketers. But for several reasons \u2014 financial worries, age, loneliness \u2014 older people are particularly vulnerable to what is known as mass market fraud, deceptive pitches that arrive by telephone, mail and the Internet.         \n\nThe problems at Zions and First Delaware, where the banks became financial conduits and quiet enablers for questionable businesses, extend well beyond those two institutions, federal authorities say. Indeed, banks across the country, from some of the largest to smaller regional players, help facilitate billions of dollars of fraud each year, according to interviews with consumer lawyers and state and federal prosecutors.         \n\nOfficials at the Justice Department say they are taking aim at banks\u2019 role in giving predatory lenders and fraudulent merchants access to the United States financial system. The department is considering civil and criminal actions against a number of banks for allowing tainted money to flow through branches, for failing to safeguard against suspicious merchants, and for originating transactions on behalf of businesses that they know make unauthorized withdrawals from customer accounts, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.         \n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t close your eyes anymore to the fraud that you are allowing to happen,\u201d said Michael Blume, the director of the consumer protection branch at the Justice Department. \u201cBanks are in business to make a profit. Unfortunately, this is a moneymaking operation at consumers\u2019 expense.\u201d         \n\nZions did not interact directly with the company that called Mr. Koch, National Health Net Online. What the bank did was establish a banking relationship with an intermediary, Modern Payments, that handled payments for National Health. Mr. Koch\u2019s account at a small Virginia bank was debited by National Health, which in turn paid Modern Payments for processing the transaction. Modern Payments gave its bank, Zions, a cut of its fee.         \n\nIn all, Zions in effect let roughly $39 million be withdrawn from hundreds of thousands of accounts from 2007 to 2009. Much of that money was ultimately transferred to bank accounts in Canada, India and the Caribbean, according to a Times review of court records. Many of the Internet merchants\u2019 customers were older people and others on shaky financial footing. But that, too, worked in banks\u2019 favor: the withdrawals set off a cascade of insufficient fund fees \u2014 more than $20 million in all, court records show.
