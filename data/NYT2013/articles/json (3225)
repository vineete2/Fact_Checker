{"headline": "\u201860 Minutes\u2019 Airs Apology on Benghazi", "body": "\n \n was scheduled to deliver a report on Sunday\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d about disabled veterans who climb mountains. Instead, she appeared in front of the newsmagazine\u2019s trademark black backdrop and issued an apology.         \n\nMs. Logan said that Dylan Davies, one of the main sources for a two-week-old piece about the attack on the American diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, had misled the program\u2019s staff when he gave an account of rushing to the compound the night the attack took place. \u201cIt was a mistake to include him in our report. For that, we are very sorry,\u201d Ms. Logan said.         \n\nThe apology lasted only 90 seconds and revealed nothing new about why  \n had trusted Mr. Davies, who appeared on the program under the pseudonym Morgan Jones. Off-camera, CBS executives were left to wonder how viewers would react to the exceptionally rare correction.         \n\nWhile veteran television journalists spent the weekend debating whether the now-discredited Benghazi report would cause long-term damage to the esteemed newsmagazine\u2019s brand, some media critics joined the liberal advocacy group Media Matters for America in calling for CBS to initiate an independent investigation of missteps in the reporting process.         \n\nBut the CBS News chairman, Jeff Fager, who is also the executive producer of \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d has not ordered an investigation, and on Sunday a spokesman indicated that the program was going to let its televised apology be its last word on the issue.         \n\nHowever, the apology was  \n on Sunday night. Craig Silverman, of the correction blog Regret the Error, predicted that it would not \u201ctake the heat off CBS News.\u201d         \n\n\u201cAside from the fact that it struck a very passive tone and pushed the responsibility onto the source, Dylan Davies, it said nothing about how the show failed to properly vet the story of an admitted liar,\u201d Mr. Silverman said in an email. \u201cThere are basic questions left unanswered about how the program checked out what Davies told them, and where this process failed.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIn the short term, this will confirm the worst suspicions of people who don\u2019t trust CBS News,\u201d said Paul Friedman, CBS\u2019s executive vice president for news until 2011. \u201cIn the long term, a lot will depend on how tough and transparent CBS can be in finding out how this happened \u2014 especially when there were not the kind of tight deadline pressures that sometimes result in errors.\u201d         \n\nMs. Logan has said that a year of reporting informed the Oct. 27 piece, which was Mr. Davies\u2019s first interview. Some of Ms. Logan\u2019s conclusions still hold up to scrutiny \u2014 for example, that \u201ccontrary to the White House\u2019s public statements, which were still being made a full week later, it\u2019s now well established that the Americans were attacked by Al Qaeda in a well-planned assault.\u201d         \n\nBut enough doubts have been sown about Mr. Davies\u2019 account of being an eyewitness that CBS apologized on Friday, scrubbed the report from its site (and the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d Twitter feed) and prepared Ms. Logan\u2019s on-camera statement Sunday. (Mr. Davies\u2019s account included him hitting an Al Qaeda fighter in the face with the butt of a rifle and seeing the dead ambassador, J. Christopher Stevens, at a hospital.)         \n\nParallels have been drawn between this case and CBS\u2019s  \n on President George W. Bush\u2019s time in the National Guard. Each time, the news division adopted a defensive crouch when advocates first started to question the stories. But the political backdrop has changed significantly this time. In 2004, there were accusations of \u201cliberal bias\u201d and unrelenting coverage of the controversy on conservative websites, driven by the right\u2019s long animus toward Dan Rather, the correspondent on the Bush report, and the implication that he was trying to hurt the president\u2019s re-election chances.         \n\nThis time, conservatives initially trumpeted the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d report: the morning after it was broadcast, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said on Fox News that he planned to block all administration nominations until Congress was granted access to all of the survivors of the attack. (On Sunday, Mr. Graham stood by his threat despite CBS\u2019s retraction.) At the same time, questions about Mr. Davies and his account were immediately raised, by both liberal activists and independent reporters.
