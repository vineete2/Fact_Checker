{"headline": "With Cooked Tomatoes, Stick With Cool Reds or Ros\u00e9", "body": "\nRaw tomatoes, high in acid, demand high-acid wines. But cooked-tomato dishes like this crostata are altogether mellower, and so welcome a wider range of wines. A high-acid wine like an unoaked barbera from Asti or Alba would still go beautifully, but so would a Sicilian nerello mascalese from Mount Etna or a good Proven\u00e7al ros\u00e9. Serve the reds cool. White wines would work well, too, like a falanghina or fiano di Avellino from Campania, or a good sauvignon blanc on the herbal side. Personally, because I imagine the flavors of this crostata as broad rather than sharp, I would probably stick with reds or ros\u00e9. Other red options include Beaujolais, lighter pinot noirs like those from Sancerre or the range of light reds from northern Italy, like teroldego, lagrein, grignolino and those from the Valle d\u2019Aosta.\u00a0        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/07/dining/with-cooked-tomatoes-stick-with-cool-reds-or-rose.html", "date": "2013-08-06", "description": "A wide range of wines can work to complement a mellow tomato crostata, though cool reds fare best."}
