{"headline": "House Rejects Farm Bill as Food Stamp Cuts Prove Divisive", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The surprise defeat of the farm bill in the House on Thursday underscored the ideological divide between the more conservative, antispending Republican lawmakers and their leadership, who failed to garner sufficient votes from their caucus as well as from Democrats.         \n\nThe vote against the bill, 234 to 195, comes a year after House leaders pulled the measure off the calendar because conservative lawmakers demanded deeper cuts in the food stamp program and Democrats objected. This year\u2019s measure called for more significant cuts than the Senate bill, but it still did not go far enough to get a majority in the House to support an overhaul of the nation\u2019s food and farm programs. Sixty-two Republicans, or more than a quarter of the caucus, voted with Democrats to defeat the bill.         \n\nThe failure was a stinging defeat for Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio, who continues to have trouble marshaling the Republican support he needs to pass major legislation. Without the solid backing of his party, Mr. Boehner has to rely on some Democratic support, which deserted him Thursday.         \n\nMr. Boehner was unable to secure the votes of a number of recently elected and strongly conservative lawmakers who were averse to cutting deals on legislation like the farm bill. Traditionally, the farm bill has passed easily with support from urban lawmakers concerned with nutrition spending and rural members focused on farm programs. But conservatives said they were more driven by a desire to shrink the size of government through spending cuts, not expand it though crop insurance subsides to rich farmers.         \n\n\u201cWhile it might have been called a \u2018farm bill,\u2019 the American people understand that it was anything but,\u201d said Representative Marlin Stutzman, Republican of Indiana, who was elected in 2010 with Tea Party support. \u201cThis trillion-dollar spending bill is too big and would have passed welfare policy on the backs of farmers.\u201d         \n\nAfter the vote, Republicans and Democrats took turns on the floor blaming each other for the bill\u2019s failure.         \n\n\u201cYou took a bipartisan bill and turned it into a partisan bill,\u201d said Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the House\u2019s No. 2 Democrat. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate for farmers, for consumers and our country.\u201d         \n\nRepresentative Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia, the House majority leader, said Democrats had \u201cundone years and years of bipartisan work and made it partisan.\u201d         \n\nIt was unclear if House leaders would try to revive the bill, even as Senate leaders chided the House for failing to pass it.         \n\n\u201cTwice the Senate has overwhelmingly passed a bipartisan farm bill that reforms farm programs, ends direct payments, cuts spending and creates American agriculture jobs,\u201d said Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan and the chairwoman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. \u201cThe House needs to find a way to get a five-year farm bill done.\u201d         \n\nThe House bill would have cut projected spending in farm and nutrition programs by nearly $40 billion over the next 10 years. Just over half, $20.5 billion, would come from cuts to the food stamp program, known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.         \n\nThe House bill, like the Senate\u2019s, would have eliminated the $5 billion-a-year subsidies paid to farmers and landowners whether they plant crops or not. The billions of dollars saved would be directed into the $9 billion crop insurance program, and new subsidies would be created for peanut, cotton and rice farmers. The bill adds money to support fruit and vegetable growers, and it restores insurance programs for livestock producers, which expired in 2011, leaving thousands of operations without disaster coverage during last year\u2019s drought.         \n\nNot surprisingly, the nearly $75-billion food stamp program was the focus of most of the farm bill debate. Democrats, led by Representative Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, said that the cuts to the program were too steep and introduced an amendment that would scale them back by cutting funds for crop insurance. Lawmakers rejected the amendment, 234 to 188.         \n\nThe lawmakers did pass two amendments, one to allow states to drug test food stamp applicants, and the other to require food stamp recipients to meet federal welfare work requirements.
