{"headline": "Brazen Attacks at Prisons Raise Worries of Al Qaeda\u2019s Strength in Iraq", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The brazen assaults on two prisons in Iraq this week were significant not only for the hundreds of prisoners who were freed but also for what they indicate about the growing capabilities of Al Qaeda\u2019s Iraq affiliate, American officials and experts outside government said Tuesday.         \n\nThe attacks on the prisons at Abu Ghraib and Taji were carefully synchronized operations in which members of the Qaeda affiliate used mortars to pin down Iraqi forces, employed suicide bombers to punch holes in their defenses and then sent an assault force to free the inmates, Western experts said.         \n\n\u201cWe are concerned about the increased tempo and sophistication of Al Qaeda operations in Iraq,\u201d said a senior State Department official, who requested anonymity because he did not want to be seen as commenting on Iraq\u2019s internal affairs.         \n\nJames F. Jeffrey, who was the United States ambassador in Baghdad when the last American troops left in December 2011, said that Iraqi forces had performed poorly and that it was clear their skills had deteriorated now that the American troops training them were gone.         \n\n\u201cThis is the first example I have seen that the absence of American troops that would have provided tactical training has had an impact on the battlefield,\u201d said Mr. Jeffrey, who is now a visiting fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.         \n\nThe assaults\u2019 audacity underscored the worsening conditions in Iraq, where stability has been undermined by almost daily car bombings and other violence tied to a resurgence of sectarian tensions, largely between the majority Shiites and minority Sunnis.         \n\n\u00a0Al Qaeda\u2019s affiliate in Iraq is a largely homegrown organization of Sunni militant extremists that includes some foreign fighters and has had some foreign leaders.         \n\n\u201cThis attack is unlike any other attack when they target a coffee shop or a public market,\u201d said Hamid Fadhil, a political science professor at Baghdad University. \u201cThey are targeting the most secured place with big numbers of security forces.\u201d         \n\nOther Iraqis said the prison break had intensified their fears of being killed or wounded by just venturing outside at the wrong time. \u201cIf Al Qaeda can attack a prison, it means they can do whatever they want whenever they want,\u201d said a lawyer, Meluk Abdil Wahab, 45.         \n\nThousands of inmates have been housed in Taji and Abu Ghraib, the prison made infamous by the Iraqi prisoner abuse scandal during the eight-year American occupation, and there were conflicting accounts by Qaeda affiliates and Iraqi security officials on the number of escapees and casualties.         \n\nBut there appeared to be little dispute that hundreds of prisoners, some of whom had been captured by American forces before they withdrew, were now on the loose, an outcome that sent fear through Baghdad and beyond.         \n\nAl Qaeda said 500 inmates had escaped from the two prisons, all of them mujahedeen, or holy warriors. Iraqi officials said 800 prisoners had fled from Abu Ghraib, of whom 400 had been recaptured or killed.         \n\nThey said that no prisoners had escaped from Taji, but that an unspecified number had been killed there.         \n\nThere have been other signs that Al Qaeda\u2019s affiliate is becoming a growing threat. About 80 car bombs and suicide bombings were carried out in May, the kinds of attacks generally associated with it. That was the highest number of such attacks since March 2008.         \n\nBut Mr. Jeffrey said that the prison breakout was especially worrisome because it would strengthen extremist fighters in the region and encourage some Iraqis in Sunni areas to take a more militant stance, since the episode would be seen as sign that the Qaeda affiliate was getting stronger while the Iraqi government forces were ineffective.         \n\n\u201cIt will provide seasoned leadership and a morale boost to Al Qaeda and its allies in both Iraq and Syria,\u201d Mr. Jeffrey said. \u201cAnd it is likely to have an electrifying impact on the Sunni population in Iraq, which has been sitting on the fence.\u201d         \n\nThe escape of Qaeda-linked prisoners is also likely to increase the threat to the leaders of Sunni tribes that aligned themselves with American troops during the troop \u201csurge\u201d in 2007 and 2008 and fought the extremist group.         \n\nKirk Sowell, the editor of the newsletter  \n said the episode had also further damaged Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki\u2019s carefully devised image as the man who brought order to Iraq \u2014 all the more so since Mr. Maliki has controlled the appointment of senior military officials and maintained a tight hold on the Defense and Interior Ministries.         \n\n\u201cThe glow that Maliki had of being the strong leader who rebuilt Iraq, that\u2019s gone,\u201d Mr. Sowell said.         \n\nIn another development that has chipped away at Mr. Maliki\u2019s reputation, Mr. Sowell noted, the commander of Iraq\u2019s 17th Division recently resigned with a blast at Iraq\u2019s political leadership.         \n\nIn its statement, the Qaeda affiliate said that the prison breakout was called \u201cCrushing the Tyrants\u201d and that it had taken place precisely one year after its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, announced a campaign to free prisoners from jails around the country, according to SITE, a research organization that monitors jihadist Web sites.         \n\nThere have been other prison breakouts, including a September 2012  \n that freed more than 100 prisoners. The Iraqi government later said it had recaptured more than 40 of them.         \n\nBut the latest breakout was on a much greater scale.         \n\nAccording to the Qaeda-affiliated account, the planners of the assaults, which began Sunday evening, coordinated the detonation of 12 car bombs and a barrage of mortar rounds and rockets to kill sentries outside the prisons, as groups of heavily armed assailants, who had taken an oath not to emerge alive until the prisoners were freed, breached the entrances.         \n\nAn emergency committee formed by Mr. Maliki to investigate the attacks said its initial findings suggested that \u201csome of the guards were involved with the terrorist attackers.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/24/world/middleeast/al-qaeda-asserts-responsibility-for-iraqi-prison-breaks.html", "date": "2013-07-23", "description": "The audacity of the assaults on Sunday, in which hundreds of inmates escaped, underscored the deterioration of Iraq\u2019s stability in recent months."}
