{"headline": "C.E.O.\u2019s Don\u2019t Need to Earn Less. They Need to Sweat More.", "body": "\nOne recent Thursday, G. Steven Farris, the chairman and C.E.O. of the poorly performing oil-and-gas company Apache, stood before a few hundred shareholders who were about to vote on his salary. Farris, who was hoping to earn well over $10 million for this year, listed a number of his accomplishments. \u201cWe\u2019re the No. 1 driller in the Permian Basin,\u201d he said, referring to the oil reserves in West Texas and New Mexico. But some shareholders, most likely mindful of the company\u2019s falling stock price, noted that the proposed pay package seemed out of whack. Still, the tally was a nail-biter: 49.8 percent of the votes favored giving Farris the bump.         \n\nMost C.E.O.\u2019s used to be able to handle their pay negotiations in private, but the Dodd-Frank reforms, which were passed in 2010, now give shareholders the right to vote on  \n. This has helped usher in a so-called \u201csay on pay\u201d revolution, which tries to stop executives from making more money when their companies don\u2019t do that well. In Switzerland, a recent nationwide referendum, passed 2 to 1, gave shareholders the right to restrict the pay for the heads of Swiss companies. The European Union is likely to vote on a similar measure by the end of the year.         \n\nC.E.O.\u2019s like Farris have long argued that they should make more money, but what\u2019s surprising is that many business-school professors make the case even more energetically. The standard defense is that a talented marketing director or chief engineer can help a company thrive, but the next-best candidate will probably be successful, too. A great C.E.O., they say, is many times better than an average one, and those great ones need high-powered incentives. C.E.O.-friendly economists also suggest that the salary is moot if the chief executive is creating many multiples of their pay in shareholder value. Some of these enthusiasts point out that Steve Jobs rescued Apple (after his exodus) in 1997, when it was near bankruptcy, and turned it into one of the most valuable companies ever. Jobs was worth an estimated $7 billion at his death, but he made hundreds of billions of dollars for his shareholders. Many now say he was underpaid.         \n\nC.E.O.\u2019s might indeed need significant incentives, but the problem is that most of them don\u2019t perform like Steve Jobs even when they get them. The financial research firm Obermatt recently compared the compensation of C.E.O.\u2019s at publicly traded firms and their performance and found no correlation between the two. Like a bottle of wine or a promising college quarterback turning pro, C.E.O.\u2019s are similar to what economists call experience goods: you commit to a price long before you know if they\u2019re worth it. Just ask the shareholders of J.C. Penney, which ousted its C.E.O., Ron Johnson, less than 18 months after hiring him away from Apple. Under his leadership, the company lost more than $500 million in a single quarter.         \n\nSo far, the \u201csay on pay\u201d revolution feels more like the second season of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of drama, a bit of blood, some cheers, but things end up more or less exactly where they started. While the Dodd-Frank law requires a shareholder vote on executive pay at least every three years, the vote is not binding. Apache\u2019s board eventually lowered Farris\u2019s package by around $3 million, but it is the exception. Shareholders ended up approving pay packages around 97 percent of the time. A vast majority of overpaid C.E.O.\u2019s, it seems, have little to fear from all these new guidelines.         \n\nEconomically speaking, this is more than a little odd. Shareholders should be motivated to pay their C.E.O.\u2019s according to their success. But doing so involves a tricky dance known to game theorists as the principal-agent problem: how does an employer (the principal) motivate a worker (the agent) to pursue the principal\u2019s interest? This principal-agent problem is everywhere. (Do you pay a contractor per day of work or per project? Do you pay salespeople by the hour or on commission?) It becomes particularly thorny when the agent knows a lot more about his job than the principal. George Costanza was a comic incarnation of the principal-agent problem. He constantly invented schemes to make his employer think he was doing his job well when he wasn\u2019t doing much at all. \u201cWhen you look annoyed all the time,\u201d he once told Jerry and Elaine, \u201cpeople think that you\u2019re busy.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/magazine/ceos-dont-need-to-earn-less-they-need-to-sweat-more.html", "date": "2013-05-29", "description": "What George Costanza and artful ineptitude can teach us about executive pay."}
