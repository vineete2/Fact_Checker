But I would like to chime in on all of the excitement that\u2019s churning around the Met\u2019s long-anticipated punk fashion exhibition that opens this week, and would love your take as well. What is punk? More than a particularly loud and rebellious musical style. A fashion anti-style. A lifestyle. As  \n, \"In music, punk remains what the critic Frank Kogan calls a \"Superword\" \u2014 a term whose main purpose is for people to fight over what it should mean,\" adding, \"It's a concept like \"freedom\" or \"the one true Church\" or \"real Americans\": to invoke it is to advance a vision of what it entails, and duke it out with competing visions.\" My visual is spiked hair, piercings, studs, ripped clothing held together by safety pins, chains, black lipstick, black everything. The soundtrack is scowling, screaming music, raging against the establishment. A counter-culture subculture. Johnny Rotten of the Sex Pistols summed it up: \u201cDon\u2019t accept the old order. Get rid of it.\u201d         \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n         \n\nThe punk movement was born in England and the United States the 1970s. I was around, but I wasn\u2019t paying attention. Punk is still around, in dress and culture and sound.         \n\n\u201cThe first thing you notice is that punk rock fans look as devastating as their music sounds,\u201d Janet Street-Porter observed on a 1976 episode of \u201cThe London Weekend Show.\u201d \u201cThe whole idea is to shock outsiders.\u201d And they did. They made voyeurs out of us, intrigued. There we were one Saturday night in 1982 when a group of us (costumed imposters) went to one of the original punk clubs in  \n on our way home from a black tie charity event for the Lincoln Park Zoo. I was 25. One of our friends suggested we stop there. It felt intimidating just to enter. In our gowns and tuxedos we stepped in, under the skull and crossbones sign over the door. (The sign is still there and reads, \"Chicago's Original Punk Bar since 1981 \u2014 Open 365 Days til 4 a.m.) We followed the music. When we entered, we saw a sea of black, an undulating dance floor of people, and lots of eyes \u2014 on us. What to do? Dance, of course. It was good. Our friend Tom went up to a pierced, tattooed woman wearing a dog collar and asked her to dance. When she stood up, so did her friend:- they were chained together. But they danced. Sweet gesture? Opposites attracting? Joke on us? We'll never know. Sex Pistols, the Ramones, the Clash, Social Distortion, Iggy & the Stooges \u2014 the original punk sound. I'll let them scream for themselves.         \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n         \n\nI told my high school intern that I was writing about punk music and, pen in hand, asked what new punk bands they listen to. \"My friends who listen to punk listen to old punk,\" she told me. Let\u2019s not tell that to today\u2019s punk bands.         \n\nModern punk actually has many fans, including Vanessa Franko, who writes the  \nblog for The Press-Enterprise of Riverside and San Bernadino Counties in California. So I\u2019m going to hand this over to her. Earlier this year she  \nat the Coachella music fest this spring. They\u2019re not all new; in fact, even though I don\u2019t care for punk music, two of the five have some quieter tracks and are on my music Web site,  \n. Her list and reasons: Descendents (\u201d \u2018Everything Sucks\u2019 is one of my favorite records, one I love so much it would go to a deserted island with me.\u201d); Social Distortion (\u201cThere will be certain points during Coachella when I\u2019ll forget that I\u2019m working and just scream along and it\u2019s going to be when Social D plays \u2018Mommy\u2019s Little Monster'\u201d); The Gaslight Anthem (\u201cStraight out of New Jersey, they are the perfect blend of Bruce Springsteen and the Bouncing Souls\u201d); Dropkick Murphys (\u201cBoston\u2019s finest, are one of my all-time favorite bands. I even ended up on stage once during the finale of \u201cSkinhead on the MBTA.\u201d They have a great new record out called, \u201cSigned and Sealed in Blood\u201d; and Jello Biafra and the Guantanamo School of Medicine (Mr. Biafra is the former frontman for the San Francisco band Dead Kennedys; at 54 he can aerobicize to DK\u2019s \u201cHoliday in Cambodia.\u201d)         \n\nAnd I\u2019m adding one more name, which you\u2019ve probably heard \u2014 Green Day, a band that formed in 1987 as part of the Berkeley, Calif., punk scene. One of the world\u2019s best-selling bands of all time (more than 75 million albums sold worldwide, five Grammy Awards), they\u2019re noted for popularizing and reviving a mainstream interest in punk music in the United States. Exhibit A: Their rock opera, \"American Idiot\" (based on their 2004 studio album), opened on Broadway in 2010 and was a huge success.         \n\nIs punk for everyone? That's a definite no. Owen Deutsche, a Chicago high school senior says punk speaks to him because \"Punk is not about exclusion but about undermining establishments which do exclude.\" This I\u2019ve learned about punk: It won\u2019t take a lot of listening to know if it\u2019s for you.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/07/booming/from-sex-pistols-to-gaslight-anthem-and-green-day.html", "date": "2013-05-07", "description": "Punk music transcends generations, with old punk drawing new fans and new bands rising up to scream."}
