{"headline": "In Climbing Income Ladder, Location Matters", "body": "\nATLANTA \u2013 Stacey Calvin spends almost as much time commuting to her job \u2014 on a bus, two trains and another bus \u2014 as she does working part-time at a day care center. She knows exactly where to board the train and which stairwells to use at the stations so that she has the best chance of getting to work on time in the morning and making it home to greet her three children after school.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a science you just have to perfect over time,\u201d said Ms. Calvin, 37.         \n\nHer nearly four-hour round-trip stems largely from the economic geography of Atlanta, which is one of America\u2019s most affluent metropolitan areas yet also one of the most physically divided by income. The low-income neighborhoods here often stretch for miles, with rows of houses and low-slung apartments, interrupted by the occasional strip mall, and lacking much in the way of good-paying jobs.         \n\nThis geography appears to play a major role in making Atlanta one of the metropolitan areas where it is most difficult for lower-income households to rise into the middle class and beyond,\u00a0 \n\u00a0that other researchers are calling the most detailed portrait yet of income mobility in the United States.         \n\nThe study \u2014 based on millions of anonymous earnings records and being released this week by a team of top academic economists \u2014 is the first with enough data to compare upward mobility across metropolitan areas. These comparisons provide some of the most powerful evidence so far about the factors that seem to drive people\u2019s chances of rising beyond the station of their birth, including education, family structure and the economic layout of metropolitan areas.         \n\nClimbing the income ladder occurs less often in the Southeast and industrial Midwest, the data shows, with the odds notably low in Atlanta, Charlotte, Memphis, Raleigh, Indianapolis, Cincinnati and Columbus. By contrast, some of the highest rates occur in the Northeast, Great Plains and West, including in New York, Boston, Salt Lake City, Pittsburgh, Seattle and large swaths of California and Minnesota.         \n\n\u201cWhere you grow up matters,\u201d said\u00a0 \n, a Harvard economist and one of the study\u2019s authors. \u201cThere is tremendous variation across the U.S. in the extent to which kids can rise out of poverty.\u201d         \n\nThat variation does not stem simply from the fact that some areas have higher average incomes: upward mobility rates, Mr. Hendren added, often differ sharply in areas where average income is similar, like Atlanta and Seattle.         \n\nThe gaps can be stark. On average, fairly poor children in Seattle \u2014 those who grew up in the 25th percentile of the national income distribution \u2014 do as well financially when they grow up as middle-class children \u2014 those who grew up at the 50th percentile \u2014 from Atlanta.         \n\nGeography mattered much less for well-off children than for middle-class and poor children, according to the results. In an economic echo of Tolstoy\u2019s line about happy families being alike, the chances that affluent children grow up to be affluent are broadly similar across metropolitan areas.         \n\nThe team of researchers initially analyzed an enormous database of earnings records to study tax policy, hypothesizing that different local and state tax breaks might affect intergenerational mobility.         \n\nWhat they found surprised them, said\u00a0 \n, one of the authors and the most recent winner of the\u00a0 \n, which the American Economic Association awards to the country\u2019s best academic economist under the age of 40. The researchers concluded that larger tax credits for the poor and higher taxes on the affluent seemed to improve income mobility only slightly. The economists also found only modest or no correlation between mobility and the number of local colleges and their tuition rates or between mobility and the amount of extreme wealth in a region.         \n\nBut the researchers identified four broad factors that appeared to affect income mobility, including the size and dispersion of the local middle class. All else being equal, upward mobility tended to be higher in metropolitan areas where poor families were more dispersed among mixed-income neighborhoods.         \n\nIncome mobility was also higher in areas with more  \n better elementary schools and high schools, and more civic engagement, including membership in religious and community groups.         \n\nRegions with larger black populations had lower upward-mobility rates. But the researchers\u2019 analysis suggested that this was not primarily because of their race. Both white and black residents of Atlanta have low upward mobility, for instance.         \n\nThe authors emphasize that their data allowed them to identify only correlation, not causation. Other economists said that future studies will be important for sorting through the patterns in this new data.         \n\nStill, earlier studies have already found that\u00a0 \n\u00a0and\u00a0 \n\u00a0have a large effect on the chances that children escape poverty. Other researchers, including the political scientist Robert D. Putnam, author of\u00a0 \n\u00a0have previously argued that social connections play an important role in a community\u2019s success.\u00a0 \n\u00a0has become one of the hottest topics in economics, as both liberals and conservatives have grown worried about diminished opportunities following more than a decade of disappointing economic growth. After years of focusing more on inequality at a moment in time, economists have more recently turned their attention to people\u2019s paths over their lifetimes.         \n\nPolls show that Americans are worried about whether living standards will rise for most people in coming decades, as they have for nearly all of the nation\u2019s history. In interviews in Atlanta and its suburbs, residents reflected many of the national concerns and many of the patterns in the study.         \n\nJose Lopez, a 40-year-old who runs a local painting crew, said he wished he had enough time, amid work and parenthood, to go back to school.         \n\nLampra Jones, a recent graduate of a chiropractic program who has struggled to find work, called herself \u201ca loner\u201d and said she wished she knew more people to help with her job search. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know the right people,\u201d said Ms. Jones, 28, \u201cyou\u2019re not going to get anywhere.\u201d         \n\nMichael Novajovsky, a father of three in Gwinnett County with a temporary job as a network engineer, said in an interview that the struggle to build a better life often felt similar to \u201ca lottery.\u201d His job pays $27 an hour but comes with no health insurance for him, his wife and his three children.         \n\nHis wife, Sherrie, recently left a job at a diner that required an hour\u2019s commute by bus. She would like to find a new job with health insurance, but the family has only one car. \u201cI\u2019d work just to have insurance,\u201d Ms. Novajovsky said.         \n\nIn previous studies of mobility, economists have found that a smaller percentage of people escape childhood poverty in the United States than in several other rich countries, including Canada, Australia, France, Germany and Japan. The latest study is consistent with those findings.         \n\nWhatever the reasons, affluent children often remain so: one of every three 30-year-olds who grew up in the top 1 percent of the income distribution was already making at least $100,000 in family income, according to the new study. Among adults who grew up in the bottom half of the income distribution, only one out of 25 had family income of at least $100,000 by age 30.         \n\nYet the parts of this country with the highest mobility rates \u2014 like Pittsburgh, Seattle and Salt Lake City \u2014 have rates roughly as high as those in Denmark and Norway, two countries at the top of the international mobility rankings. In areas like Atlanta and Memphis, by comparison, upward mobility appears to be substantially lower than in any other rich country, Mr. Chetty said.         \n\nEspecially intriguing is the fact that children who moved at a young age from a low-mobility area to a high-mobility area did almost as well as those who spent their entire childhoods in a higher-mobility area. But children who moved as teenagers did less well.         \n\nThat pattern makes economists more confident that the  \n \u2014 as opposed to something inherent and unchangeable in the local residents \u2014 are helping cause the varying mobility rates.         \n\nLawrence Katz, a labor economist who did not work on the project, said he was struck by the fact that areas with high levels of income mobility were also those that established high school earliest and have long had strong school systems. Mr. Katz, a Harvard economist and former Clinton administration official, called the work \u201ccertainly the most comprehensive analysis of intergenerational mobility in the contemporary U.S.\u201d         \n\nThe project\u2019s other researchers were Patrick Kline, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and Emmanuel Saez, a Berkeley economist who won the Clark Medal in 2009.         \n\nThe comparison of metropolitan areas allows researchers to consider local factors that previous mobility studies could not \u2014 including a region\u2019s geography. And in Atlanta, the most common lament seems to be precisely that concentrated poverty, extensive traffic and a weak public-transit system make it difficult to get to the job opportunities. \u201cWhen poor communities are segregated,\u201d said Cindia Cameron, an organizer for 9 to 5, a women\u2019s rights group, \u201ceverything about life is harder.\u201d         \n\nMs. Calvin, the day care worker who commutes more than three hours, recently tried to rent an apartment closer to her job, in a better school district and a neighborhood closer to grocery stores. But the landlords required more income than her roughly $1,200 in monthly take-home pay, she said.         \n\nShe now plans to stay for another couple of years in her three-bedroom home, in a set of tan garden apartments in DeKalb County, east of Atlanta. By then, she expects to have married her boyfriend \u2014 they are recently engaged \u2014 and may be able to afford to move.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little disappointed I had to renew my lease,\u201d she said. But she is happy that she has a routine that allows her to play an active role in her children\u2019s school, including with the PTA, and to be home when they arrive home.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s enough to get by,\u201d Ms. Calvin said.
