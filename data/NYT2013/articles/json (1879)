{"headline": "Ten Years Later, Infamous Cubs Fan Remains Invisible", "body": "\nCHICAGO \u2014 Steve Bartman sat in the first row down the left-field line for Game 6 of the National League Championship Series between the  \n and the Florida Marlins at Wrigley Field on Oct. 14, 2003. He wore a green turtleneck and had headphones over his Cubs cap. By the end of the night, he was the most infamous fan, perhaps, in the history of American sports.         \n\nThe Cubs were ahead, 3-0, in the eighth inning, five outs from their first World Series appearance in 58 years, when Bartman  \n a foul ball that left fielder Moises Alou had leapt for and appeared ready to catch. The Marlins went on to  \n in the inning, win the game and then win the series the next night.         \n\nIn the 10 years since, Bartman, 36, has all but disappeared, turning down more than 200 news media requests, including \u201cToday\u201d and \u201cDr. Phil,\u201d and has not returned to Wrigley, as far as anyone knows.         \n\nBartman still lives in the Chicago area and works for a financial services consulting firm.         \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s happy and healthy and he\u2019s still a Cubs fan,\u201d said Frank Murtha, a longtime friend and a spokesman for Bartman. \u201cHe values his privacy.\u201d         \n\nThrough Murtha, Bartman declined to be interviewed for this article.         \n\nAs Bartman became the symbol of the 2003 Cubs\u2019 playoff collapse, the organization contacted him to say he was always welcome at Wrigley.         \n\n\u201cI never wanted there to be any lingering animosity,\u201d Jim Hendry, then the Cubs\u2019 general manager and now a member of the Yankees\u2019 front office, said last week.         \n\nBartman rebuffed the overtures, Murtha said, to avoid the notoriety and the inevitable uproar afterward. He has also turned down financial opportunities in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, Murtha said. Although a 10-year exile is a long time for Bartman, the Cubs said there were no plans to invite him back to Wrigley next spring for a special appearance.         \n\nBut the Cubs have not won a playoff game since 2003 and have now lost 197 games the past two seasons. Their mind-boggling championship drought stands at 105 years. Might enough be enough, finally? Could a moment between Bartman and Cubs fans heal his wounds and, as silly as it sounds, chase whatever supernatural juju seems embedded in the Wrigley bricks? After all, nothing else has worked.         \n\n\u201cIt would certainly be a nice gesture,\u201d said Scott Turow, an author and a lifelong Cubs fan. \u201cWhether it would work, who knows?\u201d         \n\nAmong Cubs fans, players and Chicagoans who were interviewed, most feel tremendous sympathy for Bartman. He was hidden inside the stadium during the remainder of Game 6 after he became the target of abusive fans. He was dressed in a disguise to leave Wrigley and hustled to a safe place after the game.         \n\nMost agree that Bartman was a small part of that fateful eighth inning. The Marlins clubbed four hits after the foul ball, and shortstop Alex Gonzalez booted a potential inning-ending double-play ball. \u201cHe didn\u2019t cost us anything,\u201d said the former Cubs pitcher Mark Prior, who was on the mound when Bartman deflected the ball.         \n\nThe comedian Jeff Garlin, a Cubs fan, said, \u201cI want to find Bartman and give him a hug and tell him, \u2018It\u2019s O.K.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nStill, whether a public appearance at Wrigley could help release Bartman from his moment of infamy, and the Cubs from their own history, remains in question. David Kaplan, a radio and television host in Chicago, said a Bartman appearance at the stadium would be strange.         \n\n\u201cIt would be like a sideshow, the same kind of publicity stunt he\u2019s been avoiding for years,\u201d Kaplan said.         \n\nThe Chicago Sun-Times columnist Rick Telander said of Cubs fans: \u201cThey\u2019d rip him apart. He can\u2019t just waltz in when the Cubs are still losers and expect to be cheered.\u201d         \n\nMichael Wilbon, a Cubs fan and a host of ESPN\u2019s \u201cPardon the Interruption,\u201d found the idea incredible.         \n\n\u201cA Steve Bartman night? Are you kidding me?\u201d Wilbon asked. \u201cWhat does the organization have to gain by that? I\u2019ll tell you: nothing.\u201d         \n\nIf the goal is to move past the game, said Doug Glanville, an outfielder with the Cubs during 2003 who lived in Chicago for many years, then any public event detracts from that.         \n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t minimize it by calling more attention to it,\u201d he said.
