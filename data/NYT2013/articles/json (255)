{"headline": "Licensed to Grill: Mike D\u2019s Brooklyn Town House", "body": "\nMichael Diamond was sitting in his Cobble Hill town house, marveling at the virtues of a backyard. \u201cWhen I was growing up in New York, we were the anomaly,\u201d said Mr. Diamond, better known as Mike D of the Beastie Boys. \u201cOur family stayed, but back then families didn\u2019t stay. Once you had a second kid, you immediately left, so the kids could run around outside.\u201d         \n\nMr. Diamond, who prefers not to give his age, now has two boys of his own, Davis, 10, and Skyler, 8, with his wife, Tamra Davis, a filmmaker, who also prefers not to give her age. The outdoor space is a recent addition. A year and a half ago, the family left their TriBeCa loft for what Mr. Diamond, who grew up on the Upper West Side, calls \u201cthe suburban dream in Brooklyn.\u201d         \n\nAs his wife observed, there was a steep learning curve involved. \u201cHe had  \nlived outside of Manhattan,\u201d said Ms. Davis, who is from Southern California.         \n\nThe result, however, was worth it. Now their older son can walk home from school by himself, an experience Mr. Diamond missed out on as a child, although his school was only two blocks away. \u201cIt was traumatic,\u201d he said. \u201cA very different city.\u201d         \n\nAnother advantage of life in Brooklyn: \u201cWe can have dinner outside,\u201d Mr. Diamond said, pointing out the basil they used in the previous night\u2019s pasta and the strawberry plants he hopes will grow. \u201cThe kids can eat, then run down and play basketball.\u201d         \n\nRenovating the 3,200-square-foot house wasn\u2019t nearly as challenging as moving to Brooklyn. That may be because he and Ms. Davis are so aesthetically compatible, Mr. Diamond said.         \n\nHow would he describe their aesthetic?         \n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s kind of vernacular, sensitive, modern,\u201d he said.         \n\nMs. Davis interrupted: \u201cWhoa.\u201d         \n\n\u201cDoes that sound pretentious?\u201d he asked. \u201cWell, I\u2019m saying we are good at responding to prevailing culture in a house.\u201d         \n\nThe renovation took about six months. \u201cOur goal was to limit our total reno-architecture budget to under $500,000,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich we pretty much succeeded in. It meant that at times we\u2019d splurge on one light fixture, but not another. And it helped because we ended up having to retain original detail, clean it up and leave it as is.\u201d         \n\nThey moved the master bedroom to the top floor for privacy, ripping out the dropped ceiling to create a feeling of space and light. The adjoining bathroom is huge, with a tub in the center of the room.         \n\nThe boys\u2019 rooms are on the floor below, \u201ccompletely in their own world,\u201d Mr. Diamond said, with space in between for impromptu soccer games.         \n\nOn the ground floor is a screening room and a home office that the couple share, in alternating shifts. Ms. Davis uses it when she is editing films; Mr. Diamond works on his own projects here and at Oscilloscope Laboratories, the independent film company co-founded by Adam Yauch, the Beastie Boys member who died last year. \u201cIt has to be for a couple of months each,\u201d Mr. Diamond said. \u201cDual-use concurrently doesn\u2019t work.\u201d         \n\nMost of all, the house has given them peace and privacy. \u201cLofts are great,\u201d Mr. Diamond said. \u201cBut with a home, there is a lot to be said for delineated space. To have the luxury of a little separate work space is huge \u2014 and to have the dream-sequence master bath.\u201d         \n\nApart from adding a marble island and a backsplash for the stove, they didn\u2019t do much to the kitchen, which is mostly Ms. Davis\u2019s domain. She is the one with the  \n, after all, and the  \n to her name.         \n\nBut Mr. Diamond takes exception to the suggestion that he doesn\u2019t cook, and is quick to note that he\u2019s considering buying a barbecue for grilling fish and vegetables on the deck.         \n\n\u201cFor a dude, I think I do cook,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a stay-at-home parent a lot of the time.\u201d         \n\nHe paused and considered.         \n\n\u201cWhat is the right term for that?\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a multi-dad.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/13/greathomesanddestinations/licensed-to-grill-mike-ds-brooklyn-town-house.html", "date": "2013-06-12", "description": "Michael Diamond, also known as one of the Beastie Boys, chills in the \u2018burbs, his first move out of Manhattan."}
