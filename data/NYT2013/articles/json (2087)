{"headline": "Bonfire of My Vanity", "body": "\nHello, 56!         \n\nI\u2019ve worked hard to maintain my youthful vigor: I do yoga inversions, take ice baths, slather sunscreen, and have even drunk butter \u201cbulletproof\u201d coffee (reputed to enhance cognitive thinking). Then, of course, there\u2019s my \u201cpersistent immaturity\u201d \u2014 wearing neon-colored skinny jeans, laughing out loud and mercilessly teasing my friends.         \n\nOh, and a little strategic nip and tuck hasn\u2019t hurt either.         \n\nMy hair has been perhaps the most effective camouflage of my age. A decade ago, when Diane Sawyer of ABC and I were hosting an event together, she gave me unsolicited advice that I took to heart: \u201cAnchors don\u2019t get older, they get blonder.\u201d I have never exactly lied about my age, although in recent years I have managed to skirt the issue. But there\u2019s no place to hide when your age is printed in your New York Times wedding announcement, as  \n. (\u201cSteven Petrow, 56 \u2026.\u201d) My chagrin did lift considerably when this disclosure produced a flutter of flattery from friends and acquaintances. It turns out, \u201cI don\u2019t look at day over \u2026 50.\u201d         \n\nThanks to Ms. Sawyer\u2019s advice, I\u2019ve regularly visited a salon for highlights, adding three separate tones to mime my \u201ctrue\u201d color and to obfuscate the gradual infestation of gray. According to Multi-sponsor Surveys, a research firm, I\u2019m hardly alone: 10 percent of boomer men now color their hair to look younger, up from 3 percent in 1999.         \n\nSix years ago, when I hit the midcentury mark, I made an appointment with a plastic surgeon for lower eyelid surgery, a laser procedure to remove the saggy and soggy bags under my baby blues. Again, I was hardly an outlier. Data from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons show that more men are opting for a variety of procedures, with a 22 percent increase between 2000 and 2012.         \n\nWhen my face fully healed (it took at least a year), I felt good about the results. I got exactly the kind of responses the ads had promised: \u201cYou look so relaxed!\u201d and \u201cDid you lose weight?\u201d I also knew it was a good career move: In the digital publishing company where I worked, I was already the third oldest out of 500-some employees and nearly 20 years older than my C.E.O. boss. With young folks so steadily replacing veterans, the procedure seemed like just another way to stay at the top of my game.         \n\nFinally, my age charade caught up with me. I had been seeing a new hair cutter (let\u2019s call him Alejandro) and one day I mentioned that I was doing a video series to promote my latest book. Alejandro, quite nonchalantly, offered a \u201cnatural\u201d process that would remove between a quarter and third of my gray. \u201cNo one will notice,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s semipermanent\"\u2014 in case I hated it, it would fade soon enough.         \n\nI said \u201cyes\u201d to the bottle because in midlife I try not to sweat the small things. Before I knew it, Alejandro had mixed together a thick paste and was massaging it into my scalp. Thirty minutes later, rinsed and dried, my faux \u201choney blond\u201d hair was not what I had hoped. It screamed: \u201cDye job!\u201d But Alejandro told me I looked \u201cfantastic,\u201d and one of his other clients helpfully pointed out, \u201cYour hair matches your eyebrows now.\u201d         \n\nKnowing that I am susceptible to Vanity Sensitivity Syndrome (a bad haircut can lead to a drop in my dopamine levels), I drove carefully home and tried my best not to look at myself in the rear view mirror. But my partner was shocked. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d he stammered. That was a big deal: This is a man who had never noticed, much less commented on, a single haircut or color job in my past.         \n\nI swung into action. I jumped in the shower and shampooed my hair a half-dozen times in a row. It was no good getting the \u201choney\u201d out; my scalp just stung. My fine hair had turned brittle. The next day I got back into Alejandro\u2019s chair and endured a second chemical process to remove the color; I almost fainted from the fumes and the results were even worse: My hair was now brassy on the sides and white on top!         \n\nThe video shoot that had inspired this whole drama was scheduled for the next day and so I called my friend Vicki, my personal Heloise. She recommended a Fifth Avenue \u201ccolor correction specialist,\u201d let\u2019s call her Bridgette, who squeezed me in at 8 a.m.         \n\nI came with evidence, bringing Bridgette a series of photos of my \u201creal\u201d hair color. She examined the damage with a long series of grunts and sighs. There was nothing short of \u201cpermanent\u201d about this hair crisis, she told me. But she did a pretty good job of painting color back into my pale fuzz, before sending me on my way with a $400 tab. (Who knew that Uptown hair salons had A.T.M.s on the premises for guys like me whose wallets are unprepared for the sticker shock?)         \n\nAt the shoot later that day, nearly everyone commented on how \u201cgood\u201d my hair looked, but I knew it wasn\u2019t true when a famously honest friend told me I looked like a \u201ctrashy secretary\u201d from New Jersey. I wanted to cry.         \n\nI avoided mirrors for the next three months and counted down the days to the haircut that finally put an end to my summer as a blond.         \n\nRecently, I was chatting mindlessly with my aesthetician friend Rhonda about whether it might be a good time for me to consider having some sort of filler injected into my deepening cheek crevices. She knew all about my misadventures in the hair salon and discouraged this new area of \u201ccare.\u201d \u201cSteven, accept your authentic self,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful.\u201d         \n\nI suspect I will always vacillate in my self-acceptance. But for now I am calling a truce on my superficial efforts and I\u2019ve doubled down on downward dog, which is to say, my inner fountain of youth. To all those who wrote me after my traumatic wedding announcement outing to say that I don\u2019t look my age, let me now properly reply (with thanks to Gloria Steinem): \u201cThis is what 56 looks like.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/booming/bonfire-of-my-vanity.html", "date": "2013-11-21", "description": "Camouflaging my age always started with my hair, but then I had a misadventure at the salon, and things changed."}
