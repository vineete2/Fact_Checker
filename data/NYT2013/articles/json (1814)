{"headline": "That Nacho Dorito Taste", "body": "\nTHE INVENTOR OF DORITOS, a longtime Madison Avenue executive named Arch West, first envisioned this snack in 1964 as more than a golden-hued chip. He saw it as a marketing powerhouse, a vehicle for delivering endless varieties of new flavors.         \n\nBut none of the formulations would surpass one of the earliest: Nacho Cheese. This is the irresistible taste \u2014 with its coppery, finger-staining dust \u2014 that sent Doritos into the processed food hall of fame, and more recently into a partnership with Taco Bell. The resulting Doritos Locos Taco sold at the rate of one million a day when it was released in 2012, and now ranks as the most successful item on Taco Bell\u2019s menu.         \n\n\u201cWhat these are trying to do is excite every stinking taste bud receptor you have in your mouth,\u201d said Steven A. Witherly, a food scientist who wrote \u201cWhy Humans Like Junk Food,\u201d an insider\u2019s guide to the psychobiology of those cravings. I visited Mr. Witherly at his home near Los Angeles, where we raided his lab to do some tasting and experiments in search of what makes the chips and the taco so alluring.         \n\nGraphic:  \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/02/dining/the-nacho-dorito.html", "date": "2013-10-01", "description": "This is the irresistible flavor \u2014 with its coppery, finger-staining dust \u2014 that sent Doritos into the processed food hall of fame."}
