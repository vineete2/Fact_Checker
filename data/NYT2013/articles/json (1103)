{"headline": "A Top Iraqi Official\u2019s Advice to Karzai? Take America\u2019s Deal", "body": "\nKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 With one of the most important chapters of Afghanistan\u2019s history open before him, President Hamid Karzai took time this month for a personal meeting with the longtime foreign minister of Iraq, Hoshyar Zebari.         \n\nIt had been years since an Iraqi official had been to Afghanistan, and the trip was nominally meant to ease the passage of Afghan Shiites to holy shrines in Iraq. But it came right as Mr. Karzai had chosen to dig in and delay signing a security agreement with the United States, leaving long-term Western military support, and billions of dollars in aid, hanging in the balance.         \n\nIn a moment of candor, Mr. Zebari offered a piece of advice to the president that would have been unthinkable from an Iraqi official just two years ago: Get over your differences with the Americans and sign the deal.         \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be under the illusion that no matter what you do the Americans are here to stay,\u201d Mr. Zebari told Mr. Karzai. \u201cPeople used to say that about the American presence in Iraq, too. But they were eager to leave, and they will be eager to leave your country as well.\u201d         \n\nWhen the last American troops departed Iraq in 2011, after the collapse of a similar security agreement, many Iraqis reveled in a moment of national pride, expressing faith in the government\u2019s ability to maintain security. Since then, the country has fallen back into hellish violence, with thousands killed in sectarian attacks this year.         \n\nThe Iraqi government cannot even secure Baghdad anymore, despite billions of dollars in oil revenue and well-trained security forces, Mr. Zebari told the Afghan president, according to Iraqi and Afghan officials at the meeting. So how can the Afghan government, which can barely fund 20 percent of what it spends each year, hope to control the country without American help?         \n\nThe conversation was a resonant moment between two leaders at different points in their respective journeys \u2014 one pondering his country\u2019s post-American future, the other contending with it. With the benefit of hindsight, Mr. Zebari reached out to a president he scarcely knew, seizing on their shared experience at the crossroads of American involvement in the Muslim world.         \n\nSome of the parallels for Afghanistan are clear. As impasse has deepened into crisis, some of Mr. Karzai\u2019s closest aides have seized on Iraq as proof that the Americans could just walk away, leaving the country\u2019s security forces without military support and training in the middle of a war against the Taliban. Billions in badly needed international aid would also probably dry up, collapsing the economy. Worries about a return to civil war in Afghanistan would leap to center stage.         \n\nBut Mr. Karzai had heard it all before.         \n\nAmerican officials, in fact, have long used the withdrawal from Iraq as a cautionary example when talking with reporters and Afghan officials about the struggle to reach an Afghan security deal. And in the days after Mr. Karzai  \n, several senior American officials warned him that they would be forced to begin considering the \u201czero option\u201d \u2014 a total and final troop withdrawal in 2014 \u2014 if he did not reverse course.         \n\nAnd that was the way Mr. Karzai appeared to take Mr. Zebari\u2019s words, to the chagrin of Afghan officials who had hoped that their president might take heed of Iraq\u2019s troubles.         \n\n\u201cYou see?\u201d he told the small group of Afghan officials after the meeting ended. \u201cThe Americans want this deal so badly they are even getting the Iraqis to pressure me.\u201d         \n\nIn a telephone interview, Mr. Zebari insisted that his advice had merely been an expression of good will, not water-carrying for the Americans.         \n\n\u201cTwo years after the troop withdrawal, because of the rise of violence, we went back to Washington and asked them for continued support and military help,\u201d he said, referring to a  \n by the Iraqi prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, after a huge surge in attacks by Al Qaeda in Iraq and other Sunni militants. \u201cOne should really draw from that conclusion.\u201d         \n\nIn 2011, the deal effectively broke down over Iraqi domestic politics. But within Mr. Karzai\u2019s response to Mr. Zebari\u2019s plea lies one of the core reasons it might yet happen that the United States leaves Afghanistan outright, too, despite urgency within parts of the Obama administration not to see a decade of lost lives and treasure blown away.
