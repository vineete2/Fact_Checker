{"headline": "A Prairie Home, Abandoned", "body": "\nI was on the midway at the Central Wyoming Fair and Rodeo, holding a pink Reserve Champion ribbon that I won for a skirt and a blouse I made, when I accused my mother of not knowing how to sew. Calmly, she took the ribbon from me. \u201cI do sew,\u201d she told me. A British woman named Mrs. Piggott taught her how, 40 years before in India. I had never heard of her. At that age, I preferred stories set firmly in the American West.         \n\nGrowing up in Casper, I idolized Ma Ingalls in the \u201cLittle House on the Prairie\u201d books. Ma made rag dolls and taught her daughter Laura to make an intricate Dove in the Window quilt. Ma let the kids roast a pig\u2019s tail. She grew their vegetables in a garden and sewed all their clothes. My own mother bought our clothes at the mall. She didn\u2019t allow pork in the house and mostly cooked curry. The saris she wore didn\u2019t require needlework.         \n\nWhen I was 12, determined to learn the skills of a good homemaker, I joined 4-H. Our group was called the Baker\u2019s Dozen, and all year we learned a fairly antiquated set of skills \u2014 we baked bread, sewed, made preserves and cross-stitched. Our goal as we worked through the winter was to get ready for the county fair in the summer, and if we did well, the State Fair. Our leader taught us domestic skills and at the end led us in the 4-H pledge: \nI pledge my head to clearer thinking, my heart to greater loyalty, my hands to larger service and my health to better living, for my club, my community, my country, and my world.\u201d And every week when I went home, I grumbled that my mother didn\u2019t know how to bake cookies. She didn\u2019t quilt or crochet. She was no pioneer.         \n\nI had spent that spring carefully sewing straight stitches and redoing the yoke of my shirt several times. It was a simple outfit made of calico with yellow daisies patterned on it. I worked on it at my 4-H leader\u2019s house, and my mother never saw the outfit until I walked down the makeshift runway in the fashion show at the fairgrounds, winning the pink ribbon. Afterward we walked around the midway, eating fry bread and funnel cakes. My stomach was sick from the fried food and from riding roller coasters. I snapped at my mom.         \n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t you sew?\u201d I shouted. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you be like the other mothers?\u201d         \n\nStanding there in the middle of the noisy fair, I finally discovered that my mother was quite the homemaker \u2014 only she learned to make the wrong kind of home. She grew up in Chennai, then known as Madras, and she went to an Anglo-Indian school. She was just 7 when India became independent, and her school was still a holdover from British times. Many of the teachers were British, and each Indian girl in her class took domestic science. From British ladies, they learned to \u201cmanage a home,\u201d in the British way.         \n\nThey learned to do things that their counterparts in England were taught, despite the absurdities. My mother could make a Madeira cake, though at home she had no oven. She knew how to whip eggs for a blancmange and how to make calf\u2019s-foot jelly in case she needed to feed an invalid. Like most Indians, my mother never touched beef at home. They were taught to make a bed with a top sheet and crisp hospital corners. At home, she slept on a reed mat. She learned how to do a complete spring and summer cleaning, how to air a room and how to make a mustard poultice.         \n\nMy mother had been holding my pink ribbon, and she handed it back to me. \u201cIt\u2019s good you know how to sew,\u201d she said. \u201cYour outfit is beautiful. It\u2019s good to have skills. You never know when you\u2019ll need them.\u201d         \n\nShe had come a long way from living in India to standing with me at a county fair in Wyoming. She had skills she would never use and many that, as time went on, she would learn and adapt for her new life in America. She would learn to make us spaghetti, to take me to ski practice driving on icy roads and even to help me make the sheets look neat on my water bed.         \n\nEventually I came to understand that my Laura Ingalls Wilder fantasy was foolish. Life was awful for most women on the prairie. Besides, we\u2019d probably never have been friends, because I was brown, the daughter of a pioneer whose journey West required more than Ma Ingalls could ever know.
