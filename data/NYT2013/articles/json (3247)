{"headline": "Submit Your Real Estate Questions", "body": "\nGot an upstairs neighbor who thinks there\u2019s nothing wrong with coming home at 3 a.m. and hurling her three-inch heels across the uncarpeted hardwood floor? Or maybe you\u2019re wondering if your co-op can really just decide to ban pets and tell you to find a new home for your 55-pound bulldog. Or you want to know what to do about the next-door neighbor who installed an eight-foot fence that you\u2019re certain has veered into your backyard.         \n\nThese are the kinds of living-in-New York quandaries that we want to help you resolve.         \n\nNext month the Real Estate section is relaunching its Q. and A. column as \u201cAsk Real Estate,\u201d with a slightly broader focus. We\u2019ll still be tackling the often-confusing rules that govern co-op boards and rent-regulated apartments, but we may also venture beyond the realm of legal guidelines and seek out other ways to help New Yorkers cope with their living situations.         \n\nSo, whether you live in a studio apartment in  \n or a renovated colonial on an acre in the suburbs, share your real estate conundrums with us.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/realestate/submit-your-real-estate-questions.html", "date": "2013-11-15", "description": "Send your questions, share your stories and tell us what topics interest you most."}
