O\u2019Sullivan, president of the Laborers\u2019 International Union of North America. \u201cWe don\u2019t want it to be repealed. We want it to be fixed, fixed, fixed.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had our asses kicked on retirement security and we know our health funds are under siege,\u201d he added. \u201cWe ask the president and Congress to do the right thing for the men and women we represent.\u201d         \n\nThe resolution asserts that the law, by offering tax credits to workers seeking insurance from for-profit and other companies in the exchanges, will place some responsible employers at a competitive disadvantage and destabilize the employment-based health care system.         \n\nThe administration and health officials have repeatedly tried to assure critics that the legislation will not encourage companies to dump workers from employer-based plans into newly created health insurance exchanges, even if the employer-based coverage stands out as more generous and therefore more expensive for companies and even municipalities.         \n\nAt the convention, Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez\u2019s cautious response to questions about the leaders\u2019 concerns underscored how the complexities of the president\u2019s signature domestic accomplishment and a longstanding goal of labor continue to present political difficulties for Mr. Obama.         \n\nIn his speech before A.F.L.-C.I.O. members, Mr. Perez praised labor for helping enact the health law, but acknowledged that \u201cchallenges remain.\u201d         \n\nDuring an interview here, he said, \u201cThe administration has been working to address questions and concerns raised by a wide array of stakeholders.\u201d         \n\nMr. Trumka declined to offer details about his telephone conversation with Mr. Obama, except to say: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to solve problems.\u201d         \n\nHe and a group of union leaders also met late last month at the White House with Denis McDonough, the chief of staff, and Mr. Perez. Two other sessions have taken place since then with more junior administration officials, union officials said. The sit-down with Mr. Obama himself, Mr. Trumka and the union presidents is set for Friday.         \n\nAny erosion of health care benefits poses a singular threat to labor leaders, whose arsenal of tools to attract workers into union membership has dwindled alongside the decline of their organizations and their concomitant loss of influence around the country. Many unions and retirees have lost some benefits since the recession began, especially in the public sector as governments froze pension plans.
