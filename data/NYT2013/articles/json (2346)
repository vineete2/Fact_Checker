Four legs.         \n\nA surprising flash point \u2014 animal rights \u2014 has erupted in the early weeks of the race for New York City mayor, complete with boldface endorsers, voluble protests, and a generously financed attack ad.         \n\nNew York\u2019s animals, from Central Park horses to rescue shelter dogs, have one of the city\u2019s most clamorous lobbying groups, with thousands of motivated supporters and celebrity champions like Alec Baldwin, Lea Michele and Gloria Steinem.         \n\nAnd in a robust show of political muscle, a group of horse lovers is helping to back the first major advertising buy of the 2013 race: a $1 million attack on  \n, the City Council speaker, who, despite being a dog lover, has been a longtime target of animal rights advocates because of her support for horse-drawn carriages in Central Park.         \n\nMs. Quinn\u2019s rivals in the Democratic primary have taken notice.  \n, the public advocate, has promised that on his first day in City Hall, if elected, he would ban the famous carriages. He described the conditions of the horses, which have trotted through Central Park for decades, as \u201cinhumane.\u201d         \n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. de Blasio stood before dozens of self-proclaimed animal lovers at an Upper West Side fund-raiser hosted by the famed Pop artist Peter Max. Mr. de Blasio pledged to pursue a bill requiring sprinkler systems in pet stores.         \n\n\u201cHe just gets animal cruelty,\u201d said Mary Max, the wife of the artist and a director of the  \n. \u201cThis isn\u2019t somebody who we have to convince.\u201d By night\u2019s end, Mr. de Blasio, who has not owned a pet since childhood, had raised thousands of dollars for his campaign.         \n\nAnimals also cropped up last week at a candidate forum in Brooklyn, where one of the fiercest exchanges of the evening had to do not with policing tactics or affordable housing, but instead the fate of abandoned animals in the city\u2019s shelter system.         \n\nMs. Quinn \u2014 who walks Justin and Sadie, the Labrador mixes she owns with her spouse, Kim Catullo, on the sidewalks of Chelsea nearly every morning \u2014 earned loud applause by pledging to seek a \u201cno-kill\u201d policy for the city\u2019s shelters and by noting that she had helped pass laws that increased financing for animal care.         \n\n\u201cAs the owner of two shelter dogs, that\u2019s something I feel very deeply about moving toward,\u201d she said.         \n\nBut not every candidate was sure what to make of the issue. Sal F. Albanese, a former city councilman, appeared mystified as to why everybody was talking about animals in the first place.         \n\n\u201cBill says on the first day he\u2019s going to ban horse carriages,\u201d Mr. Albanese said. \u201cI\u2019m worried about creating jobs on my first day.\u201d         \n\nFor a cute, if disenfranchised, constituency, animals have long played an outsize role in the city\u2019s political process \u2014 sometimes as a heartstring-tugging front for moneyed municipal interests like real estate, labor, and big business.         \n\nThe attack ads against Ms. Quinn, for instance, were paid for in part by Steve Nislick, a wealthy parking garage magnate who founded an anti-horse-carriage group that has clashed with the Council speaker. The group recently began donating thousands of dollars to Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign.         \n\nMr. Nislick, whose wife has also contributed to Mr. de Blasio, joined forces with a labor group and Wendy Neu, a wealthy Manhattan businesswoman who is active in animal rights causes, to found the anti-Quinn coalition that bought the ad. The coalition has declined to disclose its full list of donors.         \n\nSome critics have suggested that Mr. Nislick wants to ban the carriages so he can buy the horse stables, which are on valuable land along Manhattan\u2019s West Side. A spokesman for Mr. Nislick said he had \u201cno interest in the stables whatsoever.\u201d         \n\nMs. Quinn, like her ally Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, has defended the Central Park carriages, saying they employ 300 people and are a valuable source of jobs at a time when unemployment remains stubbornly high. As speaker, she has sought to improve conditions for the horses by supporting the passage of a bill that requires bigger stalls and heavy blankets for the horses.         \n\nBut the carriages have already proved politically problematic for Ms. Quinn. Last year, she rebuked the industry after the tennis star Martina Navratilova complained that a carriage driver had used antigay and racist slurs, an incident captured on video. And Ms. Steinem, who this week endorsed Ms. Quinn for mayor, noted that the speaker\u2019s support for the carriage horse industry was a lingering area of disagreement between them.
