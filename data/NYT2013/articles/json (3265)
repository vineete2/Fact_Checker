{"headline": "Party Claims It Identified Top C.I.A. Spy in Pakistan", "body": "\nThe political party of the former cricket star Imran Khan on Wednesday identified a man it described as the C.I.A.'s top spy in Pakistan, in an escalation of Mr. Khan\u2019s campaign to end American drone strikes in the country.         \n\nIn a letter to the Pakistani police, Mr. Khan\u2019s information secretary, Shireen Mazari, accused the C.I.A. director, John O. Brennan, along with a man identified as the agency\u2019s Islamabad station chief, of \u201ccommitting murder and waging war against Pakistan.\u201d         \n\nIn Washington, a C.I.A. spokesman declined to comment on the case.         \n\nMs. Mazari demanded that the authorities prevent the station chief, whose identity has not yet been confirmed, from leaving the country so that he could face prosecution in a Pakistani court.         \n\nThat seems unlikely, but the move is expected to infuriate American officials, who had to recall a previous C.I.A. station chief in 2010 after he was identified in the local news media, also in relation to a legal suit brought by anti-drone campaigners.         \n\nBut while blame for that outing was placed on smoldering tensions between the C.I.A. and Pakistan\u2019s Inter-Services Intelligence spy agency, this time it appears to be driven more by Mr. Khan\u2019s increasingly confrontational stance against drone strikes.         \n\nIn an appearance on a television talk show on Wednesday evening, Mr. Khan said he had named the station chief essentially to punish the C.I.A. for a deadly drone strike this month in the province his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party controls, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. Now, he said, it was up to the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to take the next step against the American spy agency.         \n\nHe has vowed to block NATO supply lines into Afghanistan in retaliation for the Nov. 1 drone strike that  \n, Hakimullah Mehsud. On Saturday, his supporters moved to deliver on that promise by searching trucks and roughing up drivers as they passed through Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa on the way to Afghanistan.         \n\nIn her letter on Wednesday, Ms. Mazari claimed that the station chief did not enjoy diplomatic immunity, and suggested that if interrogated by the police he might divulge the names of the pilots who fly the drones.         \n\nThe high-profile attempt to obstruct C.I.A. operations in Pakistan was said to be a response to the Nov. 21 drone strike that  \n linked to the Haqqani network, a Taliban-affiliated militant group at the center of American security concerns in Afghanistan. The strike, which killed the Haqqanis\u2019 spiritual leader and five others, occurred in the Hangu district of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, in a rare drone strike outside Pakistan\u2019s tribal areas.         \n\nMr. Khan has been a leading advocate of ceasing military action against the Pakistani Taliban, even though Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa has been the region hardest hit by Islamist violence this year, with hundreds killed in attacks. The Taliban also broke out many prisoners in an embarrassing and well-organized jailbreak in July.         \n\nMr. Khan has used the drone issue to leverage his popularity against Mr. Sharif, who is his main electoral competitor in Punjab Province, and indeed has largely succeeded in framing the political debate on drones in recent years.         \n\nSome Sharif supporters criticized Mr. Khan for trying to score political points by outing the station chief. \u201cThis a thoughtless move,\u201d said Siddiqul Farooq, a central leader of the governing Pakistan Muslim League party. \u201cIt is selfish and compromises the national interest.\u201d         \n\nSince the escalation of the C.I.A.'s drone war in Pakistan in 2008, the Islamabad station has grown to become one of the spy agency\u2019s largest outposts in the world. The agency\u2019s expansion in Pakistan has been an irritant to America\u2019s relations with Pakistan.         \n\nThe influence of the C.I.A.'s Islamabad station chief has sometimes eclipsed even that of the American ambassador in Pakistan. A previous station chief clashed repeatedly in 2011 with Cameron Munter, the ambassador at the time, over the intensity of the drone campaign. The Obama administration ended up siding with the C.I.A., and Mr. Munter \u2014 citing personal reasons, not his disageements with the agency \u2014 left the country in 2012.
