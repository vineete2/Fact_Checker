{"headline": "Standoff at Western Wall Over Praying by Women", "body": "\nJERUSALEM \u2014 Thousands of ultra-Orthodox Jews tried to block a liberal women\u2019s group from praying at the Western Wall on Friday morning, creating a tense standoff in the latest flash point of a broader battle over religion and identity that has engulfed Israel.         \n\nHeeding calls from their rabbis, religious teenage girls turned up in large numbers to protest the group\u2019s insistence on praying at the wall in religious garb traditionally worn by men. The girls crammed the women\u2019s section directly in front of the wall by 6:30 a.m., forcing the liberal women to conduct their prayer service farther back on the plaza. There, hundreds of police officers locked arms in cordons to hold back throngs of black-hatted Orthodox men who whistled, catcalled, and threw water, candy and a few plastic chairs.         \n\nThe fight over how women pray at one of Judaism\u2019s holiest sites is a singular fault line among many. Friday\u2019s mass demonstration at the wall was widely seen as part of the intensifying culture war that poses a threat, if internal, to Israel\u2019s social cohesion.         \n\n\u201cWe are looking at a process in which the public disdain with the way religion and state matters have occurred in Israel has reached a peak,\u201d said Rabbi Uri Regev, the founder of Hiddush, a group that advocates for religious freedom and equality.         \n\nBut Rabbi Israel Eichler, an ultra-Orthodox member of Parliament, warned that \u201cif the state of Israel fights\u201d the ultra-Orthodox, in Hebrew called Haredim, \u201cit may win, but it will be erased from the face of the Earth.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThere were thousands of seminary girls there today,\u201d he said. \u201cEach one of them will have 10 children. That is our victory.\u201d         \n\nThe showdown on Friday came two days after  \n in buses, cemeteries, health clinics and radio airwaves, and as Parliament is drafting sweeping legislation to integrate the swelling ultra-Orthodox minority into the army and work force, while cutting back the subsidies their large families rely on. Following decades in which ultra-Orthodox politicians provided critical swing votes in exchange for control over religious institutions,  \n and have become an increasingly shrill part of the opposition.         \n\nMost Israelis care far less about the rules at the kotel, or Western Wall, a remnant of the retaining wall that surrounded the ancient Temple, than the ultra-Orthodox control of marriage, conversion and other matters that affect daily life.  \n wearing prayer shawls at the wall sparked an outcry from Jews abroad. That prompted Israel\u2019s government  \n that would provide a new space where men and women can pray together and as they wish.         \n\nBuoyed by the recent court ruling allowing them to use prayer garments traditionally reserved for men, the women\u2019s group, called Women of the Wall, has vowed to continue the monthly services it has held for a quarter century.         \n\nFriday was the first time ultra-Orthodox girls and women showed up in force to block them.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m here so they won\u2019t be,\u201d said one of the teenagers, who like a dozen others interviewed spoke on the condition that her name not be published. \u201cIt\u2019s forbidden for them to be here. It\u2019s allowed by the court, but it\u2019s forbidden by God. If I\u2019m here, there won\u2019t be room for them.\u201d         \n\nThe girls, who woke before dawn and poured onto buses from schools across Jerusalem as well as the the suburbs of Beit Shemesh and Beitar Illit, said they had come because their leaders ordered them to.         \n\nAmong the liberal women, a smaller-than-usual group of perhaps 100 made it to the Women of the Wall prayer circle, where much of the spirited chanting was drowned out by the boisterous men. Three of the men were arrested and two others detained for questioning.\u201d Every time, there\u2019s another stumbling block,\u201d said Haviva Ner David, a rabbi and mother of seven who has been praying with Women of the Wall for two decades. \u201cThere are more non-Orthodox Jews than there are Haredi Jews in Israel, but they\u2019re able to gather more troops.\u201d         \n\nAs the crowds dispersed, Yossi Parienti, commander of Jerusalem\u2019s police force, said it was \u201cpainful and a pity to see the Western Wall become a field of battle instead of a holy place of prayer.\u201d         \n\nRabbi Shmuel Rabinowitz, the head of the Western Wall Heritage Foundation \u2014 which controls the site \u2014 said, \u201cWe must find a solution that is acceptable to all, or to the majority, so that the Western Wall does not look as it did today.\u201d         \n\nThe heightened attention to the wall comes after  \n. Women have been barred from speaking at conferences, and an 8-year-old girl was spit on for dress that her ultra-Orthodox neighbors considered immodest. Vandals routinely black out women\u2019s faces on advertising billboards.         \n\nMenachem Friedman, a sociology professor at Bar Ilan University who has studied the Haredi society, said that while a universal military draft and cut in subsidies are more substantive issues, \u201cgender is the most vulnerable.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThe most threatening thing for the Haredi society is the mixture,\u201d Professor Friedman said. \u201cSex is always something we can\u2019t control \u2014 we have to defend against it, we have to separate, to make it very clear separation between men and women. Why? Because sex is really penetrating inside everyone, even the most sacred man is not protected. That is the main idea of ultra-Orthodoxy.\u201d         \n\nRuth Halperin-Kaddari, a law professor and director of the Rackman Center for the Advancement of the Status of Women at Bar Ilan University, said: \u201cWhat\u2019s at stake here is the very characteristic of the state of Israel. Are we part of the Western world or are we part of the fundamentalist world?\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/11/world/middleeast/3-ultra-orthodox-men-arrested-in-western-wall-standoff.html", "date": "2013-05-10", "description": "Thousands of ultra-Orthodox Jews joined a protest at the Jerusalem holy site, creating a standoff with a group of women praying there in garments traditionally worn by men."}
