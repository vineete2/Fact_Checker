{"headline": "A New Way to Care for Young Brains", "body": "\nBOSTON \u2014 The drumbeat of alarming stories linking concussions among football players and other athletes to brain disease has led to a new and mushrooming American phenomenon: the specialized youth sports concussion clinic, which one day may be as common as a mall at the edge of town.         \n\nIn the last three years, dozens of youth concussion clinics have opened in nearly 35 states \u2014 outpatient centers often connected to large hospitals that are now filled with young athletes complaining of headaches, amnesia, dizziness or problems concentrating. The proliferation of clinics, however, comes at a time when there is still no agreed-upon, established formula for treating the injuries.         \n\n\u201cIt is inexact, a science in its infancy,\u201d said Dr. Michael O\u2019Brien of the sports concussion clinic at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital. \u201cWe know much more than we once did, but there are lots of layers we still need to figure out.\u201d         \n\nDeep concern among parents about the effects of concussions is colliding with the imprecise understanding of the injury. To families whose anxiety has been stoked by reports of former N.F.L. players with degenerative brain disease, the new facilities are seen as the most expert care available. That has parents parading to the clinic waiting rooms.         \n\nThe trend is playing out vividly in Boston, where the phone hardly stops ringing at the youth sports concussion clinic at  \n.         \n\n\u201cParents call saying, \u2018I saw a scary report about concussions on Oprah or on the \u2018Doctors\u2019 show or Katie Couric\u2019s show,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Dr. Barbara Semakula said, describing a typical day at the clinic. \u201cTheir child just hurt his head, and they\u2019ve already leapt to the worst possible scenarios. It\u2019s a little bit of a frenzy out there.\u201d         \n\nAbout three miles away, at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, patient visits per month to its sports concussion clinic have increased more than fifteenfold in the last five years, to 400 from 25. The clinic, which once consisted of two consultation rooms, now employs nine doctors at four locations and operates six days a week.         \n\n\u201cIt used to be a completely different scene, with a child\u2019s father walking in reluctantly to tell us, \u2018He\u2019s fine; this concussion stuff is nonsense,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Dr. William Meehan, a clinic co-founder. \u201cIt\u2019s totally the opposite now. A kid has one concussion, and the parents are very worried about how he\u2019ll be functioning at 50 years old.\u201d         \n\nDoctors nationwide say the new focus on the dangers of concussions is long overdue. Concerned parents are properly seeking better care, which has saved and improved lives. But a confluence of outside forces has also spawned a mania of sorts that has turned the once-ignored concussion into the paramount medical fear of young athletes across the country.         \n\nMost prominent have been news media reports about scores of relatively young former professional athletes reporting serious cognitive problems and other later-life illnesses. Several ex-N.F.L. players who have committed suicide, most notably Junior Seau, a former San Diego Chargers and New England Patriots star, have been found posthumously to have had a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated head trauma.         \n\nState legislatures have commanded the attention of families as well, with 43 states passing laws requiring school-age athletes who have sustained a concussion to have written authorization from a medical professional, often one trained in concussion management, before they can return to their sport.         \n\nThe two Boston clinics, one started in 2007 and the other in 2011, are typical examples of the concussion clinic phenomenon, busy centers of a new branch of American health care and windows into the crux of a mounting youth sports fixation.         \n\n\u201cWe are really in the trenches of a new medical experience,\u201d said Richard Ginsburg, the director of psychological services at Massachusetts General Hospital\u2019s youth sports concussion clinic. \u201cFirst of all, there\u2019s some hysteria, so a big part of our job is to educate people that 90 percent of concussions are resolved in a month, if not sooner. As for the other 10 percent of patients, they need somewhere to go.         \n\n\u201cSo we see them. We see it all.\u201d         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/06/sports/concussion-fears-lead-to-growth-in-specialized-clinics-for-young-athletes.html", "date": "2013-05-05", "description": "Doctors are pleased that the dangers of concussions are receiving more attention, but they often see overreactions from parents alarmed by high-profile cases."}
