{"headline": "Making Christmas Sweet", "body": "\nPARIS \u2014 A large flat box arrived by messenger the other day from  \n, the French chef with 17 Michelin stars. It contained six disks of chocolate studded with nuts and dried fruits; a chocolate base, pole and triangular crown; a pair of white cotton knit gloves, and instructions on how to turn the chocolate pieces into a  \n.         \n\nThis is the season when France celebrates chocolate, its fail-safe, last-minute, all-purpose, ever-elegant gift. Every December, just about every restaurant chef, pastry chef and bonbon-maker feels compelled to do something \u2014 simple, spectacular or silly \u2014 with the substance.         \n\n \n, the Paris chocolatier, has transformed the b\u00fbche de No\u00ebl, the traditional spongecake bound with chocolate butter cream and shaped like a yule log, to look like a two-volume antique book set. It is made with six different chocolates and includes a chocolate biscuit as a base, a Tanzanian chocolate mousse, a Peruvian chocolate cream filling and nougat puffed rice. The hard chocolate casing is decorated with gold lettering. The cake is gluten free. It costs more than $100.         \n\nThe French national train service covered a railway car in chocolate brown in November and sent it from station to station in Paris. Visitors were invited to view an exhibition inside the car explaining the steps in chocolate-making. They were offered samples and the chance to buy dark and milk chocolates made by Yves Thuri\u00e8s, a two-time winner of the \u201cbest artisan of France\u201d prize.         \n\nThe Galeries Lafayette department store sent some of France\u2019s leading chocolate makers up and down its aisles to hand out samples last month, and the designer chocolatier  \n is running a hot chocolate bar on its rooftop terrace until the end of December.  \n is offering a \u201climited edition\u201d handcrafted sculpture called \u201cA Midwinter Night\u2019s Dream\u201d in dark, milk and white chocolate, studded with nuts, dried fruits and roasted cocoa beans; it moves when a gearwheel is turned.         \n\nThe challenge for French consumers is deciding which chocolate is best. But two trends have complicated that choice.         \n\nFirst, over the last three decades, chocolate here has gone wildly upscale, just as it has in the United States and around the world. Serious chocolate lovers discuss prestige bars with the same passion, standards and vocabulary that they use to describe fine wines: they talk of soil composition, vintages, house blends, grands crus.         \n\nYet in a curiously contrary move, the craft of French chocolate-making has been degraded. In 2003, the European Union ruled that chocolate makers may replace up to 5 percent of the cocoa butter in their products with vegetable fats and still call the result chocolate. Connoisseurs picketed European Union offices, to no avail, while big chocolate makers celebrated; they could churn out a lot more chocolate for a lot less money.         \n\nThe best industrial French chocolate maker is  \n, based in Tain-l\u2019Hermitage, a small town near Lyon. The top chefs in Paris \u2014 from the young, hip Amandine Chaignot, at  \n, to the prizewinning pastry chef and chocolate maker S\u00e9bastien Gaudard \u2014 swear by the company because its quality and distribution system are excellent. Purists mourn what they call its sellout: founded in 1922 by a French pastry chef, Alb\u00e9ric Guironnet, Valrhona was bought in 1984 by the French milk giant Groupe Soparind Bongrain.         \n\nEnter Mr. Ducasse, who wanted to try his hand at artisanal chocolate-making. He is celebrating his first  \n season as a bean-to-bar chocolatier.         \n\nAbout five years ago, he began scouring Europe to find old-fashioned bean roasters and chocolate-making machines. He sent Nicolas Berger, his longtime pastry chef, off to Lyon for some quick training in roasting and candy-making. He transformed a former car repair shop near the Place de la Bastille here into a modernistic glass-and-steel chocolate-making factory, showroom and retail store.         \n\nMr. Ducasse has been praised lavishly in the French media for venturing into new culinary territory by making chocolate the hard way, from scratch. Little, though, has been said about the product.         \n\nWhen Mr. Ducasse\u2019s chocolate tree-to-be arrived at my house, along with other samples from his chocolate operation, I invited three friends for an informal tasting. A food critic brought three old-fashioned-looking chocolate bars by Bonnat, a small establishment in the heart of France that was founded in 1884 and claims to be the oldest family-run \u201cchocolaterie\u201d in the world.         \n\nMaybe it was the effect of the Sauternes we opened to accompany it, but we all agreed that Bonnat\u2019s Apotequil, a 75-percent-cacao bar, was the best chocolate we had ever eaten.         \n\nSo I decided to call on St\u00e9phane Bonnat in Voiron, a small village outside Grenoble in the foothills of the Alps.
