{"headline": "Jimmy Connors, Ladies\u2019 Man", "body": "\nTechnically, Jimmy Connors wasn\u2019t the most overwhelming player. He was on the slight side; his serve was so-so, his forehand questionable. His only truly great stroke was his two-handed backhand. That he managed to win eight Grand Slam events (five U.S. Opens, two Wimbledons and one Australian Open), spend 160 consecutive weeks at No. 1 (1974-77) and rack up a record 109 career singles titles (John McEnroe and Roger Federer each have 77; Rafael Nadal has 58) is a testament, in large part, to a relentless and, at times, all-consuming will. This trait goes a long way toward explaining Connors\u2019s most quietly astounding feat: for 16 years, he held a Top 10 ranking. In an era when tennis careers can flame out over a half-dozen seasons, Connors \u2014 who on his 39th birthday won a fourth-round U.S. Open match against the 24-year-old Aaron Krickstein in 4 hours 41 minutes \u2014 looks, in retrospect, more and more like a freak of nature or nurture or both.         \n\nA blue-collar kid from Belleville, Ill., Connors, who is now 60, joined the men\u2019s tour as the sport was shaking its country-club gentility. He strutted combatively; he pointed fingers. His displays often crossed the bounds of good taste \u2014 he knew better than anyone how to exploit the phallic possibilities of a racket \u2014 but that was decades ago. Since then, his demons have quieted; what endures is his incomparable tennis intelligence. Last month, Connors, who was mentored on the court by both his mother and grandmother, was hired to pass some of that aptitude to Maria Sharapova, currently the No. 3 women\u2019s player in the world, who seemed to have confronted an impenetrable barrier in the form of her nemesis, Serena Williams. (Williams has won 14 of their 16 matches.)         \n\nWell, it didn\u2019t quite work out that way. Sharapova lost her first match as a Connors disciple at the Western & Southern Open, a tuneup for the U.S. Open. Afterward Connors tweeted, \u201cEvery good round starts with a bogey \u2014 not the start we wanted, so back to work tomorrow.\u201d But by the end of the week, the partnership was over after only 34 days. (As it turns out, Sharapova pulled out of the Open this week.) This article is the result of several conversations, which have been condensed and edited, from before and after the short-lived experiment with Sharapova. Connors, showing a side of himself that no one who watched him in his prime would recognize, tweeted from Santa Barbara, Calif., a few days after the loss: \u201cBack home in SB \u2014 family, pups, and home cooking. Oh \u2014 I forgot, and a vodka on the rocks.\u201d         \n\n \nSharapova has achieved a tremendous amount \u2014 four Grand Slam victories \u2014 and yet appears to have hit a wall with Serena Williams. I guess you wouldn\u2019t have signed on unless you felt that wall was breakable.         \n\n \n There comes a point with a lot of top players when they look for someone who can see something that can maybe get them over the hump. I worked with [the former player and coach] Pancho Segura when I was young, then I sought him out again when I had a bit of a career stall in the late \u201970s. With somebody who has Maria\u2019s credentials, it\u2019s not major surgery. I guess the challenge is just to find that one little tweak that she grabs onto \u2014 that one little extra thing that she\u2019s looking for. Because she\u2019s not missing anything, let\u2019s face it. Coaching her is an opportunity that came along to me when I wasn\u2019t looking to work, really.         \n\n \n How long have you known her?         \n\n \nWe spent a little time together before she went down to Australia and won in 2008. So we\u2019ve been friends for five, six years. I always enjoyed watching her \u2014 I like the way she goes about things. She has that attitude that I like.         \n\n \nWhat kind of attitude?         \n\n \nI like seeing in somebody just what it means to them \u2014 what they\u2019re willing to lay out there to try to be the best. Some players have it in practice, but it doesn\u2019t catch. But it catches with Maria. She\u2019s willing to lay it all out there in practice, and she\u2019s not afraid to do that when she plays her matches, too. That\u2019s pretty special to see.         \n\n \n Your partnership ended abruptly after she lost her first match at a U.S. Open tuneup in Cincinnati. What happened?         \n\n \n No comment.         \n\n \n Were you surprised?         \n\n \n I was just told my services were no longer needed. I wish her all the best, and I\u2019ll always be a fan. Whenever this happens, it\u2019s mutual.         \n\n \n So was this a mutual decision?         \n\n \n It\u2019s her decision for sure. She\u2019s the player, not me.         \n\n \n Is this the downside of trying to work with a player who has already accomplished so much?         \n\n \n I guess it depends on what you\u2019re looking for. Taking someone from No. 2 to No. 1 \u2014 there\u2019s a lot less room.         \n\n \n Do you think what happened reflects the pressure it takes to be No. 1?
