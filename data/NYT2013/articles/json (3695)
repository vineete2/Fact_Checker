{"headline": "Looking Past Sex Scandal, South Carolina Returns Ex-Governor to Congress", "body": "\nMOUNT PLEASANT, S.C. \u2014 As political rehabilitations go, few can match what happened to Mark Sanford on Tuesday night.         \n\nMr. Sanford, the former South Carolina governor once so tarnished by a spectacular lie about an affair that few expected him to recover, is now headed to Congress.         \n\nAbout 55 percent of voters in South Carolina\u2019s First Congressional District forgave the man who turned \u201chiking the Appalachian Trail\u201d into a euphemism for infidelity, giving him a nearly 10-percentage-point win over his Democratic opponent, Elizabeth Colbert Busch.         \n\nIn his victory speech, Mr. Sanford promised to be a \u201cmessenger to Washington, D.C.\u201d Then, after introducing one of his sons and his fianc\u00e9e, Mari\u00e1 Bel\u00e9n Chapur, who had just flown in from Argentina, he spoke of the redemption he had found on the campaign trail.         \n\n\u201cI am an imperfect man saved by God\u2019s grace,\u201d he said.         \n\nFor voters, his hawkish views on federal spending, his experience and his promise to fight President Obama outweighed any personal transgressions.         \n\n\u201cHe took a couple of years to reflect, and now he just wants to get back to work,\u201d said Tom Lewis, 47, a Sanford voter who considers himself a libertarian. \u201cThey\u2019ve just got to reel it in in Washington.\u201d         \n\nStill, even until the last moments of voting, it appeared that Ms. Colbert Busch, a political neophyte, stood a solid chance of becoming the first Democrat this conservative coastal district would send to the House in more than 30 years.         \n\nNot only did she have nearly $1 million in financing from the national Democratic Party and fund-raisers hosted by her famous brother, the comedian Stephen Colbert, but she also had the support of women who might have otherwise voted Republican.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m still not sure I know exactly what she believes in, but integrity matters more than anything to me,\u201d said Suzanne McCord, 53, a conservative who had never before voted for a Democrat but found Mr. Sanford\u2019s behavior too distasteful to forgive with her vote.         \n\nIn the end, however, government spending beat out a messy personal life.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of problems with Sanford, believe me,\u201d said Jennifer Kavanagh, 42, a real estate agent. \u201cI\u2019d have preferred to have another Republican, but I just don\u2019t agree with the way Democrats are spending.\u201d         \n\nThe race, soaked in personal drama that many have found similar to \u2014 and even more engaging than \u2014 reality television, received enormous media attention.         \n\nIn 2009, Mr. Sanford had appeared to commit professional suicide by covering up a trip to Argentina to pursue the woman he would later call his soul mate with a story about hiking the Appalachian Trail.         \n\nHis wife, Jenny Sanford, divorced him, and he faced impeachment before limping through the end of his term in 2011.         \n\nMr. Sanford\u2019s political comeback could have been crafted only by a veteran, as Mr. Sanford is. He has never lost an election, and from 1995 to 2001, he held the House seat he just won, back then riding a wave of Republican power led by Newt Gingrich and articulated by the party\u2019s Contract With America.         \n\nThe seat opened up in December when Gov. Nikki R. Haley appointed Representative Tim Scott, a favorite of the Tea Party, to replace Jim DeMint in the Senate. Mr. DeMint had stepped down to run the Heritage Foundation.         \n\nMr. Sanford, who will have to run again in 2014 to keep the seat, easily won in a crowded primary field in March. Still, it was never clear that he could overcome his transgressions, even though the district is populated with country club Republicans and more conservative Tea Party voters.         \n\nAnd then there was his opponent, a sympathetic woman roughly the age of Jenny Sanford with a famous brother, a compelling personal story as a single mother and a long track record as an executive in the maritime industry.         \n\nShe was popular among the more centrist residents of Charleston County, which had supported President Obama twice but handed the victory to Mr. Sanford by less than two percentage points.         \n\n\u201cWe gave it a heck of a fight,\u201d she said in her concession speech.         \n\nThroughout the campaign, she tried to invoke the word \u201ctrust\u201d with regularity, but remained vague on issues and scant on public appearances that were not heavily orchestrated.         \n\nIn April, leaked court documents revealed that Mr. Sanford\u2019s ex-wife claimed that he had been in her house watching the Super Bowl with one of their sons in violation of the divorce agreement. (The two will head back to court on Thursday to resolve the issue.)         \n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee pulled its support of Mr. Sanford while national Democratic organizations poured money into Ms. Colbert Busch\u2019s campaign.         \n\nOn Sunday, Ms. Colbert Busch received a key endorsement from The Post and Courier of Charleston, the largest newspaper in the area. Several Republican women stepped firmly into her camp, including members of Congress.         \n\nBut Mr. Sanford turned the race into a battle against Washington Democratic power brokers, especially the former House speaker Nancy Pelosi.         \n\nTuesday\u2019s vote proved that his approach worked.         \n\nMr. Sanford received support from local Republicans, including Governor Haley, although some of it was tepid. Senator Lindsey Graham, a fellow Republican, had been more vocal, portraying the race as a statement against President Obama.         \n\nMr. Sanford received, but declined, an endorsement and the offer of financial support from Larry Flynt, the pornography advocate, who called Mr. Sanford \u201cAmerica\u2019s great sex pioneer.\u201d         \n\nBut in the end, people here cared less about sex and more about government spending.         \n\n\u201cWe are not trying to elect the \u2018how is your conscience\u2019 candidate,\u201d said Charm Altman, president of the South Carolina Federation of Republican Women. \u201cWe are trying to elect someone who can govern.\u201d         \n\nBrad Mallett, 45, a local coffee roaster who was at Mr. Sanford\u2019s packed victory party, put it more simply: \u201cEveryone deserves a second chance.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/08/us/south-carolina-election-a-referendum-on-sanford.html", "date": "2013-05-07", "description": "The former governor of South Carolina, Mark Sanford, whose political career seemed over after an extramarital affair, was elected to the same Congressional seat he previously held."}
