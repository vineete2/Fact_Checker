That early detour can be costly, leading many to drop out, often in heavy debt and with diminished prospects of finding a job.         \n\nMeanwhile, shrinking state budgets have taken a heavy toll at public institutions, reducing the number of seats available in classes students must take to graduate. In California alone, higher education cuts have left hundreds of thousands of college students without access to classes they need.         \n\nTo address both problems and keep students on track to graduation, universities are beginning to experiment with adding the new \u201cmassive open online courses,\u201d created to deliver elite college instruction to anyone with an Internet connection, to their offerings.         \n\nWhile the courses, known as MOOCs, have enrolled millions of students around the world, most who enroll never start a single assignment, and very few complete the courses. So to reach students who are not ready for college-level work, or struggling with introductory courses, universities are beginning to add extra supports to the online materials, in hopes of improving success rates.         \n\nHere at San Jose State, for example, two pilot programs weave material from the online classes into the instructional mix and allow students to earn credit for them.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in Silicon Valley, we breathe that entrepreneurial air, so it makes sense that we are the first university to try this,\u201d said  \n, the university\u2019s president. \u201cIn academia, people are scared to fail, but we know that innovation always comes with the possibility of failure. And if it doesn\u2019t work the first time, we\u2019ll figure out what went wrong and do better.\u201d         \n\nIn one pilot program, the university is working with  \n, a company co-founded by a Stanford professor, to see whether round-the-clock online mentors, hired and trained by the company, can help more students make their way through three fully online basic math courses.         \n\nThe tiny for-credit pilot courses, open to both San Jose State students and local high school and community college students, began in January, so it is too early to draw any conclusions. But early signs are promising, so this summer, Udacity and San Jose State are expanding those classes to 1,000 students, and adding new courses in psychology and computer programming, with tuition of only $150 a course.         \n\nSan Jose State has already achieved remarkable results with online materials from  \n, a nonprofit online provider, in its circuits course, a longstanding hurdle for would-be engineers. Usually, two of every five students earn a grade below C and must retake the course or change career plans. So last spring, Ellen Junn, the provost, visited Anant Agarwal, an M.I.T. professor who taught a free online version of the circuits class, to ask whether San Jose State could become a living lab for his course, the first offering from edX, an online collaboration of Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.         \n\nDr. Junn hoped that blending M.I.T.'s online materials with live classroom sessions might help more students succeed. Dr. Agarwal, the president of edX, agreed enthusiastically, and without any formal agreement or exchange of money, he arranged for San Jose State to offer the blended class last fall.         \n\nThe results were striking: 91 percent of those in the blended section passed, compared with 59 percent in the traditional class.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re engineers, and we check our results, but if this semester is similar, we will not have the traditional version next year,\u201d said Khosrow Ghadiri, who teaches the blended class. \u201cIt would be educational malpractice.\u201d         \n\nIt is hard to say, though, how much the improved results come from the edX online materials, and how much from the shift to classroom sessions focusing on small group projects, rather than lectures.         \n\nFinding better ways to move students through the start of college is crucial, said Josh Jarrett, a higher education officer at the  \n, which in the past year has given grants to develop massive open online courses for basic and remedial courses.
