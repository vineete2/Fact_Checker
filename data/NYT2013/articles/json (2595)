{"headline": "Death Penalty for Rampage at Fort Hood", "body": "\nKILLEEN, Tex. \u2014 Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, the Army psychiatrist who admitted to killing 13 unarmed people at Fort Hood nearly four years ago, was sentenced to death by lethal injection by a jury on Wednesday, becoming one of only a handful of men on military death row.         \n\nSince the case against Major Hasan was overwhelming, his conviction was a near certainty, and the main question in the trial was whether he would receive the death penalty.         \n\nProsecutors had from the start built a case for execution for an attack that a Senate report called the worst act of terrorism on American soil since Sept. 11, 2001. But Major Hasan, a Muslim, taunted the military justice system, refusing to put up a defense and suggesting in and out of court that death to him was but a means to martyrdom, leaving jurors to ponder whether to give him what he wanted.         \n\nHis stance left the Army\u2019s lead prosecutor, Col. Michael Mulligan, telling jurors during his closing argument on Wednesday morning that Major Hasan was not and never would be a martyr.         \n\n\u201cDo not be fooled,\u201d he told the 13 senior Army officers on the panel. \u201cHe is not giving his life. We are taking his life. This is not his gift to God. This is his debt to society.\u201d         \n\nThe jurors took a little more than two hours to decide on the sentence. If even one of them had objected to Major Hasan\u2019s execution, he would have been sentenced to life in prison. The same jury on Friday  \n of 45 counts of murder and attempted murder.         \n\nBecause of the high profile and heavy toll of the Nov. 5, 2009, attack \u2014 more than 40 people were killed or wounded \u2014 Major Hasan is likely to become the first American soldier in more than half a century to be executed in the military\u2019s death chamber at Fort Leavenworth, Kan. The execution would require presidential approval.         \n\nDriven, he said, by a hatred of American military action in the Muslim world and a desire to protect Taliban leaders in Afghanistan, Major Hasan turned on troops wearing the same camouflage uniform as his own, using those green fatigues and his laser-sighted semiautomatic pistol to target soldiers but avoid civilians. Firing 146 rounds at men and women as they crawled on the floor or crouched behind desks and cubicles, he killed 12 soldiers and a civilian who lunged at him with a chair.         \n\nInside a Fort Hood courtroom fortified with blast-resistant barriers, Major Hasan showed no emotion as the jury forewoman read the sentence.         \n\nOther death sentences have been handed down by juries in military courts in recent years \u2014 Hasan Akbar, the Army sergeant convicted of a grenade attack on his own camp in Kuwait, received one in 2005 \u2014 but experts in military law said Major Hasan\u2019s case was unique because of the enormity of the crime, the likelihood of presidential approval of an execution and his decision to act as his own lawyer.         \n\nMajor Hasan was the first defendant to represent himself in a military capital-punishment case in modern times, raising a host of issues. One of them is the conflict between his right to self-representation and the requirement that death penalty defendants be given special protections to ensure a fair verdict and sentence.         \n\nSome military legal experts suggested that Major Hasan\u2019s case \u2014 in which he became a nonparticipant at his own trial and sought the death sentence \u2014 represented a fundamental breakdown of the military justice system. Others disputed that assertion.         \n\nMajor Hasan was found competent to stand trial, and the judge, Col. Tara A. Osborn, who repeatedly told him it was unwise to proceed on his own, said his right to represent himself allowed him to be, as she put it, \u201cthe captain of his own ship.\u201d         \n\nMajor Hasan admitted to the jury in his opening statement that he was the gunman. He asked few questions, made few objections to testimony and entered one exhibit into evidence. He made no closing argument.         \n\nHis entire sentencing case amounted to three words: \u201cThe defense rests.\u201d         \n\nMajor Hasan\u2019s former Army defense lawyers had asked the judge to allow them to put on a sentencing defense over his objections. They planned on calling 59 witnesses and presenting evidence to counter prosecutors\u2019 portrayal of him. In a motion filed with the judge, they also argued that enemies of the United States might use a Muslim \u201cmartyr-in-waiting\u201d to inspire other attacks. The judge denied their request.
