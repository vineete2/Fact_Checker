{"headline": "South Korea Flirts With Nuclear Ideas as North Blusters", "body": "\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 As their country prospered, South Koreans have largely shrugged off the constant threat of a North Korean attack. But breakthroughs in the North\u2019s missile and nuclear programs and fiery threats of war have heightened fears in the South that even small miscalculations by the new and untested leaders of each country could have disastrous consequences.         \n\nNow this new sense of vulnerability is causing some influential South Koreans to break a decades-old taboo by openly calling for the South to develop its own nuclear arsenal, a move that would raise the stakes in what is already one of the world\u2019s most militarized regions.         \n\nWhile few here think this will happen anytime soon, two recent opinion polls show that two-thirds of South Koreans support the idea posed by a small but growing number of politicians and columnists \u2014 a reflection, analysts say, of hardening attitudes since  \n\u2019s Feb. 12 underground nuclear test, its third since 2006.         \n\n\u201cThe third nuclear test was for South Korea what the  \n was for the U.S.,\u201d said Han Yong-sup, a professor of security policy at the Korea National Defense University in Seoul. \u201cIt has made the North Korean threat seem very close and very real.\u201d         \n\nIn recent weeks, the North has approached a crucial threshold with its weapons programs, with the successful launching of a long-range rocket, followed by the test detonation of a nuclear device that could be small enough to fit on top of a rocket. Those advances were followed by a barrage of apocalyptic threats to rain \u201cpre-emptive nuclear strikes\u201d and \u201cfinal destruction\u201d on Seoul, the South\u2019s neon-drenched capital. The intensification of North Korea\u2019s typically bellicose language shocked many South Koreans, who had thought the main target of the North\u2019s nuclear program was the United States.         \n\nAdding to South Koreans\u2019 worries, the North and its nuclear arsenal are in the hands of a young new leader, Kim Jong-un, whose brinkmanship appears to be an effort to ensure the support of his nation\u2019s powerful military.         \n\nThe South also has a new president, Park Geun-hye, the daughter of a military strongman who stood firm against North Korea, who herself also faces pressure to stand fast against the North. Just two weeks after her inauguration, Ms. Park faces a crisis as the North makes vague threats interpreted by many South Koreans as the precursor to some sort of limited, conventional military provocation. Ms. Park has promised to retaliate if her nation is attacked, aware of the public anger directed at her predecessor, Lee Myung-bak, when he showed restraint after the North shelled a South Korean island in 2010, killing four people.         \n\nThat kind of limited skirmish is more likely than a nuclear attack, but such an episode could quickly inflame tensions and escalate out of control. Over the years, North Korea has sent armed spies across the border, dug invasion tunnels under it and infiltrated South Korean waters with submarines.         \n\nBut beyond the immediate fear of a military provocation, analysts say deeper anxieties are also at work in the South. One of the biggest is the creeping resurgence of old fears about the reliability of this nation\u2019s longtime protector, the United States. Experts say the talk of South Korea\u2019s acquiring  \n is an oblique way to voice the concerns of a small but growing number of South Koreans that the United States, either because of budget cuts or a lack of will, may one day no longer act as the South\u2019s ultimate insurance policy.         \n\n\u201cThe Americans don\u2019t feel the North Korean nuclear weapons as a direct threat,\u201d said Chung Mong-joon, a son of the founder of the Hyundai industrial group and the former leader of the governing party, who has been the leading proponent of South Korea\u2019s development of a nuclear weapons program. \u201cAt a time of crisis, we are not 100 percent sure whether the Americans will cover us with its nuclear umbrella.\u201d         \n\nThe United States, which still has 28,500 troops based in South Korea, has sought to assure its ally that it remains committed to the region as part of the Obama administration\u2019s strategic \u201cpivot\u201d to Asia. But analysts say the fact that senior leaders like Mr. Chung and a handful of influential newspaper columnists now call for the need for \u201cnuclear deterrence,\u201d or at least hint at it, reflects widespread frustrations over the inability of the United States and other nations to end  \n program. Until recently the idea was too radical for most mainstream leaders and opinion makers, including both deeply pro-American conservatives and nationalistic yet antinuclear liberals.         \n\nAdvocacy for a nuclear-armed South Korea has been virtually taboo since the early 1970s, when the country\u2019s military dictator, Park Chung-hee, made a serious bid to develop a nuclear weapon, fearing that the United States might pull out of Asia after its defeat in Vietnam. After catching wind of the program, Washington forced Mr. Park, the new president\u2019s father, to stop, persuading him instead to rely on the United States, an agreement that has held ever since.
