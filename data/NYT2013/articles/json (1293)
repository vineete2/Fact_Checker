{"headline": "Turks Debate Modest Dress Set for Takeoff", "body": "\nISTANBUL \u2014 When flight attendants first rode aboard  \n in the late 1940s they wore cotton blouses under blue suits tailored to accentuate \u201cthe contours of the body,\u201d as a fashion history of the airline puts it. In the \u201960s and \u201970s the trend continued with fashions straight off the Paris runway, designed to show  \n\u2019s European flair on its flagship airline.         \n\nNow, the country\u2019s shifting mores are reflected in a proposed  \n: long dresses, skirts below the knee and Ottoman-style fez caps.         \n\nThis being Turkey, where seemingly trifling matters can become bitter contests over identity, mock-ups leaked to the news media have caused quite a stir, eliciting passionate reactions from the secular and the pious, and from those who support the traditions of modern Turkey and others who are nostalgic for the days of the Ottoman Empire.         \n\nOn Twitter, some Turks mocked the new uniforms as reminiscent of the costumes worn in \u201cMagnificent Century,\u201d a popular  \n about the decadent reign of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent in the 16th century. The dispute was only heightened after the airline said it was banning alcohol on some domestic and international flights.         \n\nOthers slammed the new look as too conservative, a transparent effort to please the Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party headed by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The party\u2019s decade-long run in power has wrought changes in the traditionally secular culture, like the acceptance of Islamic head scarves in public and on college campuses and restrictions on alcohol in certain places.         \n\n\u201cIt is a reaction against imposing a certain lifestyle to all institutions in Turkey,\u201d said Ayse Saktanber, a sociologist at the Middle East Technical University in Ankara. \u201cTurkey is a pragmatic society which doesn\u2019t like to fall behind the world. These new costumes came with the alcohol ban on planes.\u201d         \n\nShe added, \u201ceven my students with head scarves find these ridiculous.\u201d         \n\nIn a statement to the local news media, Turkish Airlines tried to mute the uproar, saying that the design was leaked prematurely and that it is just one option among many being considered. \u201cAmong those that reinterpret traditional Turkish designs, there are also others that stick out with their modernist approach.\u201d         \n\nThat Turkish Airlines has now become a locus of the country\u2019s culture wars is perhaps not surprising, given that the airline is considered something of a national treasure by many Turks. This is particularly true of secularists, who see it as presenting the face of Turkey to the world. They recall that it was founded under Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the father of modern Turkey who instituted secularism with an iron hand and banned the fez, among other symbols of Ottoman times.         \n\nWith Turkey\u2019s rise as an economic and political power over the past decade, tourism has soared. Feeding some of the backlash against the new uniforms is the fear that tourists, many of whom form their first impressions of Turkey on a Turkish Airlines flight, will get the wrong impression. And for all the talk of Turkey pivoting from the West and becoming a new leader of the Muslim world, the flight schedules tell a different narrative: in January nearly four times as many passengers flew to Europe as to the Middle East.         \n\nSome feel that Turkish Airlines, nearly 50-percent-owned by the government, is simply trying to please Mr. Erdogan, who, when he is not being accused by his opponents of being a strict Islamist, is referred to as a latter-day sultan for his accrual of power.         \n\n\u201cTurkish Airlines is leaning toward a more conservative line,\u201d said Serdar Tasci, a sociologist who also works as a consultant to the main secular political party, the Republican People\u2019s Party, or C.H.P. \u201cOn the one hand it is trying to be a global brand, and on the other it is allying with the neoconservative policies of the political power.\u201d         \n\nIn a written statement, the chairman of Turkish Airlines\u2019 board of directors did not deny that the airline was doing the government\u2019s bidding. In fact, he adamantly confirmed it. \u201cThe Turkish Airlines vision matches with our government\u2019s vision,\u201d said the chairman, Hamdi Topcu. \u201cThere is no difference between them and us. It is the government that appointed us.\u201d         \n\nHe added, \u201cThe Turkish Republic\u2019s government, which came to power with democratic elections and gained the confidence of its people, represents this country\u2019s values.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/25/world/europe/new-uniforms-for-turkish-airlines-create-uproar.html", "date": "2013-02-24", "description": "Proposed new uniforms for Turkish Airlines flight attendants, including long dresses and Ottoman-style fez caps, have created an uproar over how the flagship carrier should be perceived."}
