{"headline": "Who Made That Super Soaker?", "body": "\nIt was a \u201cclassic situation\u201d for an inventor, says Lonnie Johnson of the moment in 1989 when he waited nervously for a meeting with toy executives at Larami, a pink Samsonite suitcase on his lap. Inside the suitcase was a new kind of water gun. Instead of a pistol that piddled out a thin stream, this toy was engineered to spray water dozens of feet. \u201cI had bought a milling machine and made all of the parts myself out of PVC pipe and Plexiglas,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cEven the valves \u2014 I made those too.\u201d         \n\nJohnson had worked on bigger projects. He was a senior systems engineer on the Galileo mission to Jupiter, based at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, Calif. But he still worried about how his invention would go over. As an African-American in a field in which minorities were rare, he was often underestimated, he says. \u201cMost of my career as an engineer, I was put in environments where I was the only person of color in the room.\u201d         \n\nJohnson knew that the toy industry could be fickle. \u201cIt\u2019s like the entertainment industry. You can\u2019t predict whether a song is going to be a hit and how everyone will react to it.\u201d When he finally stepped into the conference room, Johnson didn\u2019t say much. Instead, he opened up his suitcase and pulled out a water gun, with a cartoonish plastic bulb mounted on top, that looked like a prop from \u201cPlan 9 From Outer Space.\u201d         \n\n\u201cDoes it work?\u201d Myung Song, the company president, wanted to know. Johnson pumped the gun and pulled the trigger. Water blasted across the room and splatted against the far wall. There was a stunned silence. \u201cWow,\u201d Song said.         \n\n\u201cAt that point, I knew I had captured their imagination,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cThey could see what I had seen in the water gun all along.\u201d The Super Soaker went on to become one of the top-selling toys of the early \u201990s.         \n\nThese days, Johnson has left toys behind to concentrate on solving a more urgent problem: \u201cEnergy \u2018R\u2019 Us,\u201d he says. With scientists at Tulane and Tuskegee universities, he is working on a method for transforming heat into electricity. He hopes that his technology will revolutionize solar-power panels and make green energy more affordable. \u201cMy goal,\u201d he says, \u201cis to get this to market as soon as I can.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n\u00a0In the early 2000s, Larami found that very large water guns were not profitable. So they started making smaller, less-powerful ones, and that really motivated people like me. We thought, Hey, can we modify these water guns? And, also, can we build our own?         \n\n \n\u00a0I have one called Super Cannon II. The problem with it is the recoil, because it\u2019s like you\u2019re shooting a rocket. If you\u2019re sending many liters of water per second out of a small hole, you\u2019re going to have a lot of recoil.         \n\n \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0A lot of people worry that water streams can cause internal bruising. But I think the recoil is a much bigger issue.         \n\n \nDefinitely. When I took the undergraduate fluid-mechanics course, I knew a lot of this stuff intuitively. Other students were confused, but I had already experimented with this stuff when I was 15. And because of the water guns, I started reading scientific papers about nozzle design. How do you design a nozzle so that a stream of water shoots farther? This is a question at the cutting edge of science. And yet a teenager can work on this problem himself, do some experiments and actually make some progress with it. And that\u2019s kind of cool.         \n\n\u00a0        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/04/magazine/who-made-that-super-soaker.html", "date": "2013-08-02", "description": "How a NASA engineer built a better water gun"}
