{"headline": "Hoax Is Revealed as Irish Star Says He Was Duped", "body": "\nManti Te\u2019o,  \n\u2019s star linebacker, was one of the feel-good stories of the 2012 college football season, excelling on the field despite the deaths of his grandmother and his girlfriend, he said, within hours of each other.         \n\nOn Wednesday, that story fell apart when the Web site Deadspin  \n saying that Te\u2019o\u2019s girlfriend never existed.         \n\nNotre Dame  \n that Te\u2019o was the victim of \u201cwhat appears to be a hoax in which someone using the fictitious name Lennay Kekua apparently ingratiated herself with Manti and then conspired with others to lead him to believe she had tragically died of leukemia.\u201d         \n\nTe\u2019o  \n, saying he was the target of \u201cwhat was apparently someone\u2019s sick joke and constant lies,\u201d and calling the situation \u201cpainful and humiliating.\u201d         \n\nAt a news conference Wednesday night, Jack Swarbrick, Notre Dame\u2019s athletic director, said Te\u2019o received a phone call in early December from a number that he thought to be Kekua\u2019s. The voice on the phone was one he had believed to be hers, Swarbrick said, and the person was telling Te\u2019o that she was not dead. Te\u2019o and his family told the university about the situation on Dec. 26, Swarbrick said, at which point Notre Dame asked an independent investigative company to look into the matter.         \n\nMuch remains unclear about whether Te\u2019o was duped or whether he somehow perpetrated the fictitious story of having a girlfriend who died in September, during the season. It was clear, however, that both Te\u2019o and the university were well aware of the situation during the onslaught of news media coverage during the lead-up to the Bowl Championship Series title game on Jan. 7. Neither corrected the record until the Deadspin article was published Wednesday.         \n\nSwarbrick said it was his understanding that, until the Deadspin article, Te\u2019o and his family planned to make a public statement about the situation next week. Te\u2019o was Notre Dame\u2019s standout player, finishing second in the Heisman Trophy balloting and leading the Irish to an unexpected berth in the national title game. On Jan. 3, four days before the B.C.S. game, Te\u2019o was asked about how the commotion and excitement of the football season helped him cope with the deaths of his girlfriend and his grandmother. \u201cI think whenever you\u2019re in football, it takes your mind off a lot of things,\u201d he said, not mentioning the girlfriend.         \n\nSwarbrick said there was no attempt to conceal the story.         \n\n\u201cThis story was coming out,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was too much online chatter about it.\u201d         \n\nSwarbrick said the university investigation found that the motive for creating a fake persona to trick Te\u2019o had simply been the sport of it. He said the perpetrators\u2019 hoax played out much like the 2010 film \u201cCatfish,\u201d in which a woman built a fake online persona in an attempt to create a relationship.         \n\nHe said Te\u2019o was targeted for the ruse because of his trusting nature.         \n\n\u201cNothing about what I have learned has shaken my faith in Manti Te\u2019o one iota,\u201d he said.         \n\nTe\u2019o, in his statement, said that over an extended period he had developed an emotional relationship with a woman he met online. He did not say whether they had met in person, but he said they had maintained a relationship online and on the phone, \u201cand I grew to care deeply about her.\u201d He said he hoped \u201cpeople can understand how trying and confusing this whole experience has been.\u201d Swarbrick said Te\u2019o told him that he had never met Kekua in person.         \n\nOver the past few months, news outlets across the country, including The New York Times, have noted the death of Te\u2019o\u2019s girlfriend and grandmother during the season.         \n\nIn October, a month after Kekua was said to have died, an article in The South Bend Tribune described the initial meeting between her and Te\u2019o in California in 2009, without attributing who had told the newspaper about the details of that meeting.         \n\n\u201cLennay Kekua was a Stanford student and Cardinal football fan when the two exchanged glances, handshakes and phone numbers that fateful weekend three seasons ago,\u201d the article said.         \n\nTe\u2019o\u2019s father, Brian, was quoted in the article as saying that, every once in a while, she would travel to Hawaii, when his son happened to be home, \u201cso he would meet with her there.\u201d He said they started as friends but had become a couple within the past year.         \n\n\u201cAnd we came to the realization that she could be our daughter-in-law,\u201d Brian Te\u2019o was quoted as saying. \u201cSadly, it won\u2019t happen now.\u201d         \n\nIt was around the time the two became a couple, the article said, that Kekua was injured in a serious car crash. And during the long recovery from the crash, it was discovered that she had leukemia, which ultimately caused her death, according to the article.         \n\nA Sports Illustrated article in October told more of the story, reporting that in the months leading up to her death, Te\u2019o \u201cdeveloped a nightly ritual in which he would go to sleep while on the phone.\u201d         \n\nThe article went on to say: \u201cWhen he woke up in the morning, his phone would show an eight-hour call, and he would hear Lennay breathing on the other end of the line. Her relatives told him that at her lowest points, as she fought to emerge from a coma, her breathing rate would increase at the sound of his voice.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/sports/ncaafootball/story-of-manti-teos-girlfriend-is-said-to-be-a-hoax.html", "date": "2013-01-16", "description": "An investigation by the Web site Deadspin found that Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te\u2019o\u2019s girlfriend, who was thought to have died of leukemia, never existed."}
