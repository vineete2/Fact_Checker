{"headline": "Russian Ties Put Cyprus Banking Crisis on East-West Fault Line", "body": "\nLIMASSOL, Cyprus \u2014 Andreas Marangos, a Porsche-driving lawyer here, had just woken up when he heard the news that threatened to destroy his and Cyprus\u2019s most lucrative business: setting up shell companies and providing financial services for wealthy Russians.         \n\nHe rushed to his computer to check whether the \u201ccrazy talk\u201d he had just heard was true \u2014 that his government had agreed last week to effectively confiscate 9.9 percent of the wealth of anyone holding more than 100,000 euros, about $129,000, in a Cyprus bank.         \n\nA week later, this Mediterranean island nation is still trying to figure out how to raise the $7.5 billion European lenders say it must have by Monday in return for a bailout. Late Saturday, the tentative plan was to seize a portion of all deposits above 100,000 euros, with the bite set at 20 percent for those banking with Cyprus\u2019s biggest bank.         \n\nFor Mr. Marangos, either plan is bad news.         \n\n\u201cSince last Saturday, we are just answering calls from angry clients,\u201d said the lawyer, whose firm has helped Russians and Ukrainians set up 6,000 companies in Cyprus so that they can avoid taxes, benefit from a sound legal system and, they hoped, keep their money safe. Cyprus still offers those draws, he insisted, but his clients \u201cthought we had betrayed them.\u201d         \n\nAccusations of treachery, mostly aimed by poorer nations at Germany for demanding budget cuts and other painful steps in return for help, have become a regular feature of Europe\u2019s three-year-old  \n. But what began in Cyprus as just another episode in a now-familiar narrative of stingy, rich Northern Europeans versus put-upon, poor southerners has escalated into a bigger drama tinged with cold war-style language and strategic calculations involving not just money but also energy and even military power.         \n\nCyprus had been haggling with Europe for months over a bailout deal to rescue its bloated banks. Last week, the initial plan to seize money from even modest bank depositors sent swarms of panicked residents to automated teller machines to try to withdraw their money. But the crisis involves more than financial considerations.         \n\n\u201cThere is a geopolitical game going on behind all this,\u201d Mr. Marangos said.         \n\nWith just 860,000 people and a gross domestic product of only $23 billion, the Republic of Cyprus makes an unlikely strategic prize. But it sits atop a web of overlapping and potentially volatile fault lines \u2014 between East and West, the European Union and  \n, and Greece and Turkey, whose troops occupy the northern part of the island. It also has natural gas in the waters off its coast toward Israel. Nobody knows for sure yet how much \u2014 that may become clearer later this year when Houston-based Noble Energy carries out a new round of exploratory drilling.         \n\nBut just the possibility of significant reserves has raised hope in Brussels, and fear in Moscow, that Cyprus could help break the European Union\u2019s dependence on Russian-supplied gas.         \n\n\u201cThere is a clear danger of this area becoming a platform for confrontation between East and West,\u201d said Harry Tzimitras, director of  \n, a research center in the capital, Nicosia.         \n\nCyprus has until now frozen out Russian interests from offshore gas concessions, snubbing a low bid by Novatek, a Russian company whose directors include Gennady Timchenko, a wealthy  \n trader and judo club acquaintance of President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s. In talks last week in Moscow over a possible loan to Cyprus, Russia made clear that it expected a piece of the gas pie for its own companies, according to Cypriot officials and politicians.         \n\nIn Russia\u2019s view, Cyprus, which already has two British military bases, a legacy of the country\u2019s colonial past, would also be an ideal place to set up a small naval installation should the Kremlin lose access to Tartus, a Syrian port that risks being swamped by that nation\u2019s civil war.         \n\nThe Moscow talks yielded no deal and dashed hopes that Russia might ride to the rescue. But many Cypriots still view Russia as a useful counterweight to bullying by Brussels. \u201cWe are not a Trojan horse for Russia in Europe, but we are trying to protect our interests like everyone does,\u201d said Petros Zarounas, a diplomatic adviser to the Democratic Party, part of the governing coalition.         \n\nAccording to a recent opinion poll by Cyprus\u2019s Sigma television, the public mood has turned decisively against Europe and toward Russia. More than two-thirds of those surveyed agreed that Cyprus should drop the euro and move closer to Russia because of the \u201cbehavior of our European partners.\u201d Protesters outside Parliament last week waved banners cursing the European Union and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.         \n\nWith Cyprus\u2019s banks closed for more than a week now, fear-driven rumors of secret deals and big power politics have become the main coin of the realm.
