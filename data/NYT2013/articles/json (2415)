{"headline": "Management Flaws at I.R.S. Cited in Tea Party Scrutiny", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 An inspector general\u2019s report issued Tuesday blamed ineffective Internal Revenue Service management in the failure to stop employees from singling out conservative groups for added scrutiny. Congressional aides, meanwhile, sought to determine whether the Obama administration\u2019s knowledge of the effort extended beyond the I.R.S.         \n\nHouse and Senate aides said they were focusing on an Aug. 4, 2011, meeting in which the I.R.S.\u2019s chief counsel appears to have conferred with agency officials to discuss the activities of a team in the Cincinnati field office that had been subjecting applications for tax-exempt status from Tea Party and other conservative groups to a greater degree of review than those from other organizations.         \n\nUnder I.R.S. rules, the agency\u2019s chief counsel, William J. Wilkins, reports to the Treasury Department\u2019s general counsel, and investigators want to determine if Mr. Wilkins took the issue out of the independent I.R.S. to other parts of the Obama administration.         \n\nIf the inquiry determines any new link to the administration, it could change the political equation for the White House, which has stressed the I.R.S.\u2019s independence even as President Obama has castigated the agency over the allegations of political bias. A bipartisan investigation by the Senate Finance Committee built steam on Tuesday, and the House Ways and Means Committee prepared for the first hearing on the matter on Friday with an extensive request for documents from the I.R.S. The House Oversight Committee formally accused one I.R.S. official of misleading lawmakers on four occasions.         \n\n\u201cWhat we don\u2019t know at this point is whether it jumped the fence from the I.R.S. to the White House,\u201d said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader. \u201cBut we do know this: we can\u2019t count on the administration to be forthcoming about the details of this scandal, because so far they\u2019ve been anything but.\u201d         \n\nLate Tuesday, Mr. Obama said in a statement that \u201cthe report\u2019s findings are intolerable and inexcusable.\u201d\u00a0         \n\n\u201cThe federal government must conduct itself in a way that\u2019s worthy of the public\u2019s trust, and that\u2019s especially true for the I.R.S.,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThis report shows that some of its employees failed that test.\u201d         \n\nHe said he was asking Jacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary, \u201cto hold those responsible for these failures accountable, and to make sure that each of the inspector general\u2019s recommendations are implemented quickly.\u201d         \n\nThe Obama administration tried to stay ahead of the furor with an announcement by Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. that he had ordered a federal investigation into whether I.R.S. officials broke any criminal laws by singling out the conservative groups.         \n\n\u201cThe F.B.I. is coordinating with the Justice Department to see if any laws were broken in connection with those matters related to the I.R.S.,\u201d Mr. Holder told reporters. \u201cThose were, I think, as everyone can agree, if not criminal, they were certainly outrageous and unacceptable, but we are examining the facts to see if there were criminal violations.\u201d         \n\nBut a matter portrayed by the I.R.S. on Friday as a little-known operation conducted in Cincinnati, largely out of the sight of Washington officials, continued to sprawl. The report by the Treasury inspector general for tax administration offered new details on the scope and duration of the I.R.S. targeting effort.         \n\nMismanagement at the agency allowed \u201cinappropriate criteria\u201d for the singling out of conservative groups to be developed and stay in place for more than 18 months, starting in 2010, the report said. That resulted in \u201csubstantial delays\u201d for groups applying for tax-exempt status, either as 501(c)(4) or 501(c)(3) organizations, and it allowed unnecessary and intrusive information like donor lists to be gathered. I.R.S. officials told the inspector general that all donor information received was later destroyed.         \n\nOf the 296 applications the inspector general reviewed, 108 were approved, 28 were withdrawn by the applicants and 160 were still open, some pending for up to 1,138 days.
