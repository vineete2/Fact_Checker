{"headline": "Senate Approves Ban on Antigay Bias in Workplace", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate on Thursday approved a ban on discrimination in the workplace based on sexual orientation and gender identity, voting 64 to 32 in a bipartisan show of support that is rare for any social issue. It was the first time in the institution\u2019s history that it had voted to include gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people in the country\u2019s nondiscrimination law.         \n\nDespite initial wariness among many Republicans about the bill, 10 of them voted with 54 members of the Democratic majority to approve the measure.         \n\nBut nothing is guaranteed in the House, where Speaker John A. Boehner has repeatedly said he opposes the bill.         \n\nPresident Obama hailed the Senate action and urged House Republican leaders to bring the bill to the floor for a vote.         \n\n\u201cOne party in one house of Congress should not stand in the way of millions of Americans who want to go to work each day and simply be judged by the job they do,\u201d Mr. Obama said in a statement. \u201cNow is the time to end this kind of discrimination in the workplace, not enable it.\u201d         \n\nSenator Harry Reid, the majority leader, said on Thursday that \u201cthe time has come for Congress to pass a federal law that ensures all citizens, regardless of where they live, can go to work not afraid of who they are.\u201d He noted that a vast majority of Americans already think such a law is in place. \u201cWell, it isn\u2019t already the law,\u201d he added. \u201cLet\u2019s do what the American people think already exists.\u201d         \n\nSenate Republicans who voted against the bill, known as the Employment Nondiscrimination Act, were muted in their opposition. The first senator to rise and speak against the bill on the floor all week was Dan Coats of Indiana, who said Thursday morning that religious freedoms were at risk, despite the bill\u2019s broad exemption for religious institutions.         \n\nThose exemptions, he said, did not go far enough.         \n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t pick and choose when to adhere to the Constitution, and when to cast it aside,\u201d Mr. Coats said. \u201cThe so-called protections from religious liberty in this bill are vaguely defined and do not extend to all organizations that wish to adhere to their moral or religious beliefs in their hiring practices.\u201d         \n\nThe bill includes a number of protections for religious entities, some of which were added this week to gain more Republican support. It now contains a provision that says no federal agency or state or local government that accepts money from the federal government can retaliate against religious institutions for not complying. This would include actions like denying them tax-exempt status, grant money, licenses or certifications.         \n\nThe institutions that are exempt from the bill include churches, synagogues and mosques that are expressly religious in nature. This would also extend to schools or retail stores affiliated directly with churches, but it would not apply to those that have only loose religious affiliations.         \n\nThe scene inside the Senate chamber on Thursday was far different from the last time a vote on a gay rights nondiscrimination bill was held 17 years ago. That measure failed by one vote on the same day that a ban on recognizing same-sex marriages overwhelmingly passed. Senators on the floor condemned homosexuality as immoral.         \n\n\u201cThe drive for same-sex marriage,\u201d Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, said at the time, \u201cis, in effect, an effort to make a sneak attack on society by encoding this aberrant behavior in legal form before society itself has decided it should be legal.\u201d         \n\nMr. Coats, who was the only Republican to speak against the bill on Thursday, also spoke up in 1996, calling same-sex marriage \u201ctrendy moral relativism.\u201d         \n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Coats made no mention of homosexuality. He limited his remarks to the religious freedom aspect of the legislation.         \n\nThere was another notable difference from 1996. Two of the Republican senators who voted no then, John McCain of Arizona and Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, voted yes on Thursday.
