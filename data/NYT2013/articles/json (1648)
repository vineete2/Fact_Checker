He has divided the world \u2014 at least, the helter-skelter world of commercial minibuses in which he has made his living for 11 years \u2014 into two camps: the safe drivers and everyone else.         \n\n\u201cIncredible!\u201d Mr. Cruz, 42, exclaimed as a competing minibus zipped around him on Bergenline Avenue here and blew through a red light in the hunt for the next fare.         \n\n\u201cYou got some animals,\u201d he muttered. \u201cSome people just don\u2019t care.\u201d         \n\nEver since July 30, when a minibus barreled off a busy road in this small town and  \n in her stroller, a torrent of outrage has been directed at Mr. Cruz\u2019s industry, an informal, loosely regulated network of minibuses that has evolved over the past few decades into a bustling commuter system linking gentrifying and working-class communities in New Jersey with Manhattan.         \n\nThe death has drawn intense scrutiny to what for many riders is a critical 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week alternative to the large fleet of more conventional buses operated by New Jersey Transit that are often overcrowded and more expensive.         \n\nKnown by a range of names \u2014 jitneys, dollar buses, guaguas, colectivos \u2014 the minibuses carry an eclectic mix of riders: construction workers with their tools, corporate employees, the unemployed looking for work, late-night revelers in high heels and travelers lugging suitcases to inexpensive New Jersey motels.         \n\nBut for all their conveniences, their drivers have developed a reputation for flouting conventional traffic laws as they jockey for fares, picking up and dropping off passengers at random locations, blocking traffic and driving recklessly in a rhythm reminiscent of a bumper car ride at an amusement park.         \n\nOfficials said that at the time of the fatal crash last month, the driver of the bus, Idowu Daramola, 48, was speeding and using his cellphone before plowing into a light pole, which fell over and crushed the baby girl, Angelie Paredes. Mr. Daramola has been charged with death by auto, reckless driving and using a cellphone while operating a vehicle.         \n\nSince then, almost everyone connected to minibuses \u2014 passengers, drivers, company owners and public officials \u2014 has called for stricter regulation.         \n\nThis consensus, though, has not translated into unity. Officials blame the company owners and drivers; the drivers blame the owners and one another; the owners blame other companies and their drivers; the passengers blame everyone, not least the authorities for allowing the hazards and disorder to persist.         \n\nBut the drivers and company owners, even as they call for more oversight, have also cautioned against an overreaction by the authorities that would threaten an industry largely run by striving immigrants and serving a largely working-class immigrant ridership.         \n\n\u201cWe want to protect the industry,\u201d said Sergio Garces, 59, a Chilean immigrant and president of a recently formed association of jitney drivers.         \n\nJitney loyalists say the minibuses are cheaper and quicker than New Jersey Transit, whose full-size buses work the same routes but come less often, particularly late at night, and will bypass stops during the morning and afternoon rush because they are already full.         \n\nEarly one recent morning, Anna Alvarez, 34, stood on South Marginal Highway in Weehawken, not far from the entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel, waiting for a jitney to take her to her job in Manhattan. \u201cI usually take it due to the fact that you sometimes wait long for the buses,\u201d Ms. Alvarez said.         \n\nUnderscoring her point, jitneys heading for Manhattan rolled by at a clip of about one per minute, charging $3 a ride; New Jersey Transit buses, charging $3.20, were far less frequent.         \n\nBut Mauricio Gonzalez, 47, a Colombian hair stylist, was content to wait. \u201cThey\u2019re crazy, these guys,\u201d he said as he let numerous jitneys pass in favor of the next New Jersey Transit bus. \u201cThey go so fast, they don\u2019t care about nothing and it\u2019s hot inside.\u201d         \n\nIt is an amorphous industry. Nobody seems to know just how many jitneys are in operation. Government officials and longtime operators estimated that there were hundreds of buses.
