{"headline": "Security Check Now Starts Long Before You Fly", "body": "\nThe Transportation Security Administration is expanding its screening of passengers before they arrive at the airport by searching a wide array of government and private databases that can include records like car registrations and employment information.         \n\nWhile the agency says that the goal is to streamline the security procedures for millions of passengers who pose no risk, the new measures give the government greater authority to use travelers\u2019 data for domestic airport screenings. Previously that level of scrutiny applied only to individuals entering the United States.         \n\nThe prescreening, some of which is already taking place, is described in documents the T.S.A. released to comply with government regulations about the collection and use of individuals\u2019 data, but the details of the program have not been publicly announced.         \n\nIt is unclear precisely what information the agency is relying upon to make these risk assessments, given the extensive range of records it can access, including tax identification number, past travel itineraries, property records, physical characteristics, and law enforcement or intelligence information.         \n\nThe measures go beyond the background check the government has conducted for years, called Secure Flight, in which a passenger\u2019s name, gender and date of birth are compared with terrorist watch lists. Now, the search includes using a traveler\u2019s passport number, which is already used to screen people at the border, and other identifiers to access a system of databases maintained by the Department of Homeland Security.         \n\nPrivacy groups contacted by The New York Times expressed concern over the security agency\u2019s widening reach.         \n\n\u201cI think the best way to look at it is as a pre-crime assessment every time you fly,\u201d said Edward Hasbrouck, a consultant to the Identity Project, one of the groups that oppose the prescreening initiatives. \u201cThe default will be the highest, most intrusive level of search, and anything less will be conditioned on providing some additional information in some fashion.\u201d         \n\nThe T.S.A., which has been criticized for a one-size-fits-all approach to screening travelers, said the initiatives were needed to make the procedures more targeted.         \n\n\u201cSecure Flight has successfully used information provided to airlines to identify and prevent known or suspected terrorists or other individuals on no-fly lists from gaining access to airplanes or secure areas of airports,\u201d the security agency said in a statement. \u201cAdditional risk assessments are used for those higher-risk passengers.\u201d         \n\nAn agency official discussed some aspects of the initiative on the condition that she not be identified. She emphasized that the main goal of the program was to identify low-risk travelers for lighter screening at airport security checkpoints, adapting methods similar to those used to flag suspicious people entering the United States.         \n\nAnyone who has never traveled outside the United States would not have a passport number on file and would therefore not be subject to the rules that the agency uses to determine risk, she said, although documents indicate that the agency is prescreening all passengers in some fashion.         \n\nThe official added that these rules consider things like an individual\u2019s travel itinerary, length of stay abroad and type of travel document, like a passport. If an airline has a traveler\u2019s passport number on file, it is required to share that information with the T.S.A., even for a domestic flight.         \n\nThe agency also receives a code indicating a passenger is a member of the airline\u2019s frequent-flier program and has access to details about past travel reservations, known as passenger name records. This official could not confirm if that information was being used to assess a passenger\u2019s risk.         \n\nThe effort comes as the agency is trying to increase participation in its trusted traveler program, called PreCheck, that allows frequent fliers to pass through security more quickly after submitting their fingerprints and undergoing a criminal-background check.
