{"headline": "Typhoon in Philippines Casts Long Shadow Over U.N. Talks on Climate Treaty", "body": "\nThe typhoon that struck the Philippines produced an outpouring of emotion on Monday at United Nations talks on a global climate treaty in Warsaw, where delegates were quick to suggest that a warming planet had turned the storm into a lethal monster.         \n\nOlai Ngedikes, the lead negotiator for an alliance of small island nations,  \n that the typhoon, named Haiyan, which by some estimates killed 10,000 people in one city alone, \u201cserves as a stark reminder of the cost of inaction on climate change and should serve to motivate our work in Warsaw.\u201d         \n\nNaderev Sa\u00f1o, the chief representative of the Philippines at the conference, said he would stop eating in solidarity with the storm victims until \u201ca meaningful outcome is in sight.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWhat my country is going through as a result of this extreme climate event is madness; the climate crisis is madness,\u201d Mr. Sa\u00f1o said. \u201cWe can stop this madness right here in Warsaw.\u201d         \n\nHis declaration, coupled with the scope of the disaster, moved many of the delegates to tears.         \n\nYet scientists remain cautious about drawing links between extreme storms like this typhoon and climate change. There is not enough data, they say, to draw conclusions about any single storm.         \n\n\u201cWhether we\u2019re seeing some result of climate change, we find that impossible to find out,\u201d said  \n, an atmospheric scientist at M.I.T.         \n\nScientists largely agree that it appears that storms will become more powerful as the climate changes. Dr. Emanuel helped write a 2010 study, for example, that forecast that the average intensity of hurricanes and typhoons \u2014  \n \u2014 would increase by up to 11 percent by the end of the century.         \n\nTyphoon Haiyan, with winds of at least 140 miles an hour, was considered one of the strongest storms to make landfall on record. \u201cThe data suggests that things like this will be more frequent with global warming,\u201d said James P. Kossin, an atmospheric scientist at the  \n.         \n\nDr. Emanuel said that as the planet warms because of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases, the difference between sea and air temperatures increases. It is this difference that fuels these kinds of cyclonic storms.         \n\n\u201cAs you warm the climate, you basically raise the speed limit on hurricanes,\u201d he said.         \n\nAs with Hurricane Sandy last year in the United States, powerful storm surges contributed to the deaths and destruction in the Philippines. And Dr. Kossin and others noted that one of the impacts of climate change \u2014 an overall rise in sea levels \u2014 is sure to worsen storm surges. While factors like wind speed, storm track, geography and the timing of tides affect the height and extent of a surge and the damage it causes, a higher sea level baseline will lead to a higher surge.         \n\n\u201cWhen you strip everything else away, we\u2019re seeing a general rise in sea level,\u201d Dr. Kossin said. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that storm surge is going to be compounded.\u201d         \n\nThe effect of climate change on storms in the Pacific is especially difficult to study, scientists said, because no governments fly research planes into storms there to gather data. In the Atlantic, the United States government regularly sends reconnaissance flights into hurricanes, but the last regular flights into Pacific typhoons \u2014 also by American aircraft \u2014 occurred more than a quarter of a century ago. \u201cSince then, we\u2019ve been pretty much blind,\u201d Dr. Emanuel said.         \n\nInstead, researchers have to rely on remote sensing data from satellites that essentially detect the degree of cloud cover, and use pattern-recognition software and algorithms to come up with estimates of storm intensity. Dr. Kossin used that data  \n of the Pacific that found \u201cthat the strongest storms are getting stronger,\u201d he said.         \n\nIn Warsaw, some of the delegates expressed hope that the typhoon and its aftermath would give fresh impetus to the talks.         \n\n\u201cThe scale of the response in the talks must match with what is clearly an escalating situation,\u201d Dessima Williams, a former chairwoman of the alliance of island states, said in an interview from Warsaw.         \n\nThe negotiations, which will last about two weeks, are another step in a long effort to replace a weak treaty, the Kyoto Protocol, which failed to slow the growth of greenhouse gas emissions, with a new one that would take effect in 2020.         \n\nThe Philippines disaster is likely to be cited by delegates debating one of the main issues, a longstanding fight about climate justice. As global warming proceeds, some of the poorest people in the world, who have had the least to do with the burning of fossil fuels, stand to be among the primary victims in small island nations and in countries like Bangladesh, India and the Philippines.         \n\nDeveloping countries want the West \u2014 historically responsible for emissions, for the most part \u2014 not only to take the lead in reducing the use of fossil fuels, but to put up huge amounts of money to help poorer countries adapt to climatic changes that have already become inevitable. Western governments, which in some cases are already starting to consider their own adaptations to climate change, agree in principle that they should help poor countries. But they have committed relatively small sums, and they are wary of letting fast-growing countries like China off the hook on emissions.         \n\nAnalysts say the likeliest outcome of the Warsaw negotiations is a weak pact that essentially urges countries to do what they can to cut emissions.
