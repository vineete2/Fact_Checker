If you need yet another example of how much the world has changed, try this: The song was already popular in England, but had not been released in the United States, and so an enterprising D.J. from the American station had a copy of the record flown here and delivered to his studio by a flight attendant, (which was the 1960s version of the Pony Express.)         \n\nThe song was written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney as they describe  \nand had been intended for release on \u201cThe Ed Sullivan Show\u201d a few months later. It was the Beatles\u2019 best-selling single worldwide.         \n\nOf all the covers that have been made since, Al Green\u2019s 1969 version is my favorite. In a 2010 article listing the 50 best all-time Beatles\u2019 covers, Paste magazine named Mr. Green\u2019s version No. 1. It was his big breakthrough. He then went on to create his own hits, including \u201cLet\u2019s Stay Together\u201d and \u201cTired of Being Alone.\u201d         \n\nPaste magazine\u2019s No. 2 all-time Beatles cover? A tie between Rufus Wainwright\u2019s and Fiona Apple\u2019s versions of \u201cAcross the Universe.\u201d That\u2019s the song released in 1969 that includes the line \u201cNothing\u2019s gonna change my world\u201d \u2014 but by then, the Beatles had completely changed ours.         \n\n \n         \nI Want To Hold Your Hand (Live) - The Beatles on Ed Sullivan Show \n\n \n         \nAl Green I want to hold your hand \n\n \n         \nThe Beatles - Across The Universe \n\n \n         \nFiona Apple - \"Across The Universe\" \n\n \n         \nRufus Wainwright - Across The Universe", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/17/booming/the-beatles-i-want-to-hold-your-hand-then-al-greens.html", "date": "2013-12-17", "description": "Of all the covers made of the Beatles\u2019 single \u201cI Want to Hold Your Hand,\u201d Al Green\u2019s 1969 version has drawn most praise."}
