{"headline": "Rights Group Is Seeking Status of \u2018Legal Person\u2019 for Captive Chimpanzee", "body": "\nChimpanzees are not people, no matter how they are dressed up for commercials, but perhaps they are close enough that they deserve some of the same rights humans have.         \n\nThat is what an animal rights group claimed on Monday when it filed a classic writ of habeas corpus, that revered staple of American and English law and tired clich\u00e9 of detective fiction \u2014 not for a human being held unlawfully, but for Tommy, a chimpanzee in Gloversville, N.Y.         \n\nThis is no stunt. The  \n has been working on this legal strategy for years, sifting through decisions in all 50 states to find one that is strong on what is called common law, and one that recognizes animals as legal persons for the purpose of being the beneficiary of a trust.         \n\nThe leader of the project, Steven M. Wise, who has written about the history of habeas corpus writs in the fight against human slavery and who views the crusade for animal rights as a lifelong project, said New York fit the bill. His legal action added a milestone to a year that has already been remarkable for chimpanzees, with one federal agency taking steps to retire most chimps owned by the government and another proposing to classify all chimps as endangered, an action that would throw up new obstacles to experiments even on privately owned chimps.         \n\nActivists have relished their successes, while some scientists have deplored restrictions on the use of the animals, which have played a crucial role in some biomedical research, such as work on hepatitis C vaccines.         \n\nUntil now, all the actions have addressed the issue of animal welfare, not animal rights. But Mr. Wise filed  \n on Monday in State Supreme Court in Fulton County, N.Y., demanding that courts in New York recognize Tommy as a legal person, with a right to liberty, but one that has its limits.         \n\nTommy, the group says, \u201cis being held captive in a cage in a shed at a used-trailer lot.\u201d         \n\nThe petition does not ask the court to set Tommy free to roam Gloversville, or to send him back to Africa after a life in captivity. It asks the court to remove him from his owners and place him in a sanctuary.         \n\nThe group said it intended to file suit later this week on behalf of three more chimps in New York, also demanding their freedom. Two of the chimpanzees are believed to be owned by the New Iberia Research Center, at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, but are housed at Stony Brook University for a study of locomotion. The fourth, according to the rights project, is owned by Carmen Presti of Niagara Falls, who runs the Primate Sanctuary, a nonprofit organization that has monkeys and the one chimpanzee.         \n\nPatrick C. Lavery, the owner of Circle L Trailer Sales in Gloversville, where Tommy lives, said he heard about the petition from reporters\u2019 telephone calls. He said from his home in Florida that he had complied with all state and federal regulations, that Tommy had a spacious cage \u201cwith tons of toys,\u201d and that he had been trying to place him in sanctuaries, but that they had no room. He said he had rescued the chimp from his previous home, where he was badly treated.         \n\n\u201cPeople ought to use common sense,\u201d he said. Of the Nonhuman Rights Project, a group he was not aware of, he said, \u201cIf they were to see where this chimp lived for the first 30 years of his life, they would jump up and down for joy about where he is now.\u201d         \n\nThe other people who are named in the petitions being filed this week did not immediately comment.         \n\nThe use of habeas corpus actions is a time-honored legal strategy for addressing unlawful imprisonment of human beings. Mr. Wise argues in a 70-plus-page memo rich with legal, scientific and philosophical references that being human is not essential to having rights. He argues that captive chimps are, in fact, enslaved, and that the same principles apply to them as to humans who were enslaved.         \n\n\u201cThis petition asks this court to issue a writ recognizing that Tommy is not a legal thing to be possessed by respondents, but rather is a cognitively complex autonomous legal person with the fundamental legal right not to be imprisoned,\u201d the court filing says.
