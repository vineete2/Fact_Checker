{"headline": "Obama\u2019s Defender of\nBorders Is Again a\nVoice for Migrants", "body": "\nMEXICO CITY \u2014 For two decades, Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz was a fiery  \n rights lobbyist who denounced deportations, demanded change in Congress and once wrote of \u201cthat hollow place that outrage carves in your soul.\u201d When she was invited to a White House briefing in 1997 on immigration, Ms. Mu\u00f1oz, who was born in Detroit, was furious after staff members asked twice if she was an American citizen.         \n\nBut after a call from  \n in 2008, Ms. Mu\u00f1oz crossed to the other side to help push the administration\u2019s promised immigration overhaul \u2014 only to find herself defending a border enforcement policy under which nearly 1.5 million people have been deported in four years. Critics denounced her as a traitor and demanded that she resign.         \n\n\u201cShe did become, in some ways, the face of the president\u2019s policy,\u201d said Angela Maria Kelley, a friend of more than 20 years and a fellow immigration activist. Other activists said Ms. Mu\u00f1oz was championing deportation policies far worse than the ones she had fought against. She was \u201cdeployed to defend the indefensible,\u201d said Pablo Alvarado, whose day laborer organization was repeatedly at odds with her.         \n\nNow, as Mr. Obama is in Latin America this week as the first president in decades with a chance to get an overhaul of the nation\u2019s immigration laws through Congress, Ms. Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s loyalty in the face of her battering appears to have paid off. After four long years, she has helped Mr. Obama prod a reluctant capital toward citizenship for more than 11 million illegal immigrants.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we would have gotten this far without her,\u201d said Angelica Salas, the executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles.         \n\nMs. Mu\u00f1oz, 50, the winner of a $500,000 MacArthur Foundation \u201cgenius grant\u201d in 2000 for her work as a civil rights activist, operates out of a second-floor corner office in the West Wing, where she is an earnest, wonky presence known for her negotiation skills. Her title is director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, but her chief influence has been on what could be Mr. Obama\u2019s biggest domestic accomplishment of his second term.         \n\nShe has built support for an immigration overhaul with religious leaders, unions and business executives; has held online forums with workers who are in the country illegally; has appeared on Spanish-language television; and has helped draft a bill that the president threatened to introduce if talks on Capitol Hill faltered. This week in Mexico City, she has been at Mr. Obama\u2019s side in his meetings with President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, where the immigration legislation is a central focus.         \n\nIn the weeks ahead, Ms. Mu\u00f1oz will have a crucial role in trying to keep the immigration bill from unraveling in the face of opposition from conservative radio hosts and Republican lawmakers, some of whom have seized on the  \n bombings as a reason to delay action.         \n\n\u201cOne of the great and poignant things for me is that the issues I\u2019ve been working on my whole career, which are Latino community priorities, I\u2019ve spent a career arguing that those are the country\u2019s priorities too,\u201d Ms. Mu\u00f1oz said in an interview with The New York Times in January, part of an oral history of Mr. Obama\u2019s first term. \u201cThey\u2019re this administration\u2019s priorities as well, and it\u2019s an extraordinary thing to be working on the same set of issues on behalf of the country.\u201d Ms. Mu\u00f1oz declined to be interviewed for this article.         \n\nBut after bringing credibility \u2014 and political cover \u2014 to Mr. Obama on immigration when she arrived at the White House in early 2009, Ms. Mu\u00f1oz had her reputation as a fearless advocate for Latinos threatened by her defense of the president\u2019s deportation policy. A little more than a year into the job, tempers flared to the point that Chris Newman, an advocate for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, got into a yelling match with Ms. Mu\u00f1oz during a session in the Old Executive Office Building about the impact of the deportations on families.         \n\nAt the end of 2010, she faced a big setback: the Dream Act, a measure pushed by the White House to provide legal status for immigrants who arrived in the country as young children, failed in the Senate. \u201cThe people who were crying got hugs,\u201d Ms. Mu\u00f1oz said in January, recounting how Mr. Obama consoled her and others after the vote. The president said, she recalled, \u201cThink of the civil rights movement and how long those battles took.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/04/us/politics/cecilia-munozs-perseverance-in-immigration-push.html", "date": "2013-05-03", "description": "Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, a longtime activist, was denounced after she joined the Obama administration and defended its deportation policy.
