{"headline": "From an Office Romance to Home Cooking", "body": "\n \n         \n\nJim and Linda Addy met in the early 1970s at a Manhattan promotions agency where the two briefly worked together. They have been married 37 years. Jim now owns L & J Promotion Products and Linda is an insurance agent and financial adviser. They live on the Upper East Side and have two adult children. A condensed and edited version of our conversations follows.         \n\n \n         \n\nLinda: I was 19 and going to night school at Hunter College, so I was looking for a part-time job that wasn\u2019t too taxing. A friend got me an interview as a receptionist at the agency where Jim was vice president. He was the one who interviewed me. He asked why I wanted to be a receptionist and I told him no one wants to be a receptionist. I didn\u2019t even want to work. But Jim was so adorable. When the interview was done I called my mom from the reception area and told her that if I didn\u2019t get the job she\u2019d have to help me think of an excuse to call him back.         \n\nJim: I hired her. Later on, the president of the company wanted a secretary and suggested Linda. I objected. I just didn\u2019t think she would be a great secretary, but I was overruled. After about six or eight months, I fired her.         \n\n \n         \n\nLinda: It didn\u2019t take long. We all used to go out and drink after work. One night he had tickets for the ballet and had forgotten to invite someone to go with him and that was it. I moved in piece by piece; he never knew what hit him. One day he just opened the medicine cabinet and realized it wasn\u2019t just him living there.         \n\nJim: We started to date against the better wishes of the owner of the company, but office romances were fairly common.         \n\n \n         \n\nJim: I wanted to take her.         \n\n \n         \n\nLinda: He says he fired me; I say I quit. I got a better job offer at an advertising agency.         \n\nJim: It was a little tense, but she just was not a good secretary.         \n\n \n         \n\nJim: Her typing was slow. She just wasn\u2019t ready to manage the schedules of two people. But in truth, she just wasn\u2019t in to it. She wanted to work there because she met me.         \n\n \n         \n\nJim: She was getting antsy, saying that it was time to go to the next stage. I finally succumbed and bought an engagement ring and put it in a long watch box to give to her on Christmas Eve.         \n\nLinda: We would exchange gifts with friends on Christmas Eve, but this year we\u2019d decided not to bring our gifts for each other. At some point someone hands me this long box, like for a bracelet. There was an engagement ring inside. Now at this point all our friends knew I wanted to get engaged, but Jim had always said he didn\u2019t want to marry until he was 30. I thought the ring was a joke and I tossed it across the room. They all knew but I didn\u2019t. Jim\u2019s color drained right out of his face. We all dug through wrapping paper looking for it.         \n\n \n         \n\nLinda: That was Christmas Eve, 1973. Jim turned 30 on January 8, 1976, and we married on March 6.         \n\n \n         \n\nJim: I had just made this promise to myself and had every intention of keeping it. I wanted to be sure I knew what I wanted to do, just didn\u2019t want to get married young and frankly it frightened me; all that added responsibility of having to care for another person. My attitude toward marriage is that it\u2019s a commitment for life. After we married it became obvious to me that I made the right choice; that all that responsibility was within my ability and we went from there.         \n\n \n         \n\nLinda: Well, I picked a date after he turned 30 that wasn\u2019t near any other gift-giving holidays. It wasn\u2019t a big wedding, about 40 people, mostly family.         \n\nJim: It was a small wedding, we were both on the poor side. I was in a daze the entire time.         \n\n \n         \n\nJim: We didn\u2019t try. I had no idea. She had a plan and I was too busy working. I certainly wanted kids; I just hadn\u2019t said, \u201cO.K., now is the time.\u201d It was a happy surprise.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/26/booming/after-he-hired-and-fired-her-37-years-of-marriage.html", "date": "2013-04-26", "description": "Jim and Linda Addy have found over 37 years of  marriage that liking each other is just as important as loving."}
