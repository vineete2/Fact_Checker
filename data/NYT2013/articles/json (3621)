{"headline": "Knicks Owner Is Singing the Blues, and So Is His Team", "body": "\nORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 \u201cHello everybody!\u201d  \n shouted into the microphone in front of about 100 people who had arrived early at the Amway Center for an Eagles concert.         \n\nMost of the crowd had never heard of the opening band, J D & The Straight Shot, so Dolan introduced the group. \u201cWe\u2019re a band from New York City,\u201d he said.         \n\nThat much was true. But what Dolan did not mention was that, in addition to being the band\u2019s rumble-voiced lead singer, he is the president and chief executive of Cablevision, and the owner of the  \n.         \n\nAs Dolan\u2019s band performed here on Saturday, a night after performing at the American Airlines Arena in Miami, his basketball team, the second-most expensive in the league, was in the midst of another dispiriting loss. The Knicks are a shambling, desultory group these days, stumbling through an opening month that has been worse than even pessimistic fans feared.         \n\nBut as the Knicks fell to the Wizards in Washington and their fans burned, Dolan and his band fiddled through covers of \u201970s songs like \u201cLet It Roll\u201d and \u201cWhite Bird.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThis is someone wealthy who is having a good time,\u201d Randy Sturdevant, a retired electrical contractor, said to his wife during the show. \u201cThis is some rich guy\u2019s hobby.\u201d         \n\nThe band plays a mixture of blues and rock. In 2011, The New York Times\u2019 pop music critic, Jon Pareles, described Dolan as a \u201ckaraoke-grade singer.\u201d Dolan\u2019s son, Aidan, plays guitar in the band. But the other band members are seasoned musicians who have played with Bob Dylan, Aretha Franklin and Bon Jovi, among others.         \n\nDolan\u2019s moonlighting gigs are hardly a secret in the basketball world, although the fact he was playing in  \n arenas this past weekend, and not some small New York club, would probably catch any number of people by surprise, including a lot of people who root for the Knicks. One of those fans, apparently, has hijacked the Wikipedia page for Dolan\u2019s band, renaming songs with titles like \u201cCan\u2019t Make the Knicks Win,\u201d \u201cWasting Knicks Fans Time,\u201d \u201cReunion with Isiah in Hell\u201d and \u201cTry Selling the Knicks.\u201d         \n\nDolan has, in fact, recorded a song called \u201cFix the Knicks,\u201d which appeared on the band\u2019s 2011 album. It begins with the line: \u201c \n         \n\nJ D & The Straight Shot did not play \u201cFix the Knicks\u201d on Saturday \u2014 perhaps because it would be hard to know where to start.         \n\nA team that played harmoniously for much of last season in going 54-28 is completely out of sync this time around. The extra pass is not being made, the defense is too often lax. Home-court advantage has been abandoned, with the Knicks having lost their last six games at Madison Square Garden.         \n\nAnd the individual headaches are many. Amar\u2019e Stoudemire is owed $45 million through this season and next, but has turned into something of an afterthought because of his damaged knees.         \n\nIman Shumpert, a young player who was seen to have a big upside because he can both defend and score, has instead turned into an underperforming mystery and the subject of trade rumors. In Monday\u2019s loss to Portland, he failed to register a point, rebound or assist in 23 minutes of action.         \n\nTyson Chandler, a rock in the middle for the Knicks, is out indefinitely with a leg injury.  \n, the team\u2019s one bona-fide star, will opt out of his contract at the end of the season and could sign elsewhere.         \n\nAll of this has resulted in a disorienting 3-10 record going into Wednesday\u2019s game in Los Angeles against the Clippers. The notion that the Knicks might be able to contend for a championship this season already seems far-fetched.         \n\nIn Dolan\u2019s long run as the man in charge of the Knicks, the team has never won a title, and has often been inept. But if he has proved hapless at turning the Knicks into a consistently competitive team, he has shown some success in promoting J D & the Straight Shot. He has also appeared willing to flex his corporate muscle to boost the band.         \n\nOne of the band\u2019s songs, \u201cCan\u2019t Make Tears,\u201d has been used in the show \u201cHell on Wheels,\u201d which airs on AMC \u2014 a channel controlled by Cablevision. Joe Gayton, one of the show\u2019s creators, said Dolan is a huge fan of the show and let it be known he wanted one of his songs featured on it. Gayton and the producers complied. \u201cCan\u2019t Make Tears\u201d was also made into a music video, using various scenes from \u201cHell on Wheels.\u201d         \n\nThe band has also opened for Willie Nelson and at other venues for the Eagles. Indeed, the Eagles played a three-night stand at the Garden earlier this month, although J D & The Straight Shot did not perform at those shows.         \n\nAnd on Saturday night, Dolan announced from the stage that one of the band\u2019s songs would be featured in an upcoming Meryl Streep movie, \u201cAugust: Osage County.\u201d         \n\nAsked whether Dolan was using his corporate position to promote his band, and whether it was disconcerting for him to be on the road performing while his team was struggling, Barry Watkins, the Garden\u2019s executive vice president of communications, responded that The Times was pursuing a \u201cline of unfair questioning.\u201d         \n\n\u201cEveryone has time off of their jobs and spends free time in ways they choose,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see no reason to comment further.\u201d         \n\nMeanwhile, those in attendance Saturday night, whether they realized who Dolan was or not, seemed to more or less enjoy his band\u2019s performance.         \n\n\u201cIt was excellent music, and he seems to have a great personality,\u201d said Sturdevant, the retired contractor. \u201cEven though you might be able to buy your way onto that stage, the Eagles would still only allow someone good to open for them.\u201d         \n\nAs the set wound down, Dolan even told the audience \u2014 which by then had grown to several thousand \u2014 that they could receive a free CD in return for their email address.         \n\n\u201cWe want to thank the Eagles for letting us open up for them,\u201d Dolan said. \u201cThey\u2019re truly gracious and we\u2019re truly grateful.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/27/sports/basketball/knicks-owner-is-singing-the-blues-and-so-is-his-team.html", "date": "2013-11-26", "description": "If James L.
