{"headline": "Ancient Martian Lake May Have Supported Life", "body": "\nAbout 3.5 billion years ago \u2014 around the time  \n \u2014 Mars had a large freshwater lake that might well have been hospitable to life, scientists reported Monday.         \n\nThe lake lay in the same crater where NASA\u2019s  \n and  \n. It lasted for hundreds or thousands of years, and possibly much longer.         \n\nWhether any life ever appeared on Mars is not yet known, and Curiosity was not designed to answer that question. But the data coming back from the planet indicate that the possibility of life, at least in the ancient past, is at least plausible.         \n\n \n, a professor of geology at the California Institute of Technology who is the project scientist for the Curiosity mission, said that if certain microbes like those on present-day Earth had plopped into that ancient Martian lake, they would most likely have found a pleasant place to call home.         \n\n\u201cThe environment would have existed long enough that they could have been sustained, prospered, grown, multiplied,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the essential ingredients for life were present.         \n\n\u201cPotentially the aqueous stream, lake, groundwater system could have existed for millions to tens of millions of years,\u201d he added. \u201cYou could easily get a lake with the area of the Finger Lakes in upstate New York.\u201d         \n\nThe interpretation comes from detailed analysis of two mudstones drilled by Curiosity earlier this year. The structure, chemistry and mineralogy of the sedimentary rocks were not alien.         \n\n\u201cThe whole thing just seems extremely Earthlike,\u201d Dr. Grotzinger said.         \n\nThe scientists presented their latest findings at a meeting of the  \n in San Francisco and in  \n.         \n\nThe surface of Mars today is frigid and arid, bombarded by sterilizing radiation, but after it formed and cooled with the rest of the solar system about 4.5 billion years ago, it was initially a warmer and wetter place during its first billion years. Over the past decade, scientists have identified several sites on Mars that they think were once habitable.         \n\nIn 2004, after  \n discovered evidence that the Martian places it was traversing had once been soaking wet,  \n, the mission\u2019s principal investigator, declared, \u201cThis is the kind of place that would have been suitable for life.\u201d         \n\nBut that location would have been an extremely challenging environment for life to take hold \u2014 very salty and highly acidic. Later, the scientists said the soils had been soaked not so much by water as by sulfuric acid.         \n\nNASA chose the 96-mile-wide  \n as Curiosity\u2019s landing site because readings from orbit identified the presence of clay minerals, which form in waters with a neutral pH. Curiosity\u2019s instruments indeed detected clays in the two mudstones, named John Klein and Cumberland.         \n\nThe clays appear to have formed at the lake bottom, not swept down from the walls of Gale Crater, strengthening the case that the lake water was not acidic.         \n\nCuriosity also measured carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen and phosphorus, elements that are critical for life on Earth, as well as iron and sulfur minerals that could have served as food for microbes.         \n\n\u201cIf there were microbial organisms around, I think they would have liked that environment,\u201d said  \n, a researcher at the  \n in Tucson and the lead author of  \n. On Earth, a class of such microbes known as  \n live in caves, hydrothermal vents and the deep underground.         \n\nAn impact, probably by an asteroid, excavated Gale Crater 3.6 billion to 3.8 billion years ago, and the John Klein and Cumberland mudstones formed out of sediments that subsequently accumulated in the crater. That is roughly the same age as rocks on Earth with the earliest signs of life.         \n\n\u201cYou can actually begin to line up in time what the Earth was doing and what Mars was doing,\u201d Dr. Grotzinger said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of cool.\u201d         \n\nThe Gale Crater lake was also of the same era as the sulfuric-acid-soaked rocks that Opportunity found. That suggests that as Mars dried out, conditions in different regions varied widely. \u201cThings have just gotten more complex than we thought,\u201d Dr. Grotzinger said.         \n\nCuriously, even though the rocks formed in a lake, soluble elements like sodium and calcium had not been washed away. That suggests that the climate even then was cold and arid, just not as cold and arid as it is today \u2014 perhaps an ice-covered lake.         \n\n\u201cWhat does it mean about the climate?\u201d Dr. Vaniman said. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019re all thinking about.\u201d         \n\nWhat has not been found yet is solid evidence for the carbon molecules known as organics that could serve as the building blocks of life. Such molecules are not always preserved in stone and are destroyed by radiation.         \n\nBy measuring the abundance of certain elements, a technique that has long been used to date Earth rocks,  \n, a professor of geochemistry at Caltech, was able to estimate that the sediments eroded from rocks 4.2 billion years old, give or take 350 million years, and that the rocks had been exposed at the surface for about 80 million years.         \n\nPreviously, planetary scientists estimated ages by counting craters \u2014 the older a surface, the greater the number of craters. Dr. Farley\u2019s numbers fit with expectations for the Gale Crater rocks \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s a nice demonstration this method could work,\u201d Dr. Farley said \u2014 and the dating technique could help locate rocks that have been exposed to radiation recently, raising the odds of finding organics, if they are present.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a big step forward for the exploration of life on Mars,\u201d Dr. Grotzinger said. \u201cWe\u2019re now exploring for that subset of environments can preserve organic carbon.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/10/science/space/on-mars-an-ancient-lake-and-perhaps-life.html", "date": "2013-12-09", "description": "Scientists have confirmed that the crater where a NASA rover landed last year contained a freshwater lake about 3.5 billion years ago, around the time that life is thought to have begun on Earth."}
