{"headline": "Visions of Drones Swarming U.S. Skies Hit Bipartisan Nerve", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The debate goes to the heart of a deeply rooted American suspicion about the government, the military and the surveillance state: the specter of drones streaking through the skies above American cities and towns, controlled by faceless bureaucrats and equipped to spy or kill.         \n\nThat Big Brother imagery \u2014 conjured up by Senator  \n of Kentucky during a more than 12-hour  \n this week \u2014 has animated a surprisingly diverse swath of political interests that includes mainstream civil liberties groups, Republican and Democratic lawmakers, conservative research groups, liberal activists and right-wing conspiracy theorists.         \n\nThey agree on little else. But Mr. Paul\u2019s soliloquy has tapped into a common anxiety on the left and the right about the dangers of unchecked government. And it has exposed fears about ultra-advanced technologies that are fueled by the increasingly fine line between science fiction and real life.         \n\nDrones have become the subject of urgent policy debates in Washington as lawmakers from both parties wrangle with  \n over their use to prosecute the fight against terrorism from the skies above countries like Pakistan and Yemen.         \n\nBut they are also a part of the popular culture \u2014 toys sold by Amazon; central plot points in \u201cHomeland\u201d and a dozen other television shows and movies; the subject of endless macabre humor, notably by The Onion; and even the subject of poetry. (\u201cOde to the MQ-9 Reaper,\u201d a serious work by the Brooklyn poet Joe Pan that was just published in the journal Epiphany,  \n as \u201cultra-cool & promo slick, a predatory dart\u201d that is \u201cas self-aware as silverware.\u201d)         \n\nBenjamin Wittes, a national security scholar at the Brookings Institution who has written extensively about drones, said he thought Mr. Paul\u2019s marathon was a \u201cdumb publicity stunt.\u201d But he said it had touched a national nerve because the technology, with its myriad implications, had already deeply penetrated the culture.         \n\n\u201cOver the last year or so, this thing that was the province of a small number of technologists and national security people has exploded into the larger public consciousness,\u201d Mr. Wittes said.         \n\nOn the right, Mr. Paul has become an overnight hero since his filibuster. Self-proclaimed defenders of the Constitution have shouted their approval on Twitter, using the hashtag #StandWithRand and declaring him to be a welcomed member of their less-is-better-government club.         \n\n\u201cThe day that Rand Paul ignited Liberty\u2019s Torch inside the beltway!\u201d one  \n activist wrote on Twitter. \u201cMay it never be extinguished!\u201d         \n\nBut even as the right swooned, the left did, too. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon \u2014 the only Democrat to join Mr. Paul\u2019s filibuster \u2014 said the unexpected array of political forces was just the beginning, especially as Congress and the public face the new technologies of 21st-century warfare.         \n\n\u201cI believe there is a new political movement emerging in this country that\u2019s shaking free of party moorings,\u201d Mr. Wyden said. \u201cAmericans want a better balance between protecting our security and protecting our liberty.\u201d         \n\nP. W. Singer, whose 2009 book \u201cWired for War: The Robotics Revolution and Conflict in the 21st Century\u201d anticipated the broad impact of drones, said he believed they had shaken up politics because they were \u201ca revolutionary technology, like the steam engine or the computer.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThe discussion doesn\u2019t fall along the usual partisan lines,\u201d he said. The dozen states that have passed laws restricting drones do not fall into conventional red-blue divisions, nor do the score of states competing to be the site of the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s test sites for drones.         \n\nThe serious issues raised by the government\u2019s lethal drones seem inextricably mixed with the ubiquitous appearance of the technology in art, commerce and satire.         \n\nA  \n by the Air Force Research Laboratory on \u201cmicro aerial vehicles\u201d shows a futuristic bee-size drone flying in an open window and taking out an enemy sniper with a miniature explosive payload. Since it was posted in 2009, it has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times and reposted all over the Web.         \n\nWhen  \n a six-inch model of the Predator, made by Maisto, in its toy section, people wrote politically charged mock reviews that became Internet hits: \u201cThis goes well,\u201d one reviewer wrote, \u201cwith the Maisto Extraordinary Rendition playset, by the way \u2014 which gives you all the tools you need to kidnap the family pet and take him for interrogation at a neighbor\u2019s house, where the rules of the  \n may not apply. Loads of fun!\u201d         \n\nSenator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, was not laughing Thursday when he took to the Senate floor to chastise Mr. Paul and defend the use of drones. In an  \n, Mr. McCain dismissed Mr. Paul and the other critics of drones as \u201cthe wacko birds on right and left that get the media megaphone.\u201d         \n\nBut the issue is larger than Mr. Paul, whose ambitions may include a run for the presidency in 2016. For many, Mr. Paul gave voice to the dangers they whisper about to anyone who will listen: that the government is too powerful to be left unchecked.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not merely the black helicopter crowd of the folks on the far right,\u201d said Mark Potok, a senior fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremist groups. \u201cWhat Rand Paul had to say about drones absolutely fired up conspiracy theorists on the left as well as the right.\u201d         \n\nHuman Rights Watch plans to join other groups next month in starting an effort called the  \n. The technology, fully autonomous weapons that are still at the drawing-board stage, would find and fire at their programmed targets without requiring a human being to pull the trigger.         \n\nSome national security experts find the campaign overwrought, but Mary Wareham, the advocacy director for the arms division of Human Rights Watch, noted that the Defense Department in November issued a  \n on autonomous weapons that recognized the challenges they pose.         \n\nAt the same time, there are people like Everett Wilkinson, a Tea Party organizer and self-proclaimed conspiracy theorist in Florida, who is hailing Mr. Paul as a \u201crock star for the Constitution.\u201d On Mr. Wilkinson\u2019s Web site,  \n, he warns that the United States government is building \u201cinternment camps\u201d for political dissidents. He is wary of what comes next.         \n\n\u201cFirst they said we are just going to use drones to observe stuff, and then they put Hellfire missiles on them,\u201d Mr. Wilkinson said. \u201cHow soon are we going to have drones overhead with Tasers on them?\u201d         \n\nIn Washington, Code Pink, a leftist group of antiwar activists, showed up with flowers and chocolates at Mr. Paul\u2019s Senate offices on Thursday to thank him for standing up against abuses of power. Known around Capitol Hill mainly for disrupting Congressional hearings, the group had found a new champion.         \n\n\u201cPeople say: \u2018Oh, my God, Code Pink is praising Rand Paul. Hell has frozen over!\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Medea Benjamin, a co-founder of the group. \u201cBut we were glued to C-Span to the bitter end of the filibuster. We were amazed to see the education of the public that was taking place, and that has never occurred before.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/09/us/politics/visions-of-drones-in-us-skies-touch-bipartisan-nerve.html", "date": "2013-03-08", "description": "The Big Brother imagery conjured up by Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky during a filibuster this week has animated a diverse swath of political interests."}
