{"headline": "Countries Seek Entrepreneurs From Silicon Valley", "body": "\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A bold new billboard looms over U.S. 101, the highway that runs through the heart of the global technology industry. \u201cH-1b problems?\u201d it reads. \u201cPivot to Canada.\u201d         \n\nThat sassy invitation is directed at the thousands of foreigners having trouble getting temporary visas, known as H-1b\u2019s, to work in the United States. Canada\u2019s new so-called start-up visa offers them the prospect of permanent residency and with it, the country\u2019s relatively low business taxes and public health insurance.         \n\nCanada is not alone in reaching out to foreign entrepreneurs. In a bid to create their own versions of Silicon Valley, Britain and Australia have dangled start-up visas like this too. Chile is even offering seed money to lure foreigners to come to Santiago and get their start-ups off the ground.         \n\nBut the seductions of this Silicon Valley are hard to resist for the men and women who dream of building the next Google (or at least being the next Google acquisition). This is where they want to be.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like being in Florence during the Renaissance,\u201d is how Xavier Lasa, a Spanish computer coder, put it recently. He sounded dead serious. He had come to Mountain View, just south of San Francisco, on a short-term business visa to join a technology incubator program called 500 Startups. He was building a tool for brands to advertise on the Web.         \n\nLike many foreign tech entrepreneurs angling to stay here, he had his eyes on Washington, not Ottawa. The landmark immigration bill that the full Senate is to take up next week includes a provision that Silicon Valley investors have pressed hard for: a new visa category for entrepreneurs who have persuaded American investors to back them with at least $100,000 in financing.         \n\nNever mind that immigrants don\u2019t need special visas to be entrepreneurial; research shows that they are far more likely than native-born Americans to start businesses. Start-up visas are an easy political sell, which also explains Canada\u2019s latest gamble.         \n\nWhen Canada\u2019s immigration minister, Jason T. Kenney, came to visit 500 Startups recently, on a gloriously sunny Friday afternoon, he got a taste of what attracts foreigners. Dave McClure, a co-founder of the incubator, took him straight to the wall-to-wall 12th-floor window.         \n\n\u201cFacebook is that way,\u201d Mr. McClure said, pointing to the 360-degree view. \u201cYou can see Apple over there.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s Sand Hill Road,\u201d he continued cheerfully, motioning toward the wide boulevard lined on both sides with big-name venture capital firms. \u201cStanford is just up that way.\u201d         \n\nThe room was full of foreign entrepreneurs, huddled over laptops or sketching out business plans on whiteboards.         \n\nJulian Garcia, a programmer from Chile who was building a tool for marketers to target potential customers by location, explained his view of the Valley. \u201cHere, you build something incredible, in two years, you get acquired.\u201d         \n\nAditya Sahay, the founder of a men\u2019s fashion site, from India, retorted, \u201cEven if you build something not incredible, you still get acquired \u2014 in four months!\u201d         \n\nMr. Kenney kept his game face on as Mr. McClure waxed about the attractions of the Valley. In an interview later, he said he was certain that some of the foreign entrepreneurs, uncertain about their immigration status in the United States, could be tempted by, say, Manitoba. He called them \u201ca captive audience,\u201d and said he hoped to take advantage of what could be a short window of opportunity for his country while Congress argues over how to fix its own immigration law.         \n\nThe new Canadian visa is not for tech entrepreneurs per se, but the venture capital requirements favor technology start-ups over more traditional immigrant businesses, like corner shops and restaurants. And the offer is far more generous than its American counterpart.         \n\nAnyone with one year of college and 75,000 Canadian dollars from an approved Canadian angel investor, or 200,000 Canadian dollars from an approved Canadian venture capitalist, can apply for the visa. Applicants need to be able to speak basic English or French. They need not prove they will create any jobs.         \n\nMr. Kenney said he believed that investors, rather than workers in his ministry, were more capable of vetting who would be good for his country.
