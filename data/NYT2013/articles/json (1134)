{"headline": "Escalating Crisis of Faith for Knicks\u2019 True Believers", "body": "\nMike Woodson slouched into his postgame, post-disaster news conference with the dour look of an undertaker with entirely too much business on his hands.         \n\n\u201cLook at the rebounding.\u201d His nose wrinkled with distaste. \u201cIt was 55-29. I mean, that is embarrassing.\u201d         \n\nYeah.         \n\nA few minutes later, Carmelo Anthony, looking natty and baffled, strolled to his locker, peered down at recorders and cameras and a sea of reporters and shook his head mournfully.         \n\n\u201cThe games we lose, it\u2019s obvious why we lose,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is a sense of inconsistency.\u201d         \n\nYeah, cubed.         \n\nThis is  \n basketball 2013, a perfectly enervating, draining, devitalizing and otherwise desultory hoops experience.         \n\nFor those wise enough to spend a warm winter-solstice day outside \u2014 or who decided, more profitably, to stare at their ceiling Saturday afternoon \u2014 allow me to break the news: The Knicks lost, 95-87, a game not remotely as close as the score indicates. I\u2019m tempted to call them \u201cmy\u201d Knicks, but using the personal pronoun amounts to an exercise in self-flagellation.         \n\nInjured and out of sync, the Memphis Grizzlies came tumbling into Madison Square Garden on a five-game losing streak and immediately took the look of men revived. The Knicks\u2019 big men were Gandhian in their lack of resistance. By mid-third quarter, I counted 15 unimpeded layups and dunks.         \n\nKnicks guards were gentlemanly, offering \u201cCould I take your hat and guide you to the hoop?\u201d defense. Mike Conley, the Grizzlies\u2019 point guard, would dribble down, give the vaguest of dekes and prance toward the hoop.         \n\nBeno Udrih, the Knicks\u2019 point guard, would toss his arms out, in the manner of a baseball umpire shouting, \u201cSafe!\u201d But, alas, he would neglect to move his feet.         \n\n\u201cBeno was slow tonight,\u201d Woodson said.         \n\nOh.         \n\nHere\u2019s the competitive advantage that comes with being a lifelong Knicks fan \u2014 you develop a hawk-eye for that inflection point when a losing season begins to feel inevitable. That train has pulled into the station.         \n\nWoodson has tried every manner of cure. Of late, he has played his best player, Anthony, more or less all the time. Anthony put in 55 minutes during an endless double-overtime affair in Milwaukee and another 41 minutes Saturday.         \n\nTyson Chandler, the bearded soul of this team, sat out many weeks with a broken leg. Then Woodson played him 37 minutes in his debut in Milwaukee and another 33 minutes Saturday.         \n\nChandler is a strapping fellow, but he looked drained afterward, offering a Zen whisper.         \n\n\u201cWe have our highs and we have our lows in one game,\u201d he said, mopping sweat off his face.         \n\nIt\u2019s hard to argue that Woodson should do without his two best players, as his job is on the line. But an N.B.A. season is a slog. Right now, Woodson calls to mind a Pony Express rider who has taken on too much debt. He is determined to flog his best horses until they expire.         \n\nWoodson\u2019s players fare poorly in early afternoon games. In their last noon start, they fell by 41 to the Boston Celtics, who opened the game with an 18-1 run.         \n\nThe Knicks\u2019 active night life often is fingered as the culprit. Rihanna, a recording artist, complained during last year\u2019s playoffs that J. R. Smith, the Knicks\u2019 herbaceous-loving shooting guard, was putting in such exuberant clubbing hours that he exhausted her.         \n\nSo Woodson played college coach Friday, gathering his players at an undisclosed hotel. The coach did not say if he padded around in his slippers making room checks.         \n\n\u201cHow was the curfew?\u201d I asked Metta World Peace. Wrapped in a towel before the game, he cocked his eyebrow. \u201cI didn\u2019t know we had a curfew.\u201d         \n\nTen p.m., I said.         \n\n\u201cOh.\u201d         \n\nHe turned and pulled a bottle out of his locker. \u201cKombucha, the wonder drink, man. It\u2019s great,\u201d he said. \u201cThey say it has natural alcohol. For real, man.\u201d         \n\nThe conversation trailed off in an indeterminate direction.         \n\nThe team pillow party might be counted as a modified success. The Knicks ended the first quarter behind, 25-22.         \n\nThe Knicks\u2019 defense lacks inspiration, not to mention lateral movement. But offense goes to the heart of the Knicks\u2019 malady. They rank near the bottom of the league in points scored.         \n\nBefore the game, I watched Grizzlies power forward Zach Randolph take warm-ups. At 6 feet 9 inches and 260 pounds, he\u2019s a sasquatch of a man with a butter-smooth jumper. He hit 22 of 26 shots from the corner.         \n\nNot long after, the Knicks\u2019 Iman Shumpert came out. He had worked weights until sweaty. Then he began to shoot. Clank. Clank. Clank. Short, long, to the side. It\u2019s like watching a little kid tossing rocks at a distant bottle.         \n\nHe played 17 minutes and finished 1 for 7, with 2 points, the shooting guard who isn\u2019t. After missing badly, he came jogging to the bench, and Woodson averted his face, as if searching for lint on the scorer\u2019s table.         \n\nLast season, the Knicks offered a fluid point-guard offense, with lots of 3-point shots. On Saturday, they tried a shooting cure, taking 22 shots from 3-point range. They hit six.         \n\nSmith was on fire Saturday, as opposed to the rest of 2013. After shooting 5 for 17 against Milwaukee, he typed out a tweet: \u201cLol 17 threes tho!\u201d         \n\nThen he added: \u201cTrust me give me that chance again I\u2019ll shoot it again.\u201d         \n\nYou go, dawg.         \n\nThe Knicks made a run, fueled by Grizzlies ineptness. But many fans had already turned, amid numbing techno music and inane electronic imprecations to \u201cGET LOUD!\u201d Being a Knicks fan can feel like belonging to a particularly annoying cargo cult.         \n\nAfterward, Woodson spoke of the team \u201cbeing in a hole.\u201d You wanted to nod and ask where was the ladder out.
