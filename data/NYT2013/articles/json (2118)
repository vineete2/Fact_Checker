{"headline": "The Long Goodbye", "body": "\n\u201cNew York was no mere city,\u201d  \n wrote in her landmark 1967 essay, \u201cGoodbye to All That,\u201d explaining why she abandoned her adopted home of New York, seemingly for good, at the age of 29. \u201cIt was instead an infinitely romantic notion, the mysterious nexus of all love and money and power, the shining and perishable dream itself.\u201d         \n\nMs. Didion, who was originally from California, did more than just capture, and explode, the enduring image of the young writer chucking it all to make it in New York. She spawned a new literary clich\u00e9: the not-quite-so-young writer beating a hasty retreat from the city, but transforming the surrender into a literary triumph via a \u201cGoodbye to All That, Redux\u201d essay.         \n\nThe literature may be thin when it comes to \u201cSee ya, Chicago\u201d or \u201cLater, Los Angeles\u201d odes, but ever since Ms. Didion  \n 46 years ago, the \u201cGoodbye New York\u201d essay has become a de rigueur career move for aspiring belle-lettrists. It is a theme that has been explored continuously over the years by the likes of Meghan Daum in  \n and Luc Sante in The  \n.         \n\nLately, the \u201cGoodbye\u201d essay has found renewed life, as a new generation of writers works out its love-hate relationship with the city in public fashion. Recently, opinion-makers like Andrew Sullivan and David Byrne have scribbled much-discussed New York-is-over essays; literary-minded Generation Y writers have bid not-so-fond farewells to the city on blogs like Gawker and The Cut; and a dozen-plus writers, including Dani Shapiro and Maggie Estep, published elegies to their ambivalence toward New York in  \n an anthology published last month.         \n\n\u201cIf you can make it here, you can make it anywhere, the song goes,\u201d Mr. Sullivan wrote in a Sunday Times of London  \n last week, explaining his decision to flee New York after only a year and return to Washington. \u201cBut why would anyone want to make it here? The human beings are stacked on top of one another in vast towers that create dark, narrow caverns in between. Gridlocked traffic competes with every conceivable noise and every imaginable variation on the theme of human rage and impatience.\u201d         \n\nNew York, I can\u2019t quit you. Or maybe I can.         \n\nOn first glance, contemporary entries to the genre tend to follow the same arc as Ms. Didion\u2019s essay. Basically, it is a classic femme (or homme) fatale story, with New York as siren, New York as lover-substitute, an eight-million-headed stand-in for those sexy bad-news types we all fall for, to our peril, when we are young.         \n\n\u201cNo man could compete, in my mind, with the lure of a summer night in Greenwich Village,\u201d writes Hope Edelman in \u201cYou Are Here,\u201d her contribution to the anthology.         \n\nTo Ann Friedman, whose essay \u201cWhy I\u2019m Glad I Quit New York at Age 24\u201d recently ran in the  \n blog The Cut, New York is not just a guy, it\u2019s that guy. \u201cI\u2019ve always been partial to the friendly guy who doesn\u2019t know how hot he really is (Chicago) or the surprisingly intelligent, sexy stoner (Los Angeles),\u201d Ms. Friedman wrote, \u201cas opposed to the dude who thinks he\u2019s top of the list, king of the hill, A-number-one.\u201d         \n\nThe New York-you-broke-my-heart essay has become such a trope for young female writers that  \n recently asked, \u201cIs Dumping New York City a \u2018Girl Thing?\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\n(Apparently not. Mr. Sullivan also invoked the romantic-love theme in a recent blog post, describing New York as his \u201cmistress,\u201d though he felt \u201cmarried to Washington,\u201d his once and future home. And in a 2010 exit essay on The New York Times blog  \n, Christopher Solomon, who came from the Pacific Northwest, wrote: \u201cOh, I pursued you. We went to the opera, to plays, to gritty little restaurants in Queens. You \u2014 the city \u2014 were always my date. But you never belonged to me. Eventually you, too, moved on, taking your buzzing neon promise of fame to the next newcomer.\u201d)         \n\nBy framing the relationship as a love affair, it makes the inevitable breakup with the literary capital seem less like a career failure than a coming to the senses after a youthful infatuation.         \n\n\u201cIn my early twenties, I felt that my life could be one big experiment, and in my mid-twenties I am coming to terms with the fact that no, my life is actually  \n,\u201d wrote Chloe Caldwell in her anthology entry, \u201cLeaving My Groovy Lifestyle.\u201d         \n\nIn putting it so, Ms. Caldwell echoed Ms. Didion\u2019s description of how she rationalized the move that she and her husband made to Los Angeles (they returned to New York in the 1980s): \u201cI talk about how difficult it would be for us to \u2018afford\u2019 to live in New York right now, about how much \u2018space\u2019 we need. All I mean is that I was very young in New York, and that at some point the golden rhythm was broken, and I am not that young anymore.\u201d         \n\nFor Ms. Didion, in other words, money was simply an excuse. The reality was, in the relatively cheap New York of the 1960s, even a Vogue junior staff member like her \u2014 making $70 a week \u2014 could secure a centrally located Manhattan apartment with a view of, she thought, the Brooklyn Bridge (\u201cIt turned out the bridge was the Triborough,\u201d she dryly amended) and pay for taxis to parties where she might see \u201cnew faces.\u201d Sure, the early days were tough \u2014 \u201csome weeks I had to charge food at Bloomingdale\u2019s gourmet shop in order to eat,\u201d she wrote. But in general, she could afford to hang around long enough to determine when she had stayed \u201ctoo long at the Fair.\u201d In sum, she could afford to fall out of love with the city slowly.         \n\nNot so for the would-be Didions of today. In their New York, the nice apartments with the bridge views tend to go to the underwriters of bond issues, not to the writers of essays for literary anthologies. The unaffordability of New York on a writer\u2019s budget is a theme running through several contemporary variations on the theme.
