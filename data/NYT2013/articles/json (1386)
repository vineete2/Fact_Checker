{"headline": "Current Laws May Offer Little Shield Against Drones, Senators Are Told", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Targeted killings have made  \n controversial, but a new class of tiny aircraft in the United States \u2014  \n \u2014 could engage in targeted snooping that existing laws are inadequate to address, witnesses and members of the Senate Judiciary Committee said in a  \n on Wednesday.         \n\nThe drones, or unmanned aerial systems, have already helped the police find missing people and county planners measure the growth of a landfill. But they could also be used by drug dealers, pedophiles and nosy neighbors, the witnesses and a senator said.         \n\nSurveillance by government is limited by the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, and snooping by corporations and individuals is covered by privacy law and common law. But these were not written with drones in mind. The issue has taken on new urgency as the  \n prepares to set forth rules for drones\u2019 commercial use and as prices for the aircraft drop. Many states are considering legislation, but Congress is only beginning to consider the problem.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s very little in American privacy law that would limit the use of drones for surveillance,\u201d said one witness, Ryan Calo, an assistant professor at the University of Washington School of Law. \u201cDrones drive down the cost of surveillance considerably. We worry that the incidence of surveillance will go up.\u201d         \n\nBut Benjamin Miller, of the sheriff\u2019s office in Mesa County, Colo., who flies a two-pound, battery-powered six-rotor helicopter drone that he placed on the table in front of him, said his department had used a drone equipped with a thermal camera to investigate arson at a historic church, which helped firefighters identify hot spots and determine which direction the fire had traveled through the building. The sheriff\u2019s office also used a drone for Mesa County\u2019s annual survey of the landfill where it buries its garbage (to determine how quickly it is filling up), for about $200. The usual cost was nearly $10,000, Mr. Miller said.         \n\nThe sheriff\u2019s office operates its drones under a permit from the F.A.A., which requires that the aircraft stay under 400 feet and fly only in daylight. The rules are similar to the ones for radio-controlled model airplanes, which the drones resemble, although they have refinements like sophisticated autopilots, GPS navigation systems and stabilized cameras. Use of such drones by police departments and government agencies is still extremely limited. And commercial use \u2014 that is, a company flying a drone and being paid for it \u2014 is not yet legal.         \n\nThe F.A.A. is to have rules in place for commercial use, including how to prevent collisions, by September 2015. But already there are thousands of drones in the nation\u2019s skies.         \n\nDrones could be outfitted to read license plates and recognize faces, said Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee. \u201cJust because the government may comply with the Constitution does not mean they should be able to constantly surveil, like Big Brother,\u201d he said.         \n\nHe warned that criminals could use drones because they were so inexpensive and capable, and that news reporters could use them in an intrusive way.         \n\nThe hearing came the day after an unlikely pair on the House side, Representative  \n, Republican of Texas, and Representative  \n, Democrat of Massachusetts, introduced a bill to limit data-gathering by drones.         \n\nThey said one problem was that the F.A.A., which would eventually be the licensing agency for those drones for which pilots needed licenses, had no jurisdiction in privacy, nor much expertise in the area. Mr. Barton\u2019s and Mr. Markey\u2019s bill would require licensed drone pilots to say publicly what their drones were doing and how the information would be used, among other protections. It is not yet clear which drones the F.A.A. will require licenses for, although people flying many of the smallest ones are unlikely to need them.         \n\nSome experts think the threat from the government is bigger than any from private use. \u201cIf it\u2019s my neighbor that wants to snoop on me, he can\u2019t put me in jail,\u201d said Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the  \n program at the Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cIf Google or Amazon wants to use drone surveillance to figure out my market preferences, the worst thing that happens is I get marketed stuff I don\u2019t need.\u201d         \n\nShowing the public uneasiness over the new technology, one young protester at the hearing was led away by Capitol police after she stood up and declared, \u201cDrones are responsible for the death of people in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Yemen!\u201d Another protester held a sign that said, \u201c1984.\u201d         \n\nAs Ms. Goitein observed, \u201cThe country can be divided into people who think this is horrifying and people who think this is neat.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/21/us/politics/senate-panel-weighs-privacy-concerns-over-use-of-drones.html", "date": "2013-03-20", "description": "There is little in privacy law that would limit the use of drones for surveillance in the United States because the laws were not written with the aircraft in mind, witnesses said at a hearing."}
