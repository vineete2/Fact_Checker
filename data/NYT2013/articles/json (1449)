But these simple homes also reveal why another huge exodus would be unlikely: the bulk of them are empty.         \n\nAll across Mexico\u2019s ruddy central plains, most of the people who could go north already have. In a region long regarded as a bellwether of illegal  \n \u2014 where the flow of migrants has often seemed never-ending \u2014 the streets are wind-whipped and silent. Homes await returning families, while dozens of schools have closed because of a lack of students. Here in El Cargadero, a once-thriving farm community of 3,000, only a few hundred people remain, at most.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like it used to be,\u201d said Fermin Saldivar Ure\u00f1o, 45, an avocado farmer whose 13 brothers and sisters are all in California. \u201cI have three kids, my parents had 14. There just aren\u2019t as many people to go.\u201d         \n\nAs Congress  \n a sweeping overhaul of immigration, many lawmakers say they are deeply concerned that providing a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million immigrants living illegally in the United States would mean only more illegal immigration.         \n\nThey blame the  \nthat President Ronald Reagan approved in 1986 for the human wave that followed, and they fear a repeat if Congress rewards lawbreakers and creates an incentive for more immigrants to sneak across the border.         \n\n\u201cThe big problem with immigration is convincing people in the country that it won\u2019t turn into a 1986 endgame,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who is in the bipartisan group of senators working on a bill.         \n\nBut past experience and current trends in both Mexico and the United States suggest that legalization would not lead to a sudden flood of illegal immigration on the scale of what occurred after 1986. Long-running surveys of migrants from Mexico found that work, not the potential to gain legal status, was the main cause of increased border crossings in the 1990s and 2000s. And as Mr. Saldivar points out, times have changed.         \n\nThe American economy is no longer flush with jobs. The border is  \n. And in Mexico the birthrate has fallen precipitously, while the people who left years ago have already sent their immediate relatives across, or started American families of their own.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new Mexico, it\u2019s a new United States, and the interaction between them is new,\u201d said Katherine Donato, a sociologist at Vanderbilt University who specializes in immigration. As for Congressional action spurring a surge of illegal crossings, she added: \u201cYou\u2019re just not going to see this massive interest. You don\u2019t have the supply of people. You have a dangerous trip that costs a lot more money, and there has been strong growth all over Latin America. So if people in Central America are disenfranchised and don\u2019t have jobs, as was the case in Mexico three or four decades ago, they might decide to go south.\u201d         \n\nOf course, hundreds of thousands of people, from all over Mexico and other parts of the world, still try to reach the United States each year, and the country\u2019s magnetism will partly depend on the details of what Congress approves. Who will be eligible? How long will they have to wait, and what barriers will lawmakers erect to prevent new immigrants from entering illegally and finding work?         \n\nSome scholars argue that granting any form of legal status encourages illegal migration because it creates a more settled immigrant class, attracting other relatives. \u201cIf that person is a green card holder, the power of that network would seem to be significantly stronger,\u201d said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the  \n in Washington, which advocates reduced immigration.         \n\nMany lawmakers, particularly Republicans, see the 1986 law \u2014 the  \n\u2014 as the prime example of what can go wrong.         \n\nBilled as a sweeping effort to halt illegal immigration, it gave legal status to around 2.7 million immigrants through two programs: one for farm workers and another for immigrants who had been living in the United States since 1982. For the first few years after it passed, illegal crossings fell because migrants who had once entered the United States illegally suddenly had papers allowing them to come and go at will.         \n\nBut by 1990, the flaws began to show. The documentation requirements for agricultural workers were loose enough to allow for widespread fraud, encouraging people to cross the still relatively unprotected border and apply.
