{"headline": "Younger Generations Lag Parents in Wealth-Building", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Pearl Brady has a stable job with good benefits and holds two degrees, a bachelor\u2019s and a master\u2019s. But despite her best efforts, she has no savings, and worries that it will be years before she manages to start putting away money for a house, children and eventually retirement.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m in that extremely nervous category,\u201d said Ms. Brady, 28, a Brooklynite who works for a union. \u201cI know how much money I\u2019m going to be making for the near term. I hope in my 30s and 40s to be able to save, but I have no idea how. It\u2019s scary.\u201d         \n\nMs. Brady has plenty of company. A  \n finds that Ms. Brady and her peers up to roughly age 40 have accrued less wealth than their parents did at the same age, even as the average wealth of Americans has doubled over the last quarter-century.         \n\nBecause wealth compounds over long periods of time \u2014 a dollar saved 10 years ago is worth much more than a dollar saved today \u2014 young adults probably face less secure futures for decades down the road, and even shakier retirements.         \n\n\u201cIn this country, the expectation is that every generation does better than the previous generation,\u201d said Caroline Ratcliffe, an author of the study. \u201cThis is no longer the case. This generation might have less.\u201d The authors said the situation facing young Americans might be unprecedented.         \n\nA broad range of economic factors has conspired to suppress wealth-building for younger American workers; the trend predates the Great Recession. Younger Americans are facing stagnant pay \u2014 the median income, when adjusted for inflation, has declined since its 1999 peak \u2014 as well as a housing collapse and soaring  \n debt.         \n\nIn interviews, a half-dozen young adults \u2014 men and women, with families and single, in a broad range of industries \u2014 described economic conditions that left them just barely keeping their heads above water.         \n\nMs. Brady, for instance, earns about $1,800 a month in take-home pay. But she paid for her undergraduate and graduate education in part with loans, which cost her about $400 a month. She also is trying to pay down her credit card debt, which requires about $500 a month. After food, rent and living expenses, there is little left over.         \n\nLooking forward, she said, it seemed hard to imagine building a nest egg. \u201cRealistically, my income will go up, but not at a rate that\u2019s going to match my expenses,\u201d Ms. Brady said. \u201cI feel like every step forward I take, it\u2019s three steps back.\u201d         \n\nChuck Ross, 31, has a master\u2019s in economics and at one point built up a $12,000 nest egg from investing. But he lives in Wichita, Kan., where jobs in his field are few. He works at a large chain restaurant and is struggling with $40,000 in student loans. \u201cMy dad works for himself,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s always joking about how he\u2019ll work until he dies. We laugh, but for me, that\u2019s becoming more and more of a thought.\u201d         \n\nOthers said they had put their money into a home only to fall into  \n, or were struggling to pay for child care.         \n\nStrong and sustained job and wage growth would cure many of the ills facing younger workers, experts said. But their delayed or diminished wealth accumulation might still have a lasting impact on their finances.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of a tipping-point moment,\u201d said Signe-Mary McKernan, an author of the study from the Urban Institute, a nonprofit Washington research institution. \u201cIf we don\u2019t address it today, they might never catch up.\u201d         \n\nFor instance, the researchers said, if a person delayed the purchase of a home to age 40 instead of buying at age 30, that might result in a $42,000 loss in home equity by the time she reaches 60, given trends in wealth accumulation over the past few decades.         \n\nThe Urban Institute study is one of many to show something of a perfect storm of economic trends battering younger workers. One is the collapse of the housing bubble. Young people who bought homes as prices started to decline in 2006 are often underwater on their mortgages today. But now that prices have fallen sharply and interest rates are remarkably low, many other young adults are locked out of the market because credit standards are tougher.
