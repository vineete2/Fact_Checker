{"headline": "Night Falls, and 5Pointz, a Graffiti Mecca, Is Whited Out in Queens", "body": "\nGraffiti is often denounced as vandalism, but the deliriously festooned, sprawling warehouses at the western edge of Queens rose far above that. Blanketed with giddy images, drawing street artists from around the world,  \n was a decades-old legal haven considered both a  \n and a semi-rebellious statement in a city some feel is growing too antiseptic. \u201cSave  \n,\u201d the infamous British street artist Banksy urged in his final message to New Yorkers, after he wrapped his monthlong spree clandestinely decorating the city\u2019s streets in October.         \n\nBut early Tuesday, under the cover of night, painters quietly blanketed much of the walls of 5Pointz with whitewash, erasing the work of hundreds and seemingly putting the final nail in the long battle between the building\u2019s owners, who plan to erect luxury apartments, and the artists who fought to save it.         \n\n\u201cThis is the biggest rag and disrespect in the history of graffiti,\u201d said a teary-eyed Marie Cecile Flaguel, a spokeswoman for the group behind 5Pointz, which sprang like a rainbow from the gray sidewalks near Jackson Avenue in Long Island City. \u201cHe\u2019s painted over the work of at least 1,500 artists.\u201d         \n\nThe owner of the buildings, Jerry Wolkoff, however, said painting over the artwork was the humane thing to do. A recent order by a federal judge allows him to move forward with his plans to demolish the buildings by year\u2019s end, and, he said, watching the art-covered walls be pulled down piece by piece would be \u201ctorture.\u201d         \n\nHe also wanted to avoid a confrontation, adding that there would be a 60-foot-high wall near the new towers where graffiti painters can work again.         \n\n\u201cI am telling you, I did not like what they did \u2014 I loved what they did,\u201d said Mr. Wolkoff, who bought the buildings in 1971 and plans to build high-rise towers in their stead. \u201cI cried this morning, I swear to you.\u201d         \n\nYet many supporters of 5Pointz, which became so well established that tourists flocked to it by the busload, saw the clandestine erasing as a cruel, vindictive move.         \n\n\u201cThe fact that they destroyed the art before they razed the building, it\u2019s a really big slap in the face,\u201d said Eric Felisbret, an expert on street art and the author of \u201cGraffiti New York.\u201d \u201cSo many people put so much passion and energy into it.\u201d         \n\nThough there are other spots in New York City where graffiti artists could legally work, Mr. Felisbret said, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that was as large and that big of a draw internationally\u201d as 5Pointz.         \n\nForty years ago, after buying the buildings, which were mostly abandoned at the time, Mr. Wolkoff leased the space to a company that made record player accessories, then eight-track tapes and then CD covers before moving out in the early 1990s.         \n\nCasting about for new tenants, Mr. Wolkoff rented studios to artists for a few hundred dollars a month. Around that time he was also approached by a man who removed graffiti from buildings around the city, and wanted to know if the painters could use Mr. Wolkoff\u2019s walls as canvases. Liking their work, Mr. Wolkoff gave them more and more space. In 2002, a graffiti artist named Meres One took the endeavor over, becoming its curator and christening it 5Pointz.         \n\nFive stories high, the buildings occupied most of a city block, a playful, wacky visual counterpoint to the solemn low-slung MoMA PS 1 site across the street. The canary yellow walls were covered with constantly changing artwork \u2014 Brobdingnagian bubble letters, colorful cartoons and meticulously wrought images created by painters from France, Italy, Japan and beyond. Stepping into 5Pointz\u2019s interior courtyard was like plunging into a lurid fever dream.         \n\nThough street art is meant to be temporary, 5Pointz became known as a graffiti museum. And the medium itself, once considered a symbol of urban unraveling, became a sought after gallery-worthy commodity, with work from street artists like Banksy commanding millions of dollars. Which is one of the reasons the whitewashing of 5Pointz\u2019s walls was greeted with such vociferous dismay. \u201cWhat?! What did they do?!\u201d cried a tour guide named Hans Von Rittern, as he raced out of a tour bus early Tuesday, his arms wide, his face crumpling as soon as he caught sight of Ms. Flaguel. They embraced tightly and wept.
