{"headline": "China Seen in Push to Gain Technology Insights", "body": "\nSHENZHEN, China \u2014 A government-financed research institute in the Pearl River Delta here boasts an impressive range of specialties, from robotics to nanomedicine to magnetic resonance imaging.         \n\nBut not all the cutting edge developments may be the result of indigenous innovation, according to American prosecutors, who last month  \n at the New York University School of Medicine with taking bribes to share research findings with their real employers: the Shenzhen institute and a separate Shanghai medical technology company.         \n\nThough considerable attention has been focused on  \n, the institute is at the vanguard of a related push to bolster China\u2019s competitiveness by acquiring overseas technology directly from Chinese scientists working in the United States and other developed countries, say American officials and analysts. Those scientists are heavily recruited to return to China or, in some instances, to share their knowledge while remaining overseas, according to the federal court case and a book released last month by three experts who do China research for the United States government.         \n\nIn advance of a summit meeting in California later this week between President Obama and President Xi Jinping of China, the two countries agreed to hold regular meetings on the issues of cybersecurity and commercial espionage. But there is no sign yet of what those discussions might accomplish.         \n\nThe authors of the new book, \u201cChinese Industrial Espionage,\u201d say that technology transfer is an official policy at all levels of the Communist Party and the state. It often takes place in a legal gray area, since laws governing technology transfer can be vague or nonexistent. The authors warn that the United States and other nations need to acknowledge the extent of the Chinese campaign, which they say far exceeds those of other countries and threatens American competitiveness.         \n\nThey contend that the scale of China\u2019s efforts to gather overseas technology is so immense that the National Counterintelligence Executive, a federal agency, has considered issuing separate annual reports each year: one for China and one for the rest of the world.         \n\n\u201cChina is in a different league altogether, exceeding the international norm not just in scale, the number and variety of transfer venues, the moral agnosticism of its practitioners, and the degree of government support,\u201d the authors, William C. Hannas, James Mulvenon and Anna B. Puglisi, said in written answers to questions. \u201cIt\u2019s an entire mind-set.\u201d         \n\nChina\u2019s strategies range from setting up science parks for Chinese returnees to persuading foreign companies to open research centers in China, they said.         \n\nA private intelligence company in the Washington area, Defense Group Inc., which employs Mr. Mulvenon, says the government-financed center that the N.Y.U. scientists are accused of being part of, the  \n, recruits overseas Chinese with technical knowledge and \u201chas sought to develop collaborative relationships with foreign companies and research organizations which display high potential for technology transfer.\u201d         \n\nA spokeswoman for the Shenzhen center said it was investigating the accusations in the N.Y.U. case. A lawyer for Yudong Zhu, an associate professor in the N.Y.U. radiology department and the lead scientist charged, said the government \u201chas drawn some erroneous conclusions from some of the evidence they have observed\u201d and that Mr. Zhu did not work for the Shanghai company.         \n\nThe Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property  \n in May that technology theft amounted to a loss of more than $300 billion a year, the equivalent of total annual United States exports to Asia. \u201cVirtually every sector and technology is attacked,\u201d the commission said.         \n\n\u201cNational industrial policy goals in China encourage IP theft, and an extraordinary number of Chinese in business and government entities are engaged in this practice,\u201d said the report by the commission, which was led by Dennis C. Blair, a former director of national intelligence, and Jon M. Huntsman Jr., a former ambassador to China.         \n\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry and the State Council, China\u2019s cabinet, declined to comment for this article. In early May, the Commerce Ministry denied accusations by the United States Trade Representative that China was weak on enforcing intellectual property rights. \u201cThe Chinese government attaches great importance to intellectual property protection and has made great progress in areas like intellectual property legislation and enforcement,\u201d it said.         \n\nCases like the one at N.Y.U. of overseas Chinese scientists and scholars accused of secretly transferring technical information are considered rare, especially given that the number of Chinese students going abroad reached 400,000 last year. But the growing emphasis in the United States on technology theft by China has made some Chinese-Americans and overseas Chinese fearful of undue persecution. They point to the fiasco of the  \n, in which a Chinese-American scientist was wrongly accused by federal officials of stealing classified nuclear-related documents.
