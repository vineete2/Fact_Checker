{"headline": "A Getaway Apartment, in Your Own Building", "body": "\nFreddie Gershon lives with his wife, Myrna, and his dog in a penthouse duplex with a terrace in Midtown East. The space is plenty big, he concedes \u2014 6,500 square feet.         \n\nBut apparently not quite big enough. Last month, Mr.  \n, the chief executive of Music Theatre International, a licensing agency, closed on some additional real estate in his co-op: a one-bedroom 1,000-square-foot unit on the fourth floor.         \n\n\u201cI have reached a point in my life where I want to write,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a book in mind, and I wanted a sanctuary that didn\u2019t require me to get dressed and go outside. I wanted to go to the passenger or service elevator and just go to a different floor.\u201d         \n\nMr. Gershon said he had tried working at home. \u201cBut then I\u2019d hear the phones,\u201d he said. \u201cOr I\u2019d get distracted by the view of the river.\u201d         \n\nNew Yorkers who need more space, but would rather not move, generally try to make a deal with the departing next-door neighbor \u2014 oh, for a departing next-door neighbor \u2014 or with the people who live directly above or below. Deal done, they get busy punching through walls and ceilings to combine their holdings into a single flowing residence.         \n\nBut some, like Mr. Gershon, while they are eager for more room, really don\u2019t want that room to be right in the next room. They\u2019d prefer something that\u2019s an elevator ride or a few flights of stairs removed from the mother ship. A noncontiguous apartment \u2014 typically, a studio or a one-bedroom \u2014 whether used as a writing or an art studio, an office, a man-cave or an escape hatch, allows its owners or renters to be so near and yet so far.         \n\nThis form of branching out may be happening a bit more these days because the market is improving, making potential buyers less skittish. It also helps that inventory for these smaller apartments is deeper than for larger units.         \n\n\u201cI tend to observe this pattern when, like now, markets are ticking upward,\u201d said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the real estate appraisal firm Miller Samuel. \u201cPeople are more aggressive in asserting their own quirks, more confident. It\u2019s almost a whimsical purchase. It\u2019s like: \u2018Oh, there\u2019s a one-bedroom for sale on the fifth floor. Maybe we should buy it,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to enhance the enjoyment of living in a particular building.\u201d         \n\nIn some prewar buildings where maids\u2019 rooms were laid out on a separate floor, Mr. Miller said, \u201cpeople buy them and turn them into a study or additional storage space or me-time rooms.\u201d In one co-op on East End Avenue, he came across \u201cside-by-side maids\u2019 rooms combined and made into a private gym for a resident, with a shower and a wine cellar.\u201d         \n\nBut, as he points out, the person who buys or rents a noncontiguous apartment isn\u2019t doing so to have more \u201cwalking-around\u201d terrain. This is space meant to serve a discrete function, to help fulfill a specific fantasy: writing the Great American Novel, for example, or sculpturing a masterpiece \u2014 activities that, given all the usual interruptions, would be impossible to engage in at home.         \n\nAnd unlike most real estate fantasies, it doesn\u2019t command a premium. \u201cLet\u2019s say you have a 1,500-square-foot apartment on the seventh floor and buy a 500-square-foot studio on the third floor,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cThe aggregate total of noncontiguous studio plus original apartment would be a lot less costly than buying a 2,000-square-foot unit.\u201d         \n\nThat is, if you could even  \n a 2,000 square-foot unit. \u201cThere are now twice as many studios and one-bedrooms available in  \n as there are three or more bedrooms,\u201d said Beth Fisher, a senior managing director of the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group. \u201cThe ultratight market is forcing buyers to request combinations or seek out noncontiguous apartments.\u201d         \n\nSix months ago, soon after their twins were born, Catherine and William Ebert bought the 300-square-foot studio across the hall from their three-bedroom co-op on the Upper West Side.         \n\n\u201cIt had come on the market and I thought, \u2018Wouldn\u2019t this be so great,\u2019 because I work at home, and with the twins that\u2019s hard to do,\u201d said Ms. Ebert, an interior designer. \u201cI\u2019d be close by, but I could have some peace and quiet and get stuff done and not be bothered.\u201d Her husband, a lawyer, was also looking forward to having a place to do a couple of hours of work without having to repair to the office.
