{"headline": "Mussels, Difficult? A Myth Without Legs", "body": "\nI have a friend who makes kimchi from scratch, can produce molecular-cuisine-inspired foams and gel\u00e9es and has even deep-fried an entire Thanksgiving turkey on his petite patio.         \n\nBut steaming a pot of mussels? Now that intimidates him.         \n\nThat cooking mussels is a scary proposition is an all-too-common misconception. Mussels are not only inexpensive and highly sustainable, but they are also one of the easiest proteins you can make, once you get to know them.         \n\nThese days, most of the mussels you can buy have been farmed, which means they come pre-cleaned and ready for the pot. Unlike their wild cousins, farmed mussels are not sandy or gritty, and arrive practically if not entirely beardless.         \n\nAll you have to do is give them a quick rinse under the tap, then check to make sure they are all alive before they go into the pot. Dead mussels will gape open, and won\u2019t respond if you knock their shells together or try to squeeze them closed. If they close up somewhat, they\u2019re still living. Any that don\u2019t react at all should be tossed.         \n\nIf you\u2019re lucky enough to find wild mussels and don\u2019t mind putting in a little more work, snap them up immediately. Wild mussels have a deeper, more saline and mineral flavor, but they will need a more thorough cleaning. And they often have beards as thick and long as a Brooklynite\u2019s, which will need plucking.         \n\nTo clean them, first use your fingers or a knife to pull out their beards. Then soak the mussels in a bowl of cold water for about 20 minutes. This lets the bivalves expel any grit. Finally, scrub them under the tap.         \n\nMost recipes call for steaming mussels in a mix of wine and aromatics. I also like to use the steam from saut\u00e9ed vegetables, which turns mussels into a one-pot meal. Here I\u2019ve saut\u00e9ed cauliflower with chiles and shallots as the steaming bed. But other vegetables with a high water content will also work: cabbage and mushrooms as the winter approaches, corn and tomatoes in summer.         \n\nAs with most salty sea creatures, a bit of acid makes them shine. In this recipe, a squeeze of lime does just that.         \n\nYou\u2019ll end up with something savory, tangy and slightly spicy from the chiles. And there\u2019s nothing scary about that.
