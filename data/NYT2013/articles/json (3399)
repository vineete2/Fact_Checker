{"headline": "Who Made That Built-In Eraser?", "body": "\nIn 1858, a stationer named Hymen Lipman patented a newfangled pencil with a rubber plug embedded in one end of its wood shaft. An entrepreneur named Joseph Reckendorfer guessed that the pencil-plus-eraser would become a blockbuster product and bought the patent from Lipman for $100,000, about $2 million in today\u2019s dollars. Had that patent held up, Reckendorfer might have become a titan of industry. By the 1920s, almost all of the pencils sold in America included erasers.         \n\nBut unfortunately for Reckendorfer, the Supreme Court ruled in 1875 that the eraser-tipped pencil didn\u2019t count as a legitimate invention. \u201cIn the eyes of the court, all that Lipman had done was combine an eraser, which was a known technology, with the pencil, which was a known technology,\u201d says Henry Petroski, author of \u201cThe Pencil,\u201d a book on the history and design of the tool. Because Reckendorfer lost the case, companies like A. W. Faber could use Lipman\u2019s design without paying any royalties.         \n\nNearly 60 years after Lipman\u2019s innovation, the rubber-tipped pencil became a hit. So much so that in 1915 it inspired a sermon by the Rev. Silas Delmar Conger, who praised the built-in eraser as a symbol of American resilience and pluck. \u201cTo keep our past failures ever before us would cause us to continue to fail,\u201d he said. So \u201ctake out your pencil, rub out the mark and start over again.\u201d         \n\nPetroski says that even though Americans expect their pencils to come equipped with erasers, this design failed to catch on in many countries. \u201cIf you\u2019re traveling outside the United States, you may notice that it\u2019s hard to find a pencil with an eraser on it,\u201d he says.         \n\nSo does our pencil say something about us as a people? A writer for a 1922 issue of American Stationer and Office Outfitter thought so: \u201cThroughout Europe, the rubber-tipped pencil is practically unknown,\u201d they wrote. \u201cIt may be that foreigners consider themselves less apt to make mistakes than the happy-go-lucky Americans.\u201d         \n\n\u00a0         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \nSome artists are very precious about their tools. But I use pencils from Staples, Ticonderoga No. 2, with an eraser on the end. It\u2019s a kind of heaven when the eraser is soft and you can flip the pencil around and use it. The mystery, of course, is miniature golfing. There\u2019s never an eraser on the end of those pencils.         \n\n \nYes, you can\u2019t make a mistake when you\u2019re tallying up the scores at the bowling alley. But of course, people probably use their iPhones to do that anyway. The fact is people don\u2019t really use pencils anymore. They\u2019re going the way of the buggy whip.         \n\n \nI do \u2014 one that was sent to us by the devil himself. There was an electric eraser that you plugged into the wall. It was incredibly hard to hold and top-heavy, because it had such a huge motor, and it would drill a hole through your drawing board. My first job at a design studio, I found this thing in their supply closet, and I thought, I\u2019ve got to try this. Well, it just about took my arm off.         \n\n \nIt\u2019s definitely overkill. And when the rubber gets old, it turns brittle and hard. So you put one of those old erasers on a spinning head, and this thing would grind the rust off your DeSoto.         \n\n \nIt has something to do with the threshold we all crossed in the 1980s, when everything got technical and computerized. We lost our mastery of hand skills. There are some things you can look at and say: \u201cA person made this themselves. It\u2019s not exactly perfect, but it\u2019s perfection at the same time.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/magazine/who-made-that-built-in-eraser.html", "date": "2013-09-13", "description": "And why it didn\u2019t make him rich."}
