{"headline": "Rom\u00e1rio, a World Cup Champion, Is Now a World Cup Dissenter", "body": "\nRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 He has never been like the others. It is not his way. When Rom\u00e1rio de Souza Faria was a boy playing soccer on the streets of Jacarezinho, he dominated the neighborhood pickup game, the pelada, day after day after day. When he became a star for club and country, he sometimes arrived for training in a helicopter. When his career was at its peak and he became an icon throughout the world, he reveled in a social life so rambunctious that he once said, \u201cIf I don\u2019t go out at night, I don\u2019t score.\u201d         \n\nNow, as a politician, Rom\u00e1rio is breaking away again. While other Brazilian legends, including Pel\u00e9, Ronaldo and Bebeto, praise and support Brazil\u2019s plans to host the World Cup next summer, Rom\u00e1rio has cast himself as a dissenter. In his mind, he is the voice of the people, and the people \u2014 as the demonstrations throughout Brazil earlier this year seemed to show \u2014 are loud.         \n\nBut then so is Rom\u00e1rio. That is why he recorded a YouTube message encouraging the protesters who rocked his country during the Confederations Cup earlier this year. That is why he writes on social media about where he sees corruption and who is to blame. That is why he continually criticizes the spending and the planning of the World Cup while also serving as a congressman from Rio de Janeiro.         \n\nSome find it odd. One of Brazil\u2019s biggest soccer stars is now the Brazilian World Cup\u2019s biggest critic? It is strange, to be sure. But for Rom\u00e1rio, it fits.         \n\n\u201cNobody tells me to close my mouth because they know it will never happen,\u201d he said through an interpreter during a recent interview at his apartment in the Barra neighborhood here. \u201cWhen I was a player, I was an idol. People saw me as one of the best ever. I was able to get to the top. I was able to be the best in the world at a certain time.\u201d         \n\nHe shrugged. \u201cIn politics, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be the best politician in the world. But I know I won\u2019t be quiet, either.\u201d         \n\nRom\u00e1rio targets a wide spectrum. He believes the Brazilian soccer federation, known as the C.B.F., is a \u201cdisgrace\u201d and says that its former president, Ricardo Teixeira, who resigned amid allegations of corruption, is \u201cdirectly a part of everything that has been evil in Brazilian football for the last 10 years.\u201d Teixeira\u2019s replacement, Jos\u00e9 Maria Marin, is \u201csomehow even worse.\u201d A spokesman for the C.B.F. declined to comment.         \n\nFIFA is also to blame for \u201crobbing the Brazilian people,\u201d Rom\u00e1rio said, adding that he believed FIFA\u2019s president, Sepp Blatter, had little interest in leaving Brazil in a good state after the World Cup.         \n\n\u201cFIFA got what it came for: money,\u201d he said. \u201cThings like transportation that affect the public after the tournament is over? They don\u2019t care. They don\u2019t care about what is going to be left behind.\u201d         \n\nRom\u00e1rio also has little use for his fellow Brazilians who put a positive spin on what he sees as a missed opportunity to help alleviate his country\u2019s numerous social needs. Ronaldo and Bebeto are ambassadors for the local organizing committee, and Rom\u00e1rio laughed when his former teammates were mentioned. In reference to Ronaldo, who once said that \u201cyou host World Cups with stadiums, not hospitals,\u201d Rom\u00e1rio rolled his eyes. \u201cIgnorant,\u201d he said. \u201cEither Ronaldo and Bebeto aren\u2019t aware of what is going on, or they are pretending they aren\u2019t aware of what is going on. Either way, it is ignorant.\u201d         \n\nInitially, Brazilian officials said no public money would be used on stadium construction. Now, some estimates show as much as 6.4 billion reais of public money ($2.9 billion) will be spent on stadium construction. The total bill to stage the tournament could be 30 billion reais ($13.8 billion), a figure Rom\u00e1rio says leaves him sick.         \n\n\u201cYou see hospitals with no beds,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see hospitals with people on the floor. You see schools that don\u2019t have lunch for the kids. You see schools with no air-conditioning, where kids are going to school in 45 degrees Celsius,\u201d or 113 degrees Fahrenheit. He continued: \u201cYou see buildings and schools with no accessibility for people who are handicapped. If you spend 30 percent less on the stadiums, they\u2019d be able to improve the other things that actually matter.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/16/sports/soccer/romario-a-world-cup-champion-is-now-a-world-cup-dissenter.html", "date": "2013-10-15", "description": "Rom\u00e1rio led Brazil to a World Cup title as a player in 1994, but as a congressman from Rio de Janeiro he says hosting the event next year is a waste of money."}
