{"headline": "Turning Hurricane Sandy\u2019s Scars Into Badges of Survival", "body": "\nIt was a foul, filthy thing that marred the aesthetics, something to scrub off or paint over, something to just get rid of. It stood for what once was: a sour reminder of the thundering water, unimaginable wreckage and exponential wounds.         \n\nNo one would want it anymore, would they?         \n\n \n engagingly pointed out the jagged white line that ran the length of the brick wall inside his wine shop, Pasanella & Son Vintners, in the South Street Seaport. It was about six feet above the floor. It was going to stay right there. The waterline from Hurricane Sandy.         \n\nWhen the East River slammed into the shop, he lost 10,000 bottles of wine. Nasty business for sure, but he prefers that the waterline stay preserved. \u201cI guess I don\u2019t want to erase the past,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel it\u2019s like wrinkles in your face. I don\u2019t like the Botox look.\u201d         \n\nIn fact, he had a plaque made with the inscription, \u201cThe East River Came to Here. 29 October 2012.\u201d He styled it after  \n, that noted the height of the horrid flood of the Arno River in 1966. He was not entirely happy with how it came out, though, and has not mounted it yet.         \n\nCustomers come, marvel, snap pictures of the line; relatives point to it with a grin. Mr. Pasanella said his wife was sometimes irked. She regards it as \u201cdisaster tourism.\u201d         \n\nAs he sees it, Hurricane Sandy, despite its effrontery, had not conquered his wine store; he had conquered it. This was his narrative of the storm.         \n\nFor some people bruised by the hurricane, the waterline has become something of a signature of survival. Most building owners and homeowners have understandably wiped away theirs as they have repaired and rebuilt what the waves gulped up, trying to forget. But quite a few, as part of their formulas to reconcile with the storm, have chosen to live with that waterline, not always knowing why.         \n\nFred and  \n, both 73, thought they had no waterline left. The soggy first floor of their tidy house in Broad Channel, Queens, had to be rebuilt. As Mr. Toborg put it: \u201cOur house looked as if it had been shaken by a giant.\u201d         \n\nYet there was the temperature gauge. It had been clasped to their kitchen window. Water from Jamaica Bay had crested at roughly seven feet, filling three-quarters of the device\u2019s circular innards, terminating its working life. Once their house was repaired \u2014 much of it done free by a local firm, Design Development NYC \u2014 they affixed the largely browned-out temperature gauge back in place, permanently immobile at 82 degrees.         \n\n\u201cIt was amusing,\u201d Mr. Toborg said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a sense of humor, you can\u2019t get through things.\u201d         \n\nMs. Toborg said it reminded her of \u201cthose murder mysteries where a watch stopped and it\u2019s a clue to who did it.\u201d         \n\nIn the backyard, a chunk of wood had lodged in an autumn olive tree. Mr. Toborg could not extract it. He decided to leave that too, another symbol of the terrible day.         \n\nHere, there, everywhere \u2014 waterlines. The Consolidated Edison station on East 14th Street, where flooding caused a transformer to explode, has brass discs about three feet up a wall confirming the waterline. At the Rockaway Beach Surf Club in Rockaway Beach,  \n, a sculptor and one of the owners, swiped protective coating over the actual brown stain, five feet high on the lockers, \u201cbecause I just saw it and said I wanted to keep it.\u201d         \n\nNot far away, the Bungalow Bar & Restaurant had its seven-foot-high line identified on an outside wall; the cable program \u201cBar Rescue,\u201d which helped repair the place, constructed an American flag collage next to the line, made from local debris \u2014 a wooden chicken, a Yoo-hoo bottle, pieces of a fishing rod.         \n\nIn Long Beach, on Long Island,  \n, 52, who has a consulting company, marked the height in his basement \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m 5-5 and it was to my eyeballs\u201d \u2014 and put there a framed collage of rope knots his father had given him. \u201cI grew up by the water,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there is this old adage that if it flooded here once, it will flood here again.\u201d         \n\nMegan Levis, a teacher, and Mark Levis, a marine engineer, had been in their house only six months. They were newly married. They were maybe 100 yards from the Shark River Inlet in Belmar, N.J.         \n\nWhen the water blasted in, they were evacuated by rescuers riding a bulldozer. With a marker, Mr. Levis designated the waterline on the dining room bar. \u201cWhenever we have a fight, we look at the line and we think, well, we\u2019ve been through that,\u201d he said.         \n\nIf it gets necessary approvals, a waterfront advocacy and programming group called  \n is formulating plans to put high-water markers on street signs in stricken Red Hook, Brooklyn \u2014 the entire neighborhood \u2014 to advance understanding of flood threats.         \n\nWhat Jay Hennessey did the morning after the storm was grab a can of yellow spray paint from his home in Bridgewater, N.J., and head to the mill. The mill is the squat Pratt Industries recycling plant on Staten Island, which transforms much of the recyclable paper New Yorkers discard into sheets of usable paper. It sits on the Arthur Kill strait and was flooded. Mr. Hennessey is its general manager.         \n\nAfter reaching the soaked plant, which was freckled with glop, he found marks like a bathtub ring throughout. He spray-painted the height on the machinery and walls. Many pumps and boilers would need inspection. Some 150 motors were shot. He noticed that contractors had left three trucks there. Dumb idea. Ready for the junkyard. The actual papermaking machine, and the boxmaking machine that produces wonders like pizza boxes, stood on the second floor, dry.         \n\nMr. Hennessey could be pardoned if he wanted zero memory of what drenched the plant. Instead, he ordered dozens of yellow signs proclaiming the waterline, and he scattered 30 or 40 of them throughout the property, instilling permanent recollection. \u201cWell, come on, you\u2019ve got to learn from it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing things right now, building walls around our transformers up to 14 feet.\u201d         \n\nHe hoisted himself up from his chair and took a brisk walk around the grounds, a lazy breeze blowing, and pointed out signs, as if presenting bowling trophies. He said, \u201cYou take people on tours, show them where the waterline was and they go, \u2018Oh my God.'\u201d         \n\nOne sign rested in the shrubbery beside the steps to the office entrance, about three feet high. Several were clipped to fences in the parking lot, where dead fish had rotted after the water retreated. In the rear was a small pump house. It bore the highest mark, about 6-foot-6.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something, huh?\u201d he said.         \n\nAt Meade\u2019s restaurant in the South Street Seaport, customers hunched over the busy bar, washing down beers beneath spindly shadows cast through the windows. Easy to spot the waterline here. The rush of water chewed away the paint on the wall up to above five feet, leaving a smudged surface. So it remains, and will remain. Printed on the wall is what it signifies.         \n\n \n, the owner, said: \u201cWhy would I cover it up? It\u2019s history. I also think it gives a nice distressed look, like a New Orleans basement bar.\u201d         \n\nMr. Holin lived nearby in Chinatown and was evacuated from his home. A year later, he still feels the congruent traumas. \u201cI was homeless and in financial ruin in one shot,\u201d he said. \u201cI really thought I was going to move back in with my parents at 37 years old. It has definitely affected my psyche. I\u2019m scared of going out of business for any reason. Things I can\u2019t even think of.\u201d         \n\nOutside Meade\u2019s stands a chalkboard, the kind where you advertise Happy Hour or a meat loaf special. Months ago, a bartender scribbled a defiant message that remains intact: \u201cWhat doesn\u2019t kill us makes our drinks stronger. Nice try, Sandy! Long live the Seaport!\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/29/nyregion/turning-hurricane-sandys-scars-into-badges-of-survival.html", "date": "2013-10-28", "description": "The storm from October 2012 left behind a waterline on many properties delineating the destructive height of the flooding, and some storm victims are resolved to keep it."}
