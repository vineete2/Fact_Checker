{"headline": "Thrown by Life\u2019s Curveballs, a Star Missed the Signals", "body": "\nThe singular event in the life of  \n is not his imminent suspension, or the career home run record that now will never happen.         \n\nThe event that makes him so remote, so rudderless, took place when he was 9, when his father disappeared. This is not pop psychology to explain a man who blundered into the airplane propeller of adult reality. This is his own theory.         \n\nBack when he was a young major leaguer, Rodriguez would occasionally explain himself in terms of his missing father. His mother was strong and smart, and remains so to this day, but he expressed bewilderment that a father could just take off.         \n\nPeople who knew him in Seattle accepted that as the flaw in that apparently perfect equipment \u2014 the willowy shortstop with power, who worked so hard and innately understood the game but not life. He went from earnest to clueless, with no warning light \u2014 \u201calways on the outside of whatever side there was,\u201d as Bob Dylan  \n about the gangster Joey Gallo.         \n\nBarely into his 20s, Rodriguez once told a reporter a poignant tale that in his spare time on the road, he visited college campuses, like Harvard, asking students how they chose the college, and what they studied. He had once feinted toward taking a few courses at the University of Miami, probably as a negotiating tactic with the Seattle Mariners, before taking their huge bonus. Now he claimed he was sampling that alternative life \u2014 but common sense, self-protection, could not be grafted on by visiting a campus or accumulating elegant business suits.         \n\nMany athletes, many people, grow up without a parent or two. Some get through it. But Rodriguez stands on the brink of the suspension that could take him out of baseball, perhaps through the 2014 season, or forever. It is quite safe to say he would not be paying his newest set of lawyers \u2014 he is always changing authority figures \u2014 if baseball did not have a huge case against him. In the  \n of Michael Weiner, the players union needs to protect the bulk of its constituency, the players who stay clean.         \n\nThe labor-management agreement on testing, the bans on certain stimulants and bodybuilding drugs, may seem like the restraint of free will, but the rules keep many athletes and aspiring youngsters from gobbling down unknown pills and potions. Baseball seems to have evidence on Rodriguez, going back to his admission that he used the stuff from 2001 to 2003 \u2014 when he was young and foolish, he later contended.         \n\nNow A-Rod is like the Zelig of baseball, showing up in the spotlight on the busy Canadian doctor, Anthony Galea, who helped bulk up American superstars. And now he is unable to  \n leading to the defunct  \n Biogenesis in South Florida. He was a five-tool player. Now he is a multitool cheat, rejected, like a badly grafted body part, by the main corpus of the  \n.         \n\nOne does not have to be a Yankees fan to understand that there are two kinds of Yankees stars: Rent-a-Yankees Yankees and Real Yankees. Roger Clemens, that swaggering bully, apart from any drug or legal issues, was not a Real Yankee. Wade Boggs was just seeking the brass ring on the merry-go-round. What about Dave Winfield? Ask the Bleacher Bums to take a vote. But Paul O\u2019Neill and Hideki Matsui became Real Yankees, instantly.         \n\nMaybe A-Rod never had a chance to be a Real Yankee, but he ruined his image permanently with his scandals and machinations and posturing. He missed the voice in his childhood saying, \u201cAlex, cut that out.\u201d         \n\n\u201cDad left us when I was 9,\u201d Rodriguez  \n of The Seattle Times in the spring of 1998. \u201cWhat did I know back then? I thought he was coming back. I thought he had gone to the store or something. But he never came back. ... It still hurts.\u201d         \n\nHis father ran a shoe store, but after moving from New York to the Dominican Republic to Miami, he suddenly left.         \n\n\u201cHe had been so good to me, actually spoiled me because I was the baby of the family,\u201d Rodriguez told Finnigan, adding: \u201cI couldn\u2019t understand what he had done. To this day, I still don\u2019t really know how a man could do that to his family: turn his back.\u201d         \n\nHis mother remarried and did well in business, but Rodriguez said the split still upset him.         \n\n\u201cAfter a while, I lied to myself,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cI tried to tell myself that it didn\u2019t matter, that I didn\u2019t care. But times I was alone, I often cried. Where was my father? To this day, I still can\u2019t get close to people.\u201d         \n\nBy contrast, Derek Jeter has a father, Charles, who was a drug counselor, and a mother, Dorothy, who was an accountant, as well as a sister. The family seems to have sent him a message: Derek, whatever you do, don\u2019t be a jerk. Which he never has been.         \n\nRodriguez and Jeter discovered each other when they were teenagers, and in their early years in the majors offered the spare room on trips to Seattle and New York.         \n\nIn 1999, the teams milled around in one of those baseball brawls, and Jeter and Rodriguez paired off away from the scrum, smiling and keeping each other occupied. A transient Yankee, Chad Curtis,  \n, but Jeter and Rodriguez were showing good sense in not risking their expensive talents.         \n\nIn March 2001, A-Rod moved to Texas for that infamous contract of $252 million for 10 years. Just as infamous was  \n in which Rodriguez blabbered that Jeter was \u201cnever your concern\u201d when playing the Yankees, and that Jeter \u201cnever had to lead\u201d his team. They  \n superficially, but they never waltzed after that.         \n\nWhen Rodriguez arrived with the Yankees in 2004, I got a call from my daughter Laura Vecsey, who had been a sports columnist in Seattle and had a kind of big-sister affection for him.         \n\n\u201cDad,\u201d she said, \u201che\u2019s always asking what it was like to have a father in the same business. He doesn\u2019t have a father. You ought to talk to him.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/05/sports/baseball/bedeviled-by-lifes-curveballs-rodriguez-misses-the-guideposts.html", "date": "2013-08-04", "description": "As a young major leaguer, Alex Rodriguez talked about the effect of his missing father on his life."}
