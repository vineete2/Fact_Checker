{"headline": "As Senators Head for Exit, Few Step Up to Run for Seats", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The retirement of  \n, a Democrat who has represented Iowa in the Senate for nearly 30 years, should be the kind of rare opportunity that sends the best and brightest of his state\u2019s political class scrambling to get on the ballot.         \n\nBut so far the only viable candidate to raise his hand is Representative Bruce Braley, also a Democrat. On the Republican side, one potential candidate after the other has taken a pass \u2014 the popular governor, his lieutenant governor, two congressmen and an ambitious state senator who said that he is not willing to have his life turned upside down.         \n\nThe dearth of candidates for an open Senate seat reflects what former and current senators and those who once aspired to the office say is a sad truth: rarely has the thought of serving in the Senate seemed so unappealing.         \n\nOnce considered an apex of national politics second only to the presidency, the \u201cgreatest deliberative body in the world\u201d is so riven by partisanship and gummed up by its own arcane rules that potential candidates from Georgia to Kentucky, Iowa to Montana are loudly saying, \u201cThanks, but no thanks.\u201d         \n\nAdd to that the cost of getting there \u2014 which can include fighting off special interests and \u201c \n\u201d from your own party, exhausting criticism from the increasingly partisan news media, and prohibitive campaign expenses \u2014 and a Senate seat no longer seems so grand.         \n\nSuch weariness is evident not just in the people who are forgoing a Senate bid but also in the exodus of senators not seeking re-election. So far, 8 of the 33 whose terms expire in 2014 have decided not to run again. They include some who probably could have sailed back into office, like Mr. Harkin and his fellow Democrats Carl Levin of Michigan and Max Baucus of Montana, chairman of the powerful Finance Committee.         \n\n\u201cIn the old days, you\u2019d have to carry the Senate Finance chair out on a stretcher,\u201d said Ed Rollins, a veteran political strategist who has advised Republican politicians for four decades, including one in Iowa, State Senator Brad Zaun, who just decided not to run against Mr. Harkin. \u201cThere\u2019s just not quite the enthusiasm I\u2019ve seen in other years.\u201d         \n\nSenate retirements are at the highest levels on record. Since the 2010 elections, a total of 30 senators have bowed out. And more could come yet.         \n\nA similar wave of 29 retirements occurred in the mid-1990s, but there is nothing else on record before that quite as large, according to the  \n\u2019s Vital Statistics on Congress, which has data going back to 1930. Ordinarily, only a handful leave with each election cycle.         \n\nAt this point in 2011, seemingly vulnerable incumbents like Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, and Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, had Republican challengers. In states where seats opened up like Nevada and Virginia, the Democratic and Republican sides of the tickets both quickly filled up.         \n\nThis year there are numerous states with open seats where only one party has a candidate, and many states without a challenger where there is an incumbent the other party would very much like to pick off.         \n\nNo Democrat has emerged in Kentucky to challenge Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, despite repeated avowals from Democrats to defeat him. Democrats also have no strong candidate yet in West Virginia, where John D. Rockefeller IV is retiring.         \n\nThe recruiting troubles for Republicans are worse, in part because gains in the Senate are theirs to lose.         \n\nTwenty Democratic-held seats are up in 2014, compared with 13 held by Republicans. And many of those Democratic seats are in states where President Obama lost in 2012 \u2014 including North Carolina, Montana, Arkansas and Alaska.         \n\nSo far, Republicans have no viable declared candidates in any of those red states yet, though conservatives are urging several strong possible contenders to run, like Representative Tom Cotton in Arkansas. Late Friday, Alaska\u2019s governor, Sean Parnell, said he would not run, as did Representative Steve King of Iowa.         \n\nSenator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, a Republican first elected in 2010 who is helping his party recruit this year, said his first piece of advice to prospective candidates was to spend $50,000 on an exhaustive opposition research paper on themselves so they can get a sense of what mud might be slung their way. \u201cIt can be a pretty miserable process,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve got to try and get people over that hurdle.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/04/us/politics/as-senators-head-for-the-exit-few-step-up-to-run.html", "date": "2013-05-03", "description": "At least eight of the 33 senators whose terms expire in 2014 won\u2019t run again, but potential candidates are passing on a position that once was coveted."}
