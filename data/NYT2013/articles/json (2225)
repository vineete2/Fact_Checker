{"headline": "Routed by Katrina, Stuck in Quagmire of Rules", "body": "\nNEW ORLEANS \u2014 Errol Joseph has the doorknobs. He has the doors, too, as well as a bathtub and a couple of sinks, stacks of drywall, a hot water heater, pipes, an air-conditioner compressor, and big pink rolls of insulation. They are sitting in a shed.         \n\nA few blocks up the street sits the gaunt frame of a house, the skeleton in which all these insides are supposed to fit. They have sat apart for years. The gap between: permits, procedures, policies, rules and the capricious demands of bureaucracy.         \n\nAs people in the Northeast set off on the road back from Hurricane Sandy, there are those here, like Mr. Joseph, who are keen to offer warnings that recovery can be far more difficult than they imagine. Mr. Joseph sees his own story as a cautionary tale, though he admits he is unsure what he would have, or should have, done differently.         \n\n\u201cDo the right thing and fall further behind,\u201d said Mr. Joseph, a big man with a soft voice.         \n\nFour-fifths underwater just seven and a half years ago, New Orleans is, for the most part, in extraordinarily good shape: the airport has gotten a long overdue renovation, restaurants and music clubs are booming, new schools and libraries are opening, and an orchard of cranes marks a rising medical complex. On some measurements, the city is doing far better than it was before Hurricane Katrina.         \n\nBut making it through that recovery was for many a daily trial, grueling, exasperating and slow. Some gave up and never returned. Some, like Mr. Joseph, are still muddling through.         \n\nBegin with the hurricane and the levee failures. The nine-room house that Mr. Joseph\u2019s father had built on Forstall Street, that Mr. Joseph had lived in for most of his 62 years, was flooded.         \n\nIt had taken in water after Hurricane Betsy in 1965, but the family was back at home within three months. Mr. Joseph thought it would be the same in 2005, perhaps quicker because he was insured. He kept up payments on a home-equity loan, he said, while he and his wife and a crowd of relatives squeezed into a daughter\u2019s house in Baton Rouge.         \n\nBut first came urban planning. In those early months, rebuilding commissions considered plans in which certain neighborhoods of New Orleans would revert to green space, including Mr. Joseph\u2019s block in the downriver corner of the city known as the Lower Ninth Ward. His mortgage lender demanded the immediate repayment of his loan plus an early-payoff penalty. His entire flood insurance settlement went to that.         \n\nEventually, residents were allowed to return. Mr. Joseph gutted his house and spent several years trying to prove to the city that it was salvageable. In early 2009, he was granted a reconstruction permit.         \n\nBy that time, Mr. Joseph had received $26,000 from another insurer and a $55,000 rebuilding grant from  \n, the federally financed program to help returning homeowners. He also received a $30,000 grant to begin the work of elevating his home above flood level. All of this was roughly $90,000 short of damage costs. (It would be another year before a federal judge ruled that the Road Home grant calculations most likely discriminated against black residents, prompting the state to adjust its formula.)         \n\nBut Mr. Joseph, who had spent his life repairing houses, figured he could do it himself, and would be back at home by that summer. He spent most of his rebuilding grant buying materials, including windows, shingles and everything else in the shed. In the spring of 2009, he elevated the frame of the house, leaving it propped on wooden cribbing.         \n\nBefore he took any further steps, he contacted the state for an inspection, as he had been instructed.         \n\nThen the inspectors showed up.         \n\n\u201c \u2018Do not do anything to this house until you get a letter of continuance,\u2019 \u201d he recalled one inspector saying. \u201cHe said that three times. He said you would lose your money.\u201d         \n\nSo Mr. Joseph did not do anything to the house. Months went by. No letter arrived. The inspector disappeared. Officials denied that anyone had ever said anything about a letter, said Mr. Joseph, who in his regular visits to state offices would then ask for written permission to move forward anyway.
