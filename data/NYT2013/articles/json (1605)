{"headline": "The Stratospherians", "body": "\nNo sooner do acquisitive urbanites negotiate their peace with the manic pulse of  \n than some escape it without actually leaving. The strategy is an aggressively vertical lifestyle, and prescient developers are enabling it.         \n\nBuyers who can afford the tariff appended to sky-high apartments tend to clamor for space at the very top of the heap. From this heightened perspective, the city is endlessly picturesque. There are views to swoon for, and an amenity that doesn\u2019t exist at street level: silence. Clouds are such quiet neighbors.         \n\nBut penthouse pursuit is a costly contagion. Premiums for height are often paid in floor-to-floor increments of 1 to 2 percent, with prices leapfrogging as much as 10 to 30 percent for views that clear the treetops of Central Park or crest above the brick-and-mortar horizon of neighboring buildings, a price point known as a view-break. According to Michael Vargas, the chief executive of Vanderbilt Appraisal, it is customary to add a premium of 10 percent, \u201cif a special view amenity exists as you rise in the building.\u201d         \n\nWhat do New Yorkers most value in a dream apartment? Height, light and unobstructed views.         \n\n\u201cViews, together with peace and quiet, never go out of style,\u201d said Chandra Tyler, an associate broker at Bellmarc Realty, \u201cand for folks who can afford the better things in life, that\u2019s the sort of apartment on their bucket list.\u201d         \n\nMs. Tyler has a client, Dr. Ezra Sharon, who impulsively listed his two-bedroom penthouse with an intoxicating 1,000-square-foot roof terrace at 200 East 89th Street for $2.25 million.         \n\nBut the minute a reasonable offer came in, he raised the asking price to $2.49 million.         \n\n\u201cI believe he is truly addicted to the height and views,\u201d she said.         \n\nHer intuition seems accurate. The penthouse has been withdrawn from the market.         \n\n\u201cOn a nice day I can see five bridges, Central Park and the East River,\u201d said Dr. Sharon, an arthritis and rheumatism specialist. \u201cAnd on a foggy day it\u2019s all gone and you feel like you\u2019re in a jet in the sky. Living here has been a dream come true. The main thing is it\u2019s very romantic: I\u2019m single and my dates get very excited about sharing with me this fantastic view with Hollywood-style sunrises and sunsets. Of course, it\u2019s expensive, but it\u2019s worth it.\u201d         \n\nAccording to data compiled by Mr. Vargas, of the top 25 sales in 2012 in New York, 7 were classified as penthouses. Of the 107 sales of apartments on the 50th floor or higher, all were condos; the average price per square foot was $2,400, as opposed to the $1,400-per-square-foot overall sales average for condos.         \n\nNaturally the penthouse commands top dollar per square foot. Make that plural: with 21st-century towers, there tend to be multiple penthouse floors toward a building\u2019s apex. (Why offer a single penthouse when, by sleight of design and description, developers can market half a dozen?)         \n\nThough the Woolworth Building\u2019s storybook cupola has yet to be renovated, a fortune is what some billionaire will pay for its five-level penthouse. The reimagined building is to have 40 luxury apartments.         \n\n\u201cAt Woolworth, the first residential floor is above and beyond the height of 90 percent of the penthouses in New York City,\u201d said  \n of Alchemy Properties, the developer of the  \n skyscraper at 233 Broadway and the leader of an investment group that last summer paid $68 million for the top 30 of its 58 floors. \u201cBuyers are seeing light, air and views as more important than outdoor space: the higher you are, the better the perspective.\u201d         \n\nOnly those with vertigo need not apply: \u201cEveryone in the market is a potential buyer where a new skyscraper offering spectacular views is concerned,\u201d said Mr. Vargas, the appraiser, \u201cexcept for people who are afraid of heights.\u201d         \n\nAs the plan for Woolworth attests, skyscrapers aren\u2019t just statement-makers for corporate offices anymore.         \n\n\u201cAirplane views are the wave of the residential future,\u201d said Daria Salusbury, a senior vice president for luxury leasing of Related Companies, whose  \n at 460 West 42nd Street caters to \u201cvertical lifestyle\u201d fans.         \n\nAndrew Vogel, a landscape designer, and Donald Savitz, a dermatologist, own a home in Bedford, N.Y., which they visit on weekends with their twins, now 10. Two years ago they rented a two-bedroom weekend pied-\u00e0-terre at  \n in Midtown because the kids were starting to show an interest in dance classes here.         \n\nThe apartment, on the 47th floor, had startling views that made them hanker for more, and once they decided the twins would attend school full time in  \n, the quest began for a place that felt high but homey. The building that most captivated them was One MiMa Tower.         \n\n\u201cThe higher we got there, the more we liked it,\u201d Mr. Vogel said. When they saw the views from the 54th floor, they decided to buy and combine two units for around $3.2 million.         \n\n\u201cWe walked in,\u201d he said, \u201cand the views to the east, south and west were just literally breathtaking. I think we fell in love with all the blues: the sky and the rivers.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/12/realestate/paying-a-premium-for-sky-high-apartments.html", "date": "2013-05-10", "description": "For the very rich, a sky-high apartment can top the must-have list."}
