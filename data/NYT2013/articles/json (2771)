{"headline": "Out of Network, Not by Choice, and Facing Huge Health Bills", "body": "\nOnce the cardiologist figured out why Raquel and Michael D\u2019Andrea\u2019s 9-week-old daughter was so frail and unable to eat, he immediately sent her to the hospital for heart surgery.         \n\n\u201cHe told us to go home, get packed and get to the hospital, where they will be waiting for us,\u201d Ms. D\u2019Andrea said. \u201cThat was very shocking, but we did it.\u201d         \n\nThere was little time to think about the intricacies of their  \n plan, but Ms. D\u2019Andrea knew she had already selected a comprehensive plan a few years earlier. She gave her  \n card to the hospital staff, but her daughter, Sienna, was ultimately treated by several doctors who were not in their plan\u2019s network.         \n\n\u201cWe assumed that because we showed them our insurance card and nobody had any objections, we were covered,\u201d said Ms. D\u2019Andrea, 35, of Farmingdale, N.Y. \u201cBut I also wasn\u2019t in the mind-set to ask, or to have them stop doing heart surgery on her.\u201d         \n\nSienna left the hospital in early March, two weeks after a successful operation repaired her aorta. But she had a rough road ahead. She went home with a feeding tube in her nose.         \n\nAnd just a few weeks later, after  \n through the night, she spent another 17 days in the hospital. As the family finally arrived back home in mid-April, piles of bills from out-of-network doctors started to roll in.         \n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for patients who visit an in-network hospital to learn later that they\u2019ve been treated by out-of-network providers, resulting in thousands of dollars in charges. And while the Affordable Care Act generally caps what consumers must spend out of pocket when using providers within their plan\u2019s network, it doesn\u2019t protect consumers from large bills from outside providers. Those providers may be free to charge the consumer for the balance of the bill that the insurer did not pay, known as \u201cbalance billing.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWhen the doctors work  \n the hospital, not  \n the hospital, which is often the case, they\u2019re not obliged to join the same networks as the hospital,\u201d said Karen Pollitz, a  \n at the Kaiser Family Foundation. \u201cAnd patients generally have no say in selecting those doctors. Sometimes the patients don\u2019t even see them \u2014 for instance, if their X-rays get sent to a radiologist or their tissue to a pathologist,\u201d patients won\u2019t even know the name of that doctor until the bill comes.\u201d         \n\nThis generally happens because the hospitals don\u2019t always assign doctors to the patient. Individuals may begin treatment with a doctor who accepts their insurance. But if that doctor refers the patient to another specialist, or works with an anesthesiologist who isn\u2019t in the network, the patient is likely to end up with a bill from that provider, said  \n, director of the Center for Hospital Finance and Management at Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health. \u201cAbout the only thing you can do is to go to a hospital where the M.D.\u2019s are all hospital employees,\u201d he added.         \n\nSome states limit the amount that out-of-network hospitals and doctors can charge above what insurance has covered, experts said, but there are no federal curbs on balance billing. The new  \n, does, however, offer some  \n for people who need emergency care: insurers cannot charge more for co-payments and co-insurance for emergency services than they would charge when you use in-network providers. Insurers must also pay out-of-network emergency providers according to a standard schedule, in hopes of lessening the likelihood that patients will be left with enormous bills.         \n\nStill, there\u2019s nothing in the law that stops health care providers from billing consumers for the balance, which is what often happens \u2014 and exactly what the D\u2019Andrea family experienced. \u201cThis is not an issue that the Affordable Care Act fixes,\u201d said  \n, a professor at the Washington and Lee University School of Law and expert on health care laws. \u201cIt is conceivable that the problem gets worse for some people if the Affordable Care Act encourages  \n, which some people think it might do.\u201d         \n\nIf consumers use providers within their network, their annual out-of-pocket costs will vary depending on the type of plan they choose (bronze, silver or gold, for example) and their household income. But the new law states that those expenses cannot exceed $6,350 for individuals and $12,700 for a family of two or more in 2014. (This is true for all plans bought on  \n, and for  \n individual plans.)         \n\nSo what sort of recourse do consumers have when they receive big bills from out-of-network providers? The first step is to make sure your insurance plan paid what it should have, since many plans provide some coverage for out-of-network services. And if you were treated for an  \n (in an emergency room or an extension of it), make sure the insurer paid at least what they would have paid to an in-network provider, said Cheryl Fish-Parcham, deputy director of health policy at Families USA, a Washington consumer advocacy group. Consumers should also check to see if their state has any additional  \n  \ninally, consumers should talk to their providers about reducing any remaining charges.         \n\nConsumers would do well to follow the lead of Ms. D\u2019Andrea\u2019s mother, Livia Cooper. The couple relied on her to deconstruct and analyze the reams of invoices that arrived in their mailbox \u2014 including a collection notice \u2014 since they were busy caring for Sienna.         \n\nMs. Cooper spent countless hours poring over the bills, trying to make sense of it all. \u201cIt was so overwhelming,\u201d said Ms. Cooper, who had to close the women\u2019s boutique she ran with Ms. D\u2019Andrea so they could focus on Sienna, who is now 9 months old. \u201cWe received department bills and there could be 60 invoices on one printout. You would have a bill for $8,100 from one department or $6,500 from another department. It was hard to figure out what was covered, what wasn\u2019t covered and what was balance-billed.\u201d         \n\nThe billing service for the doctors initially wanted the D\u2019Andreas to enroll in its budget plan, which Ms. Cooper refused to do before figuring what the couple actually owed. Her persistence ultimately paid off. She finally reached a supervisor in the billing department and explained that \u201cwe had insurance, were paying the co-insurance, co-payments and deductibles, and could not afford to pay any more than what we were obligated,\u201d she said. She also pointed out that the providers were paid what they would have been paid if they were in the network.         \n\nAs a result, many of their bills were reduced, and some were forgiven. The surgeon who repaired Sienna\u2019s heart was in the plan\u2019s network, for instance, but the assisting surgeon was not. And even though the insurer paid the assisting surgeon the same amount as the main surgeon, Ms. Cooper said that the couple was billed for $4,100, or the balance not covered by insurance. The billing department asked the couple to file an  \n with the insurer, which they did. As a result, the insurance company paid an additional $700 and the surgeon wrote off the balance.         \n\nMs. D\u2019Andrea and her husband, who operates a small entertainment and D.J. business and also refurbishes homes, ultimately paid about $10,000 in out-of-pocket expenses, Ms. Cooper estimates.         \n\nSince the couple\u2019s current health plan will terminate at the end of the year, they are now trying to choose a plan on the New York exchange that includes Sienna\u2019s doctors \u2014 another tedious process. \u201cSienna\u2019s situation is such that it makes us very nervous,\u201d said Ms. Cooper, who is helping the couple research various plans. \u201cYou don\u2019t know who the doctors are on different plans because there are no lists.\u201d         \n\nAs my colleague Abby Goodnough  \nearlier this week, many of the state-run exchanges do not have provider directories or search tools on their Web sites \u2014 at least not yet \u2014 so customers cannot easily check which doctors and hospitals are included in a particular plan\u2019s network.         \n\nAnd even though the D\u2019Andreas could not have known that out-of-network doctors were treating their daughter, it underscores how important it is to ensure all of their providers will be on the plan they ultimately choose. \u201cBasically, if you\u2019re out of network,\u201d Ms. Cooper said, \u201cyou\u2019re out of luck.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/19/your-money/out-of-network-not-by-choice-and-facing-huge-health-bills.html", "date": "2013-10-18", "description": "Consumers may face big payments to doctors who participate in their care, in an emergency or in a hospital, but are not in their insurance network."}
