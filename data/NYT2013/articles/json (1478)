{"headline": "How to Buy a Perfectly Peculiar Tree", "body": "\nOrdinary trees offer shade, privacy, visual interest. Extraordinary trees \u2014 rare, oddly shaped or just plain huge \u2014 provide something else altogether. They can serve as sculptural centerpieces to a yard or perfectly complement architectural details. Most tree nurseries keep some odd ducks in their inventory, but a few, including the three listed below, specialize in unusual specimens they either grow themselves or purchase during regular scouting missions of public and private land. As a general rule, the more unusual the tree, the higher the price. But as Todd Forrest of the New York Botanical Garden says: \u201cPlanting a tree transforms the landscape. And planting a cool tree adds value to your home.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nPrices for rare trees vary widely. Mariani Gardens, a retail nursery, will sell an Ever Red Japanese Maple like the one on the lift for $16,000. A 45-foot-tall copper beech went for $60,000. Installation of a large tree might begin at $20,000.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n If you want a multistemmed tree or one that branches high or low or a root ball with a specific size \u2014 and if you can wait a few years for delivery \u2014 Chet Halka Jr. will custom-grow it. Halka, whose family business was founded in 1954, oversees a 2,600-acre nursery. One of his 35-foot-tall white pines (far left) is on its way to Bedford, N.Y.         \n\n \n Mark Mariani sells large, rare and strikingly pruned trees that he purchases from tree farms, estates and development sites across the country. \u2018\u2018Buying a large tree is like investing in art,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s about falling in love.\u2019\u2019 After planting a big tree, like the Ever Red Japanese Maple (on the fork lift at left), Mariani suggests regular checkups by an expert \u2018\u2018to protect your investment.\u2019\u2019         \n\n \n An oddball-tree legend with a particularly good eye for conifers, Martin Brooks started his business in the 1950s by driving around the country looking for trees. \u2018\u2018The queer ones were always my favorite,\u2019\u2019 he says. Strewn across his 48-acre nursery and arboretum are a giant weeping Norway spruce (above), mature lacebark pines and Parrotia persica.
