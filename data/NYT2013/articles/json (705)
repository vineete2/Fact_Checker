{"headline": "Sleep-Away Camp for Postmodern Cowboys", "body": "\nThe men of Team America were missing an assault rifle. \u201cEverybody pulled a rifle, right, guys?\u201d Eric asked. A 38-year-old ex-Navy lieutenant, he had blond hair to his shoulders and a few days\u2019 worth of deployment stubble.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to have eight,\u201d Brian said. He and Eric worked SWAT together in Virginia and sometimes hunted together, too.         \n\nBrandon, 33, had six 9-millimeter Glock pistols stuffed in his pockets. He surveyed the room: \u201cTwo . . . four . . . six. . . . \u201c         \n\nCarey, a sniper, tried to stifle a laugh. \u201cGood thing they don\u2019t have a counting event.\u201d         \n\nIt was a spring Saturday at the King Abdullah II Special Operations Training Center (Kasotc) in Jordan. The members of Team America were in their barracks after a morning at the range, cleaning their guns so the desert sand wouldn\u2019t jam the actions. Kasotc \u2014 it rhymes with aquatic \u2014 sits in the blasted-out canyon of a rock quarry on Yajouz Road about 15 miles north of Amman. It\u2019s a state-of-the-art counterterrorism-training base, with 6,000 acres ringed by sentry towers and razor wire. The sound of gunfire echoed off the limestone cliffs, spooking the sheep on nearby bluffs.         \n\nTeam America were at Kasotc for the fifth-annual Warrior Competition in which 32 teams from 17 countries and the Palestinian territories would compete against one another on mock missions. Organizers have referred to it as \u201cthe Olympics of counterterrorism\u201d: over the next four days, the teams would raid buildings, storm hijacked jets, rescue hostages and shoot targets with live ammunition, all while being scored for speed and accuracy. It was a stage-managed showcase for the 21st-century soldier \u2014 not the humble G.I., but the post-9/11 warrior, the superman in the shadows, keeping the world safe from murky threats. Bill Patterson, a former U.S. Special Forces soldier who oversees training at the base, said, \u201cWhen you\u2019re on that Black Hawk at 2 in the morning, on your way to target, and the bad guy you\u2019ve been hunting for months is in that building, and there\u2019s 25 guys with machine guns and only 6 of you \u2014 that\u2019s a thrill you\u2019ll never forget.\u201d         \n\nAround 11 a.m., two Boeing Little Bird attack helicopters roared overhead, sending the base\u2019s resident black tabby scurrying for cover. It was time for the opening ceremony. As the teams gathered on the parade ground, they sized one another up. The Swiss team, the Skorpions of the Z\u00fcrich Stadtpolizei, looked like off-duty ski instructors in their matching black jackets and mirrored sunglasses. The Lebanese Black Panthers, the SWAT team for Lebanon\u2019s Internal Security Force, strutted in black hoodies and combat boots. The Jordanian special ops team stood straight-backed in their red berets, quietly confident in their home-field advantage. And the Russians, a bunch of ex-Spetsnaz and K.G.B. members who now worked for a private bodyguard service based in London and owned by an Iranian, showed off Chechen bullet wounds and waved the flag of the Russian Airborne. Its motto: \u201cNobody but Us.\u201d         \n\nEveryone agreed that the Canadians would be tough. They were from Canada\u2019s Special Operations Regiment. Recently back from a tour in Afghanistan, they sported combat beards, intimidating tattoos (Revelation 6:8, \u201cAnd behold, a pale horse: and its rider\u2019s name was Death\u201d) and the kind of burly frames that come from carrying big guns over tall mountains for weeks at a time. \u201cThey look like the dudes from \u2018300,\u2019 \u201d a member of one of four U.S. teams said. Another said, \u201cThey look like werewolf lumberjacks.\u201d         \n\nBut most eyes were on the Chinese. China had two teams, both from the Chinese People\u2019s Armed Police Force. The Snow Leopards were the favorite: formerly the Snow Wolf Commando unit, they were a counterterrorism squad established ahead of the Beijing Olympics. There was a rumor going around that they had been to eight more-specialized competitions and never finished lower than second. (The Chinese maintained this was their first competition.) They marched to the mess hall in formation and did push-ups for fun. By comparison, the American teams \u2014 three Army and one Marine Corps, who were at that moment posing for team pictures and smoking cigars \u2014 looked like high-school kids on a field trip.         \n\nTeam America, with their anonymous uniforms and nonregulation scruff, were the competition\u2019s wild cards. The Dutch marines were pretty sure they were Deltas. The Canadians thought they were SEALs. During the ceremony, a Kasotc representative accidentally introduced them as \u201cAmerican Special Forces,\u201d adding to the intrigue.         \n\nThe truth was, Team America wasn\u2019t actually called Team America. It was a nickname they chose for themselves, after the movie by the \u201cSouth Park\u201d creators \u2014 a sendup of patriotism that they knowingly repurposed as actual patriotism. Their official name was Team I.D.S., for International Defense Systems \u2014 a military supplier that specialized in tactical equipment and ballistics gear. In keeping with the corporate outsourcing of war, I.D.S. was a sponsor of the competition. The team was here not to represent the United States, but to promote the brand.         \n\n\u201cOur guys are SEALs, S.R.T.\u201d \u2014 special-response teams \u2014 \u201cSWAT, ex-Secret Service,\u201d Sebastian Van Duin, a consultant for I.D.S., said. He was a former intelligence specialist from the French Foreign Legion, who knew the team\u2019s leader, Fred, from a job overseas. (What kind of job? They would rather not say.) A former special agent for the Department of Homeland Security, Fred had chased boats in the Caribbean, drug traffickers through Peru, a sniper in post-Katrina New Orleans and gunrunners in Iraq. For the Warrior Competition, he assembled a crew of guys he knew from his time as an S.R.T. commander in Washington, D.C. Most were ex-military: Brian, 35, had served in an elite Coast Guard unit, and Carey, 35, was an antiterrorism sniper in the Marines. Because they still worked in law enforcement, some undercover, they asked to be identified by their first names. One of them, A., did sensitive work for the government and asked to be identified only by a middle initial. Most of the other teams also requested anonymity for their members for security reasons.         \n\nThese were self-proclaimed \u201cregular guys\u201d who chewed tobacco, talked camo patterns and sometimes educated one another in the ways of the world. (\u201cDude,\u201d Brandon said one afternoon, \u201cI just saw two Jordanian guys holding hands! They do that?\u201d \u201cDude!\u201d A. said. \u201cThat\u2019s how you know that\u2019s your bro!\u201d) In idle moments, they would cast themselves in the kind of action movies that celebrate the soldiers they want to be: Brandon was Kevin Bacon. Fred was Bruce Willis. Carey, the \u201cfunny, fat guy,\u201d was Jason Statham, \u201cplus 40 pounds.\u201d And A. was Matt Damon \u2014 the trained killer.         \n\nAfter some speeches by the Jordanian brass, the teams watched a demonstration by Jordan\u2019s renowned counterterrorism unit, the 71st. A dozen commandos in black balaclavas stormed an Airbus A-300, while a dog named Nero apprehended a bad guy in a bite suit. The finale was a big gun battle that lasted five minutes and involved about $10,000 worth of live ammunition; but, for safety reasons, the spectacle unfolded on a shooting range that no one in the stands could see. It sounded very impressive.         \n\nAfterward there was a reception with tea and carrot cake, and the soldiers mingled with diplomats and military attach\u00e9s. Over in a corner, Team America plotted how to smuggle a bottle of whiskey onto the base. \u201cHey, look,\u201d Eric said, \u201cthey\u2019re giving out free Cokes.\u201d He walked over and stuffed a few in his pockets, to use as mixers later.         \n\n \n is shaped like a holstered gun, which isn\u2019t a bad metaphor for the country as a whole. A constitutional monarchy with a well-trained military and a relatively secular population, it is \u2014 for now \u2014 one of the most stable countries in a very volatile neighborhood: Syria to the north, Israel to the west, Saudi Arabia to the south, Iraq to the east. Jordan\u2019s intelligence agency, the G.I.D., is a close partner of the C.I.A. in the Arab world, and over the past five years, the United States has given Jordan more than $3.3 billion in aid and pledged an additional $200 million to help cope with the refugees who have poured over the Syrian border since August.         \n\nKasotc was aid of a kind, too. The base was built by a U.S. construction firm on land donated by the king and paid for by a Defense Department program that provides weapons and infrastructure to friendly foreign governments. In the opening-day speech, Frank Toney, a retired U.S. brigadier general and commander of the Army Special Forces, who now works as Kasotc\u2019s director, said, \u201cWe believe that if your partners are strong, then you will be strong.\u201d         \n\nTraining at the base is handled by the Jordanian armed forces and the ViaGlobal Group, a military contractor based in Annapolis, Md., and the base is staffed by ex-Army Rangers, Deltas and SEALs. (They don\u2019t like to talk about it, but they helped teach the actors playing SEALs in the movie \u201cZero Dark Thirty.\u201d) A week of training at the for-profit Kasotc can cost up to $250,000, including lodging, meals and ammunition; the Warrior Competition, however, was free to any team that could get there. \u201cThis is a marketing tool for Kasotc,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cWe\u2019re advertising our capabilities.\u201d         \n\nMost countries send their elite teams to the Warrior Competition \u2014 the Malaysian special forces, the French Commandos Parachutistes de l\u2019Air \u2014 but the United States often sends infantry regulars. Several Special Ops veterans said they wouldn\u2019t risk tipping their capabilities. \u201cEven when we train guys, you never teach them all the tricks,\u201d one said. \u201cWho knows? We might be back fighting them in a couple of years.\u201d         \n\nThere was another U.S. presence at Kasotc, this one more subdued: a couple hundred Army troops in combat fatigues, who spent their days lifting weights and smoking cigarettes and trying not to be noticed. They had come to Jordan to plan for a possible spillover of the Syrian conflict. The troops did most of their work in an aluminum-sided building with blacked-out windows and satellite dishes on the roof, separated from the rest of the base by concrete barriers and barbed wire. An Army M.P. stood guard nearby, shouting, \u201cDon\u2019t look over the wall!\u201d at anyone who got too close.         \n\nOne afternoon, on the patio outside the base\u2019s store, two of these American soldiers sat at a table, drinking Red Bulls and snacking on Doritos. A Kasotc promotional video was playing on a video screen, and they watched it with interest. In one scene, a group of trainees practiced evasive maneuvers on the driving track. In another, they shot their way down a mock city block while explosions went off around them.         \n\n\u201cDude,\u201d one said, \u201cI want to do that!\u201d         \n\nThe other nodded glumly. \u201cAll this cool stuff, and we can\u2019t do any of it.\u201d         \nMembers of \u201cTeam America,\u201d from left: Matthew, Fred, Sebastian and Brian. \n\n \n the Chinese jumped out to an early lead, winning the first three events. They were well on their way to winning the overall trophy. Watching them conquer an event called Method of Entry \u2014 breaking down three doors, scaling the side of a building, shooting a series of steel targets and sprinting back to the start \u2014 was simultaneously impressive and terrifying. Team America, who spent the previous night in their barracks drinking contraband rum, had trouble getting inside: they wasted five minutes trying to open the door the wrong way and finished near the middle of the pack.         \n\nAt 12:45, the call to prayer sounded over the loudspeaker, and the teams went off to have lunch. A sign on the mess hall read, \u201cReminder: no weapons inside the dining facility.\u201d When the Canadians learned they had placed second in a shooting event, sandwiched between the two Chinese teams, they joked that the third-place team was off somewhere getting 30 lashes. (They were actually doing wind sprints.)         \n\nThat afternoon, during their downtime, the teams checked out the event\u2019s vendors. Part of the draw for sponsors at the Warrior Competition is that they can show off their products to their target audience. The competitors play soldiers while on break from playing soldiers while on leave from being soldiers. If someone wanted to shoot a SIG716 rifle or knock a door off its hinges with a tactical breaching ram, he could do that. If he wanted to fly a small, unarmed drone that fit inside a suitcase and retailed for $200,000, he could do that, too. And if he wanted to try his hand at the AA-12 \u2014 a fully automatic 12-gauge shotgun (tag line: \u201cDon\u2019t Fight Fair\u201d) capable of firing 300 rounds a minute \u2014 he could do that, too. Unless he was a member of the one of the Chinese teams, in which case it would be a violation of the U.S. State Department\u2019s International Traffic in Arms Regulations.         \n\nBrian wanted to try the shotgun. \u201cLet\u2019s go shoot that shotty!\u201d he said. He squeezed off five rounds and grinned. \u201cThat\u2019d be hell on a whitetail.\u201d         \n\nThat night, everyone loaded onto buses for a team mixer at the Intercontinental Hotel. \u201cI hope they have karaoke,\u201d Carey said. He turned to A. in the seat behind him. \u201cHow do you say \u2018Call Me Maybe\u2019 in Arabic?\u201d         \n\n\u201c \n\u201d A. said. It meant, literally, \u201cMy name is Maybe.\u201d         \n\nWhen they arrived, the reception was in full swing. The Malaysians were on the patio, drinking juice. The Russians were at the bar, definitely not drinking juice. There was tuna carpaccio and crudit\u00e9s and little ceramic bowls of gourmet potato chips. Outside, Sgt. Shkendije Demiri and Capt. Brittney Ray stood chatting in their uniforms. Demiri and Ray, both in the U.S. Army, are the first two women in the history of the competition. The Arab teams, in particular, seemed to love them. \u201cThey all want to take photos with us,\u201d Ray said. \u201cIt\u2019s like seeing a unicorn.\u201d         \n\nRay was an M.P. and platoon leader who graduated from the Virginia Military Institute and qualified for one of the Army teams by being a top pistol shot. She had also trained as a sniper and spent the previous afternoon teaching several Jordanians how to shoot. Demiri was a reservist who worked as a firefighter in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. She had been in the country a few months, doing joint training with the Jordanians, and said she had an enjoyable conversation with the Palestinians. \u201cI\u2019m trying to get them to bring a woman next year,\u201d she said.         \n\nBack inside, Team America was talking hockey with the Russian Spetsnaz members. A. finished his second glass of red wine and looked across the room. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go talk some Arabic with my Iraqi brothers.\u201d         \n\n \n his unit by name. They were \u201cthe program\u201d or \u201cthe community.\u201d You would not have picked him out of a lineup. About 5-foot-10 and a little thick in the middle, he had a permanent look of pensive amusement. If you didn\u2019t know better, you would think he was just Fred\u2019s buddy who tagged along \u2014 which, in a way, he was.         \n\nA. grew up on the East Coast \u2014 \u201cupper-middle-class, white, Mayberry.\u201d He went to college and got a white-collar job, but after Sept. 11 he was compelled to enlist. \u201cI didn\u2019t want my grandkids to learn about 9/11 in history class and come home and say, \u2018Hey, Granddad, what did you do when those savages flew planes into our buildings?\u2019 and be like, \u2018Nothing,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to get my jihad on.\u201d         \n\nA. served two tours in Iraq. The first was at the time of the surge, and there was a lot to do. He would go on two or three raids a night, targeting bomb makers, I.E.D. experts and money men. A. was an assaulter: he and his teammates would blow open a door with a strip of C4 then cover one another while they cleared the room. The missions were always capture or kill, he said. It was a tossup which way it would go. A. enjoyed his first tour in Iraq. He learned Arabic, fell in love with the people and the food. But by the second, he grew frustrated. \u201cWe used to hit a house like, boom,\u201d he said. \u201cGet the dude, grab anything that looks important and we\u2019re out.\u201d But now, he said, there were so many regulations that they couldn\u2019t do their jobs. Sometimes he couldn\u2019t even use his sledgehammer. \u201cWe actually had to do a soft knock on the door, instead of assaulting it,\u201d he said incredulously.         \n\nA. left his unit when his commitment was up the following year, then spent some time in Afghanistan as an unarmed contractor before coming home. He said he didn\u2019t miss it much. Granted, the nighttime raids were \u201cpretty awesome.\u201d \u201cBut you gotta remember,\u201d he said, \u201cyour opportunity to do that is really small. Everyone got spoiled, because we had an unprecedented decade of two wars.\u201d A. said he had a hard time relating to the average American, especially armchair patriots who didn\u2019t join the fight when they had the chance. He said he felt more kinship with the Iraqis. He also drew a distinction between Special Ops guys who joined up when he did and those who enlisted during peacetime. \u201cPre-9/11, there were probably guys who didn\u2019t even want to go to war \u2014 they just wanted to go on cool trips,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a different mind-set when you join up knowing you\u2019re gonna get it on.\u201d         \n\nA. was the kind of soldier even soldiers looked up to. Fred called him \u201cthe ghost\u201d and \u201cthe invisible man\u201d and their \u201cspecial friend.\u201d Sometimes A. played along, telling tales about blood-splattered Iraqi swimming pools and war-zone pranks that inevitably began, \u201cSo there I was. . . .\u201d But more often than not, he seemed uncomfortable with the attention. \u201cThese are just competition teams,\u201d Brian sniffed one afternoon. \u201cA.'s not a competitor \u2014 he\u2019s a killer.\u201d A. gave a halfhearted smile and looked away.         \n\n \n the Warrior Competition staged a pair of night events. A full moon hung low over the mountains, and the parade ground was illuminated by spotlights. Team America waited its turn at an event called Hostage Rescue, outside a big, Abbottabad-like compound in the center of the base. The objective was to blow a door with an explosive charge, rush inside, shoot some targets and escape with the hostage; basically what A. had done in Iraq.         \n\nA. was lying in the dirt with his eyes closed, using his helmet as a pillow. I asked if being here felt surreal \u2014 the desert compound, the moonlight, all the shooting. \u201cNah,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is theater. It\u2019s totally contrived.\u201d Then he told a story from his time in Iraq. Members of his unit were hunting one of Saddam\u2019s executioners, and an Iraqi civilian they were working with offered to help. A. said the Iraqi told him: \u201cI know this guy. Give me a gun and a car, and I will kill him!\u201d A. said he responded: \u201cDude, I hear you. And it sounds like a good idea to me on so many levels. But my government will put me in jail.\u201d         \n\nAs the men checked their helmets and body armor and loaded magazines into their M4s, Fred called them together to outline a battle plan. Moments later, Eric shouted, \u201cFire in the hole!\u201d and blew the door. They moved through the building, clearing each room by firing two rounds into 3-inch-by-5-inch paper targets. From outside, you could track their progress up to the second floor by the steady pop of rifle fire.         \n\nA. grabbed the hostage \u2014 a 180-pound dummy \u2014 and the team raced back downstairs. Outside, in the glow of the spotlights, they whooped and high-fived over their score: zero misses in just over three minutes, the fastest time so far. Someone joked that they should change their name to the International Death Squad. Their daring night raid had been a success; all that was missing was the film crew.         \n\nIn the van on the way back to the armory, A. struck up a conversation with the Jordanian driver. It turned out that he had worked with the Americans in Iraq. A. asked where.         \n\n\u201cRamadi,\u201d he said. \u201c2003 to 2006.\u201d         \n\n\u201cOh, man,\u201d A. said. \u201cYou were getting it on! Did you go out with them?\u201d         \n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d the driver said. He didn\u2019t elaborate, and A. didn\u2019t ask.         \nThe \u2018\u2018urban area\u2019\u2019 at the King Abdullah II Special Operations Training Center in Jordan. \n\n \n few days of the competition, friendships formed along geopolitical lines. The Americans hung out with the Canadians. The Russians hung out with the Kazakhs. The French kept to themselves, and the Chinese really kept to themselves. But as the days went on, people started to loosen up. The Greeks and the Palestinians played soccer together. The Americans and the Iraqis talked about Tupac. The Arab teams started rooting for each other, cheering, \u201c \n\u201d \u2014 Let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go! The Canadians, inspired, added their own twist: \u201cYolo! Yolo!\u201d (which is slang for \u201cyou only live once\u201d).         \n\nOne afternoon, the Swiss Skorpions were basking in the sun, sipping hot chocolate from a paper cup. \u201cNot bad,\u201d one said. He checked the back of the packet and smiled. \u201cNestl\u00e9. It\u2019s Swiss.\u201d         \n\nA few tables over, Brian swapped his American flag patch for a Canadian one. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna need \u2018em when the North Koreans come,\u201d he said. Next to him, Carey was showing off pictures on his iPad: there he was with his Marine unit in Nairobi after the 1998 embassy bombing (\u201cWe were hunting Bin Laden before he was Bin Laden\u201d), and there were his three kids dressed up for Halloween (one as a soldier). \u201cHey, want to see a picture of me and the president?\u201d he asked. He swiped to a photo of President Obama and the first lady at an event in Virginia. \u201cSo there\u2019s the president,\u201d he said, then zoomed in on a tiny black dot standing on a rooftop, \u201cand there\u2019s me!\u201d         \n\nSitting nearby was an officer named Mohammed, who described himself as a commander in the Iraqi Counter Terrorism Force. He was bald underneath his black beret, and his eyes were hidden behind mirrored sunglasses. On his arm was a patch bearing the unit\u2019s symbol: an eagle perched on a skull. He joined Saddam\u2019s army as an M.P. when he was 17 and stayed until the second Iraq war. He enlisted again in 2004, after the regime\u2019s collapse and now was fighting groups hostile to the Americans and to the new Iraqi government.         \n\nThe I.C.T.F. is based in Baghdad, where there were more than a dozen bombings in the previous month alone. A wave of attacks on the 10th anniversary of the American invasion had left 60 people dead in the week before the I.C.T.F. team came to Kasotc. \u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous job,\u201d Mohammed said. \u201cBut the pay is very good. And what we have faced before is much more difficult.\u201d He said they wanted to win the competition like everyone else. But mostly they were here to learn new tactics. \u201cThis is not a vacation for us, like it is for some of the other teams,\u201d he said, gesturing vaguely toward the Swiss.         \n\nMohammed said he had seen friends die, but he stayed in the army to provide his wife and children with a good life. He had four children; the oldest, a boy, was 15. I asked if he hoped his son would join the army someday. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI lived the life of a soldier. I know how hard it is.\u201d Instead he hoped his son would grow up to be a pharmacist or an engineer.         \n\nThe last morning of the competition dawned cloudy and cool. As a few teams were finishing up the final event, word began to circulate that King Abdullah was on his way. Abdullah commanded the Royal Jordanian Special Forces before he was king, and the military is still close to his heart. A certified pilot, diver and parachutist, he frequently travels the country in a helicopter he pilots himself. He often visits his namesake base. \u201cThis is his baby,\u201d Patterson said of Kasotc. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna say he\u2019s just like George Bush, because some people would be offended \u2014 but he\u2019s very proud of his country, and he loves his men.\u201d         \n\nTwo camouflaged Black Hawk helicopters circled overhead, followed by the arrival of the royal motorcade, six black Lexus S.U.V.'s with identical license plates. The king popped out and shook hands for a few minutes, a Jordanian TV crew trailing him. He tried his hand at the pistol range and hit every target.         \n\nThat afternoon, A. went to say goodbye to the Iraqis. They were staying in a dorm at the end of a dusty gravel road. Issa, the sniper, greeted him at the door with a big hug: \u201cWelcome, welcome.\u201d The Iraqis had just finished showering, and they were in various states of undress: briefs and towels and shower shoes. The room smelled of sweat and cologne.         \n\nIssa sat down on a bunk next to A. and gave him some gifts: an Iraqi Army watch and a small I.C.T.F. flag. \u201cThank you,\u201d A. said, bowing. \u201c \n.\u201d Then he opened his backpack and passed out his gifts: a combat knife for everyone, along with his extra shirts, pants and other gear.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too much!\u201d Issa told him. \u201cIt\u2019s too much, man.\u201d         \n\nA. shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t need it anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d rather see you have it.\u201d         \n\nA. and the Iraqis traded Facebook info and promised to keep in touch. Back at Team America\u2019s barracks, the guys were playing spades and drinking screwdrivers. \u201cWhere you been?\u201d Carey asked. A. told them, and they said they wanted to donate their gear, too. Only Brandon seemed unsure: \u201cThey\u2019re not going to use it on Americans, are they?\u201d         \n\nA. said these were the good guys. Brandon nodded. \u201cIf you\u2019re good with it, then so am I.\u201d         \n\nAt 6 p.m. sharp, the teams boarded buses to go to the Four Seasons for the awards banquet. While they waited, some of the U.S. Army personnel were pushing tires around the soccer field. \u201cLook at these ding-dongs,\u201d Brian said. \u201cWhat are they doing, Jazzercise?\u201d         \n\n\u201cArmy guys are so weird,\u201d Eric said.         \n\nOn the way into the city was a slaughterhouse, which was reputed to have some of the freshest shawarma in town. Just as the bus drove by, one of the slaughterhouse employees walked over and shot a sheep in the head. \u201cDid you see that?\u201d Carey asked, his eyes wide.         \n\nA. smiled. \u201cThat was awesome.\u201d         \n\nOn stage at the hotel\u2019s grand ballroom, two dozen trophies were laid out: 500 pounds of custom bronze, cast in the shape of Spartan helmets, crests and all. \u201cPretty pimp, huh?\u201d Bill Patterson said to Fred.         \n\n\u201cReally pimp,\u201d Fred said. First there was an all-you-could-eat buffet, and then a slide show with a soundtrack by Linkin Park. When the awards started, the Snow Leopards were the big winners: they had taken first in 5 of the 12 events. They spent almost as much time on the stage as the master of ceremonies. When Team America finally broke the Chinese winning streak and collected a trophy for Hostage Rescue, the other teams let out a relieved cheer: \u201cU-S-A! U-S-A!\u201d         \n\nWhen the Snow Leopards got back up to accept their award as the overall winners, the room went quiet. Gracious in victory, the Chinese team handed out gifts: T-shirts and gym shorts stamped with the logo of the People\u2019s Armed Police Force. In the lobby, Brian checked the tags. \u201cHa,\u201d he said. \" \u2018Made in China.\"\u2019         \nThe Snow Leopard unit of the Chinese People\u2019s Armed Police Force celebrates its win at the awards ceremony. \n\nAfter the banquet, the Canadians, an Army team and Team America headed across town for a nightcap. In the taxi, A. tipped $5 on a $5 fare. (\u201cThat\u2019s why they love us,\u201d he said.) There was a bar in the basement of the Grand Hyatt, called JJs, that was supposedly pretty nice. Inside, everyone had to pass through a metal detector \u2014 the legacy of a 2005 suicide bombing in which a terrorist under the direction of Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi blew himself up in the Hyatt\u2019s lobby, part of a synchronized assault on three Amman hotels that killed 57 people.         \n\nRounds were bought, stories were swapped. As the party wound down, one of the Army men came up to A. He was 38, a major; he had never seen combat. The front of his blue shirt was dark and wet where someone had spilled a whiskey and Coke. The major asked A. which branch he was in, and A. said had been in the Navy. They chatted for a few minutes about the week, about the competition. The major said he had the time of his life. \u201cI gotta tell you,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been in the Army for 14 years, and I think this may be the highlight of my career.\u201d         \n\nIf A. had any thoughts about armchair warriors or guys who just wanted to go to cool places, he kept them to himself. Instead, he raised his glass of Amstel and smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s awesome, man.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/magazine/sleep-away-camp-for-postmodern-cowboys.html", "date": "2013-07-19", "description": "The world\u2019s counterterrorism forces meet for a friendly shoot\u2019em-up in the desert."}
