{"headline": "Ring Around the Collar at 535 Park Avenue", "body": "\nThe trim elegance of 535 Park Avenue, unusual because it was built by its future owners instead of a developer, has long been marred by the fractured and soiled glazed terra cotta on two lower floors. Now the refined building, completed in 1910, is taking a radical approach to a longtime problem.         \n\nThe co-op began life in 1909, when a group including bankers, lawyers and a painter decided to erect an apartment house at Park Avenue and 61st Street.         \n\nAt that time, after a false start in the 1880s, the co-op model was beginning to come into its own, although with a distinctive difference from the current version. The early co-ops were owned by half the residents, who then rented out the remaining apartments to defray their costs. This is uncommon now \u2014 perhaps even nonexistent.         \n\nThe consortium hired the architect Herbert Lucas, and The New York Times reported that the structure would be built \u201cas closely resembling a large private house as possible under the circumstances.\u201d         \n\nLucas had made his name with 24 Gramercy Park South, described by The Real Estate Record and Guide as \u201calong high class Colonial lines.\u201d He used the same splayed lintels, simple brick and half-oval balconies for 535 Park Avenue.         \n\nThe building had many duplexes, presumably taken by the original co-op owners, as well as half-floor simplexes for rental. Co-op prices are hard to pin down, but it appears that the rents were about $200 per month for a half floor with three bedrooms.         \n\nThe original shareholders were people like Howard Mansfield, a member of the white-shoe law firm Lord Day & Lord, established in 1845 and closed in 1994. Another was Charles Loring Brace, a minister who was the treasurer of the Children\u2019s Aid Society. Brace fought the exploitation of children, and was key to the organization of the  \n, which took neglected and abandoned children out of the slums to new homes in the West. The 1915 census records 79 residents at 535 Park, including 28 servants.         \n\nAbove it all was the painter Lydia Field Emmet, who had the top floor, divided between a two-bedroom apartment and her studio, 22 by 37 feet, with a large triple window facing north.         \n\nEmmet was perhaps the most successful member of a family of painters that included her sister Rosina Emmet Sherwood and her cousin Ellen Emmet Rand. She studied in Paris and never married. In the catalog for a 1982 exhibition of her work at the  \n in Pittsfield, Mass., her great-niece Lydia Sherwood McClean described her as a yoga enthusiast who, at the beginning of the summer season, would ride horseback to her house in Stockbridge, Mass., from New York. According to the exhibition\u2019s curator, Martha Hoppin, Emmet ultimately charged $20,000 for her paintings, typically portraits of the gentry class.         \n\nAlthough to contemporary eyes 535 Park Avenue seems fairly tame, The Architectural Record in 1911 saw it differently. \u201cIt aims at the palatial and attains the sham-palatial,\u201d the anonymous reviewer wrote, describing the projecting cornice as \u201chuge, umbrageous, unmeaning, irrelevant\u201d and characteristic \u201cof the cheapest and vulgarest kind of tenement houses.\u201d         \n\nThe writer also was offended at the combination of red brick and white terra cotta, denouncing it as \u201ccheap finery\u201d and pronouncing the building \u201cPalazzo Spotti.\u201d Whew.         \n\nSomehow the \u201csham-palace\u201d has come to fit right in on Park Avenue; horses do not bolt and women do not shrink affrighted. Lydia Emmet\u2019s studio has been split in two; Mrs. McClean, who lived there with her great-aunt, gave my wife, Erin, and me a triple-panel leaded-glass window from the apartment, perhaps the north-facing window. The window, with the Emmet crest at the center, was designed by  \n, the husband of the artist Jane de Glehn, another sister.         \n\nFor at least a decade, No. 535\u2019s two-story-high band of glazed terra cotta has been stained and crazed, or marred by a network of spidery cracks. It is not as bad as the worst parts of the  \n Building, but quite visible, because the terra cotta is hard by the sidewalk.         \n\nLimestone is the near-universal choice for ground-floor material, and it is unclear why Lucas did not use it for 535 Park. The critic of 1911 called the contrast between the medium-toned brick and the cream-colored terra cotta \u201cglaring,\u201d but would not likely be impressed by the dirty gray shade it has acquired.         \n\nPeople who have those magnificent one-piece solid fireclay bathtubs from this period are in the same fix. Some consider the crazing and other marks of age a patina; others are unhappy that so intimate an appliance does not look squeaky clean.         \n\nAs it happens, the shareholders at Lydia Emmet\u2019s unusual co-op have opted for squeaky clean. The managing agent declined to return telephone calls, and the ground floor is almost entirely covered with boards. But a small section on the building\u2019s north face has escaped the co-op\u2019s attention, and there one can see that the old terra cotta has been roughed up to receive a new coating, a bright white stucco with a surface coarser than sandpaper.         \n\nAlthough the building may have another trick up its cooperative sleeve, at the moment it is hard to believe that the stucco will not pick up atmospheric dirt quickly, and re-earn No. 535 Park its title of Palazzo Spotti.
