{"headline": "Post-Fukushima, Arguments for Nuclear Safety Bog Down", "body": "\nAlarms sounded and lights flashed as control panel dials at a nuclear power plant in upstate New York warned that the power for safety equipment was failing. The room went dark until the emergency lights kicked in. But there was no reason to worry on this frozen winter morning.         \n\nThis was a simulation by Constellation Energy, the owner of the  \n plant on Lake Ontario, for the benefit of two of the five members of the  \n. It was part of an intense lobbying campaign against a proposed rule that would require utilities to spend millions of dollars on safety equipment that could reduce the effects of an accident like the Fukushima Daiichi meltdown in Japan two years ago.         \n\nIn this drill, the company tried to show it could handle emergencies without new devices and, of course, everything went according to plan.         \n\nEver since the nuclear accident in Japan released radiation into the atmosphere, regulators in the United States have been studying whether to require filters, costing as much as $45 million, on the vents of each of the country\u2019s 31  \n.         \n\nThe filters, which have been  \n of the regulatory commission, are supposed to prevent radioactive particles from escaping into the atmosphere. They are  \n and much of Europe, but the American utilities say they are unnecessary and expensive.         \n\nThe industry has held private meetings with commissioners and their staffs, organized a drill like the one this month at Nine Mile Point, and helped line up letters of support from dozens of members of Congress, many of whom received industry campaign contributions.         \n\n\u201cWe all desire an ideal solution, but it needs to be an integrated one,\u201d said  \n, Constellation\u2019s chief nuclear officer. She said that a filter was not as helpful as water in the reactor building that would both cool the fuel and absorb radioactive contaminants.         \n\nAlready, at least two commissioners have questioned the proposal, and industry officials predict that when the vote is taken in the coming weeks, the industry will prevail. But critics are hardly convinced that the industry\u2019s alternative is the safer.         \n\nComputer models, they said, may suggest that plant operators can prevent large radioactive releases without the filters, but real-life accidents come with unpredictable complications.         \n\n\u201cYou never know if it is going to run according to the script,\u201d said Edwin Lyman, a nuclear power expert at the  \n.         \n\nThe debate over the filters reflects a simmering tension that has been building inside the regulatory agency since the Fukushima accident in Japan. A tug of war among commissioners and between some commissioners and staff members has produced repeated votes that reject staff safety recommendations.         \n\nAnimosities have welled up to the point that four of the five members complained to the White House in late 2011 about the \u201cserious damage to the institution\u201d caused by Gregory B. Jaczko, then the chairman of the commission. The members complained that Mr. Jaczko was cutting them out of the loop as he prepared plans for how the industry should respond to the disaster in Japan.         \n\nMr. Jaczko, who  \n, fired back, telling the White House that, \u201cunfortunately, all too often, when faced with tough policy calls, a majority of this current commission has taken an approach that is not as protective of public health and safety as I believe is necessary.\u201d         \n\nThe White House shied away from the dispute, but accepted Mr. Jaczko\u2019s resignation.         \n\nCongress has since gotten involved. Over the last month, 55 lawmakers have signed letters, some pushed by industry lobbyists, that urge commissioners to reject the filters.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the time to be rash with hasty new rules,\u201d  \n, the ranking Republican on the Senate committee that oversees the industry, in a letter signed by six other senators. (Twelve senators \u2014 11 Democrats and an independent \u2014  \n supporting filtered vents.)         \n\nRepresentative John Barrow, Democrat of Georgia, in a letter signed by 25 other House Democrats, argued that the filtered vent \u201cis not justified on a cost-benefit basis,\u201d a fact the commission staff acknowledges. The commission must \u201cachieve the regulatory goal in the safest, most effective, and least costly manner,\u201d the letter said.         \n\nMany of these lawmakers, both  \n, have received significant campaign contributions from the industry. For instance, Mr. Barrow\u2019s  \n election was the Southern Company, a Georgia-based utility that is a major player in nuclear power. Some of the lawmakers also have nuclear reactors in their districts, a major source of tax revenue and jobs.         \n\nThe appointment books for certain commission members, reviewed by The New York Times, show frequent meetings with the industry, including private sessions at the commission\u2019s headquarters. Nuclear industry opponents occasionally have had their own private meetings, but not nearly as often, the records show.         \n\nE-mails obtained by The Times also demonstrate the teamlike approach taken by the industry and the regulators in dealing with safety questions, as they have worked behind the scenes with the Nuclear Energy Institute, the leading trade association, to try to prevent a reaction against nuclear power in the aftermath of the Fukushima accident.
