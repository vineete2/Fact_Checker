{"headline": "Who Made That Water Bed?", "body": "\nIn the late 1960s, a design student named Charlie Hall embarked on an independent project to explore the idea of comfort. He poured a cornstarch-based gel into an enormous vinyl bag, sealed it and climbed on top. He felt as if he were levitating, his body cradled in the gel that molded around him. But there were drawbacks: the chair began to stink after a few days, and it weighed 300 pounds. \u201cUnless you had a forklift in your living room, it was an impossible piece of furniture,\u201d he says. Hall switched to water as his filler. And he decided to build a mattress instead of a chair; since people rarely move their beds, the weight wouldn\u2019t matter so much. Plus, he says,\u201cIt\u2019s the piece of furniture you spend the most amount of time in.\u201d         \n\nHall built the demo model in his house in Haight-Ashbury and invited his design class from San Francisco State University to stop by and critique his project. \u201cSomebody got a bottle of wine,\u201d Hall says. \u201cThe party didn\u2019t stop until everybody got too tired and went home.\u201d It was 1968, just after the Summer of Love, and he had created a heated bed that undulated, seeming to hold you in its embrace.         \n\nSoon Hall set up a studio where he handcrafted his water beds; he sold them by word of mouth. \u201cOne went to a Smothers Brother, another to a Jefferson Airplane member,\u201d Hall says. \u201cWe would deliver these things all over Marin County and San Francisco on top of a Rambler station wagon. I did make one for Hugh Hefner, upholstered in green velvet.\u201d         \n\nWithin a few years, competitors offered knockoff water beds for less than $100 \u2014 and the mattress became notorious for leaks and deflations. But Hall says that what really sank the water bed was the installation: \u201cGenerally, a professional would come in and fill it up, then set up the frame, the heater, this and that. It was a lot of work to put in. So when people made a move, often the water bed got left behind and they opted for a simpler solution.\u201d         \n\nStill, even if we rarely sleep on them today, the water bed may have transformed our ideas about comfort. \u201cIt used to be \u2018firmer is better,\u2019 \u201d Hall says, until \u201cwater beds changed what people look for in a mattress. The Tempur-Pedic and the memory-foam things and pillow tops are all about making a bed conform to you.\u201d         \n\n\u00a0         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \nThe bed has sensors in it that measure your body. It takes into account your height, your weight, the distribution of your weight, the width of your shoulders, the width of your waist, the width of your hips, the amount of lumbar curve you have and the flexibility of that lumbar curve. After you\u2019ve been on the bed for about two weeks, the system has learned your sleeping behavior. So the bed decides: \u201cYou\u2019re 86 percent sleep-efficient. I want to do better than that.\u201d And the bed makes adjustments.         \n\n \n Yes. I could see my sleep patterns change by watching what happens inside my mattress. So if I chose to go out and have two cocktails for dinner, I could see that impacted my sleep.         \n\n \n Yes, I get onto my phone and pull up my sleep stats. There\u2019s an app that comes with the bed, and the consumer can answer questions in a sleep diary. So the consumer could send this data to the\u00a0Sleep to Live Institute. We would then help them solve their problems with their environment, their behavior and sleep equipment \u2014 like a pillow or a comforter.
