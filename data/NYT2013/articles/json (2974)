{"headline": "A Success in HD, but at What Cost?", "body": "\nPeter Gelb, the general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, now says that it was not the most fortunate choice of words when he  \n a decline in attendance at the house to the \u201ccannibalization\u201d of the audience by the company\u2019s high-definition broadcasts.         \n\nYet that comment gained attention because it taps into some reservations that many opera buffs and critics have had since Mr. Gelb began the Met\u2019s pioneering venture of bringing live performances to movie theaters with HD screening capacity.         \n\nIn many ways the project, which started in 2006, has been an indisputable success. The Feb. 16 broadcast of the Met\u2019s wildly colorful  \n updated to Las Vegas in the early 1960s, grossed $2.6 million in North American movie theaters alone, with an estimated audience of 113,000 in more than 800 outlets, according to the Met. An additional 125,000 saw the broadcast on 900 screens in 30 countries throughout Europe, the Middle East, Russia and Latin America.         \n\nThe recent broadcast of  \n grossed $1.6 million in North America. It is hard to imagine the broadcast of a 1914 Italian rarity,  \n on Saturday, doing that well. But you never know.         \n\nStill, if opera fans in the greater New York area get used to the convenience and affordability of seeing performances in their local movie houses, will they eventually stop coming to the Met? And will live video performances, with close-up camerawork, vivid sound systems and intermission interviews, become more appealing to some than seeing an opera from a top balcony seat in a big house?         \n\nMr. Gelb made his \u201ccannibalization\u201d comment late last month when the Met announced a slight reduction in ticket prices for the 2013-14 season as an inducement to operagoers. In a recent phone interview Mr. Gelb said that in describing the impact of the HD broadcasts on attendance at the house he had meant to emphasize the positive.         \n\nLooked at in context, he said, \u201cwe have quadrupled our paying audience.\u201d The decline of ticket-buyers at the house is just a couple of percentage points, he explained. The total \u201cpaying audience\u201d is slightly over three million, which includes up to 800,000 attendees at the Met each season.         \n\nWho is going to the HD broadcasts, especially in the New York area? The Met has done some surveying, Mr. Gelb said. The results suggest that most attendees are already interested in opera. Whether the HD venture will convert new audiences into operagoers is another question.         \n\nFor decades the Met\u2019s live Saturday matinee radio broadcasts were incalculably beneficial to the growth of opera. Countless famous singers and conductors grew up listening to those broadcasts. Especially in the days before opera on television or on video became more common, there was something magical about those broadcasts. It was almost like being there, even though you had to envision the sets, the costumes, the action. You imagined what  \n as Turandot or  \n as Lucia looked like as you listened enthralled to their vocal artistry.         \n\nThat was certainly my experience. Living in the New York area, I was able to attend quite a few operas at the Met through my high school years. But on Saturday afternoons, when I did not have a track meet at school or was practicing the piano, I was tuned in to the Met. And it was not just hearing the legends like  \n and Jon Vickers that excited me. There were many surprises, singers of less renown who proved unexpectedly amazing. Like the day in 1982 (by then I was teaching in Boston) when the soprano Ruth Welting in Offenbach\u2019s \u201cTales of Hoffmann\u201d  \n: here was a tour de force of brilliant, effortless coloratura singing and comic delivery. The audience went crazy.         \n\nMy point is that the live radio broadcasts were (and for many people remain) the next best thing to being at the Met.         \n\nBut the HD broadcasts are like an alternative opera experience, with sophisticated camerawork, high-quality sound systems and the ambience that comes from being part of an audience in a movie theater. The broadcasts are invaluable, of course, and the sophistication of the directing is beyond what would seem possible to accomplish live.         \n\nSomehow, though, the HD broadcasts do not stoke your desire to see the production in person, as the radio broadcasts did in the old days. Many critics and fans have felt, and I often agree, that some of the Met\u2019s recent productions come across better on HD than in the house \u2014  \n of Wagner\u2019s \u201cRing,\u201d for one.         \n\nThose young people who see their first operas in HD broadcasts might easily conclude that they get what opera is all about. It might be a hard sell to convince these newcomers that no matter what they thought about seeing \u201cParsifal\u201d in a movie theater, opera is not opera unless you hear those amazing voices live in a house with splendid natural acoustics, like the Met.         \n\nI remember as an adolescent sitting in the stratosphere of the Met where the beautiful sound of Leontyne Price\u2019s pianissimo high notes as Aida would float up and surround me. You cannot have such an experience in a cinema.         \n\nIt makes sense that a majority of those attending HD broadcasts are already hooked on opera. They know how to enjoy the special qualities of the video broadcasts because they know what the real thing is. And, as Mr. Gelb said in the phone interview, the Met can rightly take pride that broadcasts have \u201cextended the operagoing life of older customers,\u201d those people who have become too frail to make as many trips to Lincoln Center as they used to.         \n\nSurveys have shown that the decline in the Met\u2019s audience has come from \u201coutlying areas of New York,\u201d Mr. Gelb said, with people who used to visit the Met now simply finding it easier to stop by the local movie house on Saturday.         \n\nThe Met\u2019s statistics on the project are impressive. Consider this: In Austria and Germany alone, some 39,000 people went to movie theaters to attend the HD broadcast of \u201cRigoletto.\u201d But the questions linger over the long-term effects of this success.
