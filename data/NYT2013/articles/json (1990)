{"headline": "On Holding Hands and Fake Marriage: Stories of Being Gay in Russia", "body": "\nMOSCOW \u2014 Yegor grew up in a Siberian town called Lyubov, which means \u201clove\u201d in Russian, but he has never told his parents that when he falls in love, it is with other men.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want them to feel ashamed,\u201d Yegor, 34, wrote in response to  \n to readers of The New York Times to share their experiences of what it is like to be gay in Russia. \u201cThis has nothing to do with legislation,\u201d he said.         \n\nHe was referring to a federal law signed by President Vladimir V. Putin in June banning \u201cpropaganda on nontraditional sexual relationships.\u201d Officials say the law will protect children, but it is widely recognized as an effort to suppress homosexuality.         \n\nIn the West, the law provoked a loud outcry, including some calls for a boycott of the Olympic Games in February in Sochi. Within Russia, the law has drawn unprecedented attention to the issue of gay rights. It has also apparently contributed to a rise in anti-gay violence, including an attack on Sunday at the office of a charitable group in St. Petersburg that works to prevent the spread of AIDS. One victim lost an eye when two masked men stormed the office and began firing guns that shoot high-velocity rubber bullets.         \n\nTo better understand what it is like to identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender in a country that officially discourages openness, The Times  \n. More than 400 responded, in Russian and English, from across this vast land, from the cosmopolitan metropolises of St. Petersburg and Moscow, to Vladivostok on the Pacific, from the predominantly Muslim Caucasus in the south, to sparsely populated towns in Siberia.         \n\nThere have been few prosecutions under the new law, and none of the readers said they knew of anyone arrested. Still, nearly all the readers who wrote in said they had felt the psychological sting of the law, and many said they were afraid. Many asked to be identified only by their first names.         \n\n\u201cThough my hair is short and I don\u2019t look gay, I am always scared,\u201d wrote Mikhail, 30, from Novosibirsk.         \n\nSome expressed self-loathing; others a fierce desire to leave the country.         \n\nVisiting Sochi on Oct. 28 with the new president of the International Olympic Committee, Thomas Bach, Mr. Putin insisted that there would be no discrimination during the Winter Games.         \n\n\u201cWe will do everything, and our athletes and fans will do everything, to ensure that participants and guests feel comfortable at the Olympics in Sochi, irrespective of nationality, race or sexual orientation,\u201d Mr. Putin said. Russian rights groups complained that Mr. Bach did not respond to a request for a meeting.         \n\nThe disquiet among Russian gays and lesbians is pervasive.         \n\n\u201cOur country is afraid of those who are different,\u201d wrote Anastasia Nikolaeva, 18, a lesbian who lives in St. Petersburg.         \n\nA number of teenagers in smaller cities said that they had never met anyone who is openly gay, at least not in person. Readers of all ages cited the Internet as the best way to meet others who identify as L.G.B.T., meaning lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, though some said they were now nervous to go online because of reports of the Web\u2019s being used by \u201chunters\u201d to find targets for violence.         \n\n\u201cI pretty much always knew I\u2019d die alone unless I got out of the country somehow,\u201d wrote Eugene, 28, of Orenburg, near the border of Kazakhstan. \u201cThere are about 100-150 people from my town registered at one of the few dating sites for abominations like myself and I\u2019m pretty sure at least a tenth of those are hunters.\u201d         \n\nFollowing are a selection of fuller reader responses, lightly edited and translated if necessary.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nI grew up in Siberia, in a tiny gold-mining town called Lyubov, meaning love in Russian. The complications for me started in high school, especially in terms of becoming aware of my sexuality. The topic simply wasn\u2019t discussed, except in rude anecdotes and jokes. So the only way to live as a gay teenager in such a place out was to be completely closeted. I just waited to get out of there.         \nYegor, 34, was not open with friends about his sexuality until his twenties. \n\nAlthough it was easier for me when I went off to the university \u2014 I was in a city and the culture was more accepting \u2014 that topic was still never discussed. From 1996-2001, there were no open gays in our university. Not a single teacher or a student.         \n\nMy professor was one of the first people I felt I simply must tell. I would meet with her and she would give me advice. But when a person can\u2019t be himself, it\u2019s such a huge psychological burden. Eventually I mustered the bravery and I decided to make a confession.         \n\nI went to her house, prepared to tell her everything, but she wasn\u2019t home. At first I just went away. But then I reminded myself that I had to do this so I returned and left a note: \u201cI must tell you something. I am gay. Take it as you want. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d It was the most emotional moment in my life. On the one hand it was a huge relief, but on the other hand I didn\u2019t know what would come of it. I was in shock.         \n\nThe next day my knees were shaking as I walked to the university. After class when almost everyone had left, she said, \u201cYegorchik, come over here for a second.\u201d         \nTwelve kilometers to the village of Lyubov, meaning \"love\" in Russian. \n\n\u201cI got your note,\u201d she said. \u201cI need to talk to you seriously later of course, but this is what I want to tell you now. I want you to know that no matter what happens, you will always remain a closest and dearest person to me.\u201d This was a great comfort to me, but I couldn\u2019t say anything. I ran away.         \n\nAs time went on, I was waiting for that next conversation, because I wanted to talk about it more. But she didn\u2019t bring it up. And then one day, some time later, when we were driving in the car and she was talking about my future family, I said, \u201cWell you know, I\u2019m not planning to get married.\u201d And she said, \u201cYou just don\u2019t know yourself.\u201d That was incredibly sad for me.         \n\nMy parents in Siberia are still unaware of my preferences and I don\u2019t feel like telling them. This has nothing to do with legislation, but simply because I don\u2019t want them to feel ashamed. \u2014 \n         \n\n \n         \n\nMy boyfriend and I are Muslims from the Caucasus. It\u2019s impossible to live there peacefully as a gay person, and the more people found out about our relationship, the more worried we became. Finally we decided that I\u2019d enter into a fake marriage with a lesbian girl, and that would be an excuse to move to St. Petersburg (my fake wife was originally from there). We thought life would be more relaxed once we were in St. Petersburg, but then Vitaly Milonov announced his initiative to pass an anti-gay law. It was as if society had lit a fuse; everywhere we went people were talking about gays, about how they should be burned and killed. My boyfriend and I have been together for more than two years. We live together, as a stable family unit. It would be nice to make friends in our new city, but we generally avoid getting to know other people, especially since it\u2019s often a trap. It\u2019s safer to live secretly. And if being gay wasn\u2019t enough, they have a thing against Muslims and people from the Caucasus in this city. \u2014  \n         \n\n \n         \n\nThe whole thing started when I fell in love with my Russian teacher. I was 12 and she was a kind of goddess for me. When all the girls started being interested in boys, I started writing poems about my teacher. I never thought that something was wrong with my feelings. I was just a kid who fell in love for the first time, and it felt like a kind of magic.         \n\nI thought that she was the only one I could love, but later in a new class I fell for another girl. I never said anything, but maybe there was         \nAnastasia\u00a0Nikolaeva, who has been riding horses for almost ten years, came out to her family and friends through social media. \n\nsomething in the way I looked at her that made the whole thing clear. She told everyone in our class that I was different. Kids started calling me \u201cShrek\u201d and wrote \u201cYou\u2019re not welcome here\u201d on my desk. They even chased me out a window. (I landed, unhurt.) I felt like an animal being hunted, but no teacher paid attention. What hurt most was that the girl I fell in love with was the first one to bully me.         \n\nAll through this, I started to wonder, what will happen if I tell my old friends, the ones that have always loved me, that I am gay. When I did, they were kind of shocked, but nobody turned away from me. Later on I had my first girlfriend, then second, then third. Girls were joking with me, \u201cIt seems that it\u2019s easier for you to find a girlfriend, than for any of us to find a boyfriend.\u201d         \n\nThings were going much better until I got involved with this girl whose mother was a judge at an arbitration court. The Federal Security Service did a check on the phone records and social network profiles of everyone in her family. They showed her all our messages and told her to \u201csolve this problem\u201d if she wanted to keep on climbing the ladder.         \n\nSuddenly, I had an adult woman calling me from different phone numbers, telling me to never even say a word to her daughter again. She called me \u201cdirty dyke\u201d and threatened to tell everything my parents if I didn\u2019t stay away. The only thing I could think the whole time was \u2014 how is this woman a judge, making official decisions about who is guilty and who is not? She even sent her daughter to private school in Switzerland to separate us.         \n\nStill my parents did not know. One day my mother told me her brother was going to have dinner with us and that he was bringing his special \u201cfriend.\u201d That\u2019s how I found out that my uncle has a boyfriend. He was the first person in my family I truly opened up to, but even he told me to be cautious about telling my parents, so I waited.         \n\nTwo years later \u2014 just a few months ago now \u2014 I took part in a project, \u201cKids/Teens-404,\u201d focused on getting Russian L.G.B.T. teens to share their stories. In essence, I came out on my social network profile page for everyone to see \u2014 my mother\u2019s friends, acquaintances I\u2019ve overheard making homophobic remarks. But all the feedback that started streaming in was positive: People told me they were proud of me; that I was doing the right thing telling the truth about myself. Not one person said anything negative. And in that moment I understood: People in Russia are more tolerant than I had thought.         \n\nMy uncle told me that my parents also saw my story on [the social media site] VKontakte. \"Be good. They will always love you, no matter who you are,\u201d he told me. Maybe they couldn\u2019t tell me themselves, but still these were the best words in the world for me.         \n\nWhat people have to understand is that our country is afraid of those who are different, because for years if you were friends with somebody in the forbidden categories in the U.S.S.R., you would be automatically considered an enemy of the state. Most parents don\u2019t hate their gay children, they are just afraid of what other people will think and say. It\u2019s not only hate that speaks out loud in our people, but also the fear of being misunderstood. \u2014 \n         \n\n \n         \n\nRussia is an easy place to be gay insofar as the lack of exposure to openly gay people makes the Russian public almost comically unaware of the (stereo)typical behavior that homosexuals actually exhibit. Unless your public statements and actions explicitly reveal your homosexuality to someone on the street here, then no one will ever assume you are gay. Remember: this is a country where the straight men sport their thong underwear loud and proud. As an expatriate in Russia, I face relatively few restrictions when compared to the locals. Western gays are allowed to be fairly open because Russians tend to view all Westerners with the same degree of bemused curiosity. Our behavior (just as that of heterosexual Westerners) is often seen by the locals as neither gay nor straight, but merely Martian.         \n\nGay men almost exclusively meet on sites like GayRomeo or the ubiquitous hookup apps Grindr and Scruff. [There were more than 50,000 Russia-based Grindr accounts in June, at the time the federal gay propaganda ban was signed, according to Grindr.] In a society that is not, on the whole, \u201caffluent,\u201d almost every person of every social standing has an iPhone. There are actually lots of people here whom we would describe in the West as \u201cgay.\u201d Willing sex partners are never in short supply, but the challenge lies in finding the rare gay Russian who doesn\u2019t live with his wife or parents. In terms of relationships, it\u2019s extremely difficult to find a gay Russian who will openly acknowledge his homosexuality. Beyond this, the chief challenge for me in Moscow lies in maintaining interest in a gay scene that remains, for a city of 12 million people, completely hidden, spectacularly one-dimensional and mind-numbingly provincial \n         \n\n \n         \n\nIf it wasn\u2019t for this vile, nasty law, I think I\u2019d already be a mother. My partner and I have lived together for many years, and the idea to have kids first came up probably about four years ago. Eventually we decided that we wanted to have kids by artificial insemination. I believe in being openly L.G.B.T. When the doctor at the clinic asked why I haven\u2019t had kids yet, I didn\u2019t try to make something up, I simply said that I\u2019m part of a homosexual family. And it didn\u2019t cause any sort of problems. The clinic is private and expensive, so I think they just didn\u2019t care.         \nNatalia Kruglova and her partner have put off having a baby indefinitely. \n\nAll of this was about a year and a half ago, right when this law was starting to be discussed. There were also some political events that weren\u2019t comforting. How will our child grow up, I wondered. I was still fairly optimistic though. I have gay friends who are raising an adopted child. And it seemed to me that all problems can basically be resolved on a personal level.         \n\nBut when the time came to go through with it all, we started hearing all of this stuff about how the law would affect children. If there\u2019s a ban on gay people\u2019s being portrayed positively in the media, then the child might get a poor image of his own family.There were frightened conversations happening in the L.G.B.T. community. We decided to delay the decision for two or three months.         \n\nI thought about the alternatives. I realized that if we did have a child, I\u2019d have to give up being open and live quietly with the baby. If I continued on as an activist, it would be a huge risk for the child. It was a difficult decision but I realized I couldn\u2019t silently live a lie, so we decided not to have the baby. \n         \n\n \n         \n\nI work as a lawyer in an L.G.B.T. organization. Since the law passed, it\u2019s become more difficult to simply walk into court because nationalists come and harass us. There\u2019s a trial going on now, a man is accused of attacking L.G.B.T. activists after a rally. His friends keep showing up at court to support him. At first it was just a couple standing outside and yelling insults at us when we arrived. Then on July 4, a group of 10 or so showed up, holding flags, blocking the door and shouting, \u201cThe court is for people, not for fags.\u201d They threw eggs at us. The police didn\u2019t come when they were called.         \nMaria Kozlovskaya, left, with her partner. \n\nAt the most recent session in October, they attacked us again. We came out of the court and there were reporters there, asking for commentary. I started to answer their questions and a guy appeared and started throwing eggs at me, at my back, my head. Then he crossed the street and ran away. I tried to report it to the police, but they didn\u2019t listen. The guy\u2019s friend recorded the whole thing and posted it to social networks, calling me a \u201cfaggot\u201d and joking that they should have thrown stones and not eggs.         \n\nAll over St. Petersburg, people have become less tolerant. After the passage of the law, people began to insult us outside grocery stores and next to our homes. A man followed me and my partner into a store once and yelled, \u201cThey\u2019re perverts, they must be thrown out of this store where normal people buy things.\u201d He tried to call the director of the store over. He was sober, young \u2013 probably around 30 years old. He yelled that he had a pregnant wife at home and didn\u2019t want his kids to grow up around people like us. No one answered him, so after some time he left.         \n\nAfter that incident, I try to keep track of my behavior in public, to check if there are potentially dangerous people nearby. If there\u2019s ever a suspicious person around, we don\u2019t hold hands or show our feelings, even in the most minimal ways. \n         \n\n \n         \n\nI teach history at a university. Right now I\u2019m teaching a master\u2019s course called Gender History.         \n\nI try to explain the concepts of non-normative sexuality very clearly, to show what we get from studying the gay subculture in St. Petersburg at the turn of the 20th century. Because I teach master\u2019s students, I haven\u2019t encountered any problems with the law (they are not considered \u201cunder age\u201d like undergrads), but I notice that the students react as if what I\u2019m teaching them is very strange.         \nIra Roldugina wears skirts when she is teaching. \n\nI always show up to teach in a skirt. I feel more confident that way. If I came in my normal outfits, I feel I might seem less legitimate in their eyes. It\u2019s already clear that my behavior and mannerisms don\u2019t fit within the traditional woman-in-academia box. Even in my skirt, my students tease me about my hair sometimes.         \n\nI\u2019m planning to continue my research into the gay subculture in Russia. I found some incredibly rich materials in the archives on sexuality and subcultures in the early Soviet Union and Stalinist periods, but I can\u2019t discuss it with my colleagues, even other professors the history department. I want to go to Canada to finish my Ph.D. I understand that here, my work won\u2019t be interesting to anyone. And there\u2019s hardly a chance I\u2019d ever get a grant for that kind of research. \u2014  \n         \n\n \n         \n\nI grew up in Vladivostok, a port city in Russia\u2019s Far East that most Americans have never heard of. As a teen I did not stop to consider my sexuality, but I did dream of travel. My first trip to America was in 2007, when I was 19. I was accepted to a student exchange program and assigned to spend the summer serving popcorn in a movie theater in San Francisco. There was this guy at work and someone told me he was gay, and it was like I had been told, \u201cHe just got out of prison.\u201d I remember my first feeling was that I had to avoid him because I\u2019d been warned about these sorts of people when I was young. He was about 30 years old, this Mexican guy, and one day he offered me something to drink. And I thought, \u201cI am not going to take anything from him!\u201d         \nSasha Korbut in New York City, where he now lives. \n\nThat same trip in San Francisco, I stopped a lady to ask for directions and then when I heard a male voice I realized it was a guy. Oh my God! I didn\u2019t show it in my face, but I was in shock. Back in Vladivostok, a transsexual person was something that existed only in the movies. I remember my first thought was, \u201cWell, he\u2019s walking around the city and he\u2019s not afraid. And it\u2019s O.K. Really? Is it possible?\u201d         \n\nAs I became a dancer and took jobs and studied in other countries, I did not grasp what I was escaping. But little by little I began to understand. I was walking along the street in Barcelona with my first real boyfriend. Suddenly he took my hand. Oh my God. I freaked out so strongly. I was looking around to see if someone was watching us or judging us. I thought someone would punch us in the face or spit at us. I still had that old Russian mentality. But nothing happened.         \n\nNow I\u2019m studying and working in New York. Just 35 minutes ago I kissed my boyfriend in a coffee shop. I would still never do that in Vladivostok. I talk to my gay friends back home and many of them don\u2019t see it as bad because they have gotten used to living under certain kinds of rules. But under these rules, nothing ever changes. In small cities and rural villages, gay people just go on, seeming like something from a fairy tale.  \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/07/world/europe/stories-of-being-gay-in-russia.html", "date": "2013-11-06", "description": "To better understand what it is like to identify as L.G.B.T. in a country that officially discourages openness, The Times asked readers to share their stories."}
