{"headline": "Women Were Secretly Filmed at West Point, the Army Says", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A sergeant first class on the staff of the United States Military Academy at West Point has been accused of videotaping female cadets without their consent, sometimes when they were undressed in the bathroom or the shower, according to Army officials.         \n\nThe Army is contacting about a dozen women to alert them that their privacy may have been violated by the suspect, identified as Sgt. First Class Michael McClendon, and to offer support or counseling, officials said.         \n\nThe allegations at West Point, the nation\u2019s oldest and most prestigious military academy, come in the midst of growing outrage in Congress, at the Pentagon and from President Obama over reports of sexual harassment and assault in the armed services. They also come as the Army has begun integrating women into combat positions, bringing added demands for fair and equal treatment of those in uniform.         \n\nThe revelations are especially startling at West Point, which has had problems with sexual assault but also has many progressive faculty members and prides itself on having an environment of discipline and respect. Women have been enrolled at the two-century-old institution, on a commanding bank of the Hudson River in upstate New York, for nearly 40 years.         \n\nDefense Secretary Chuck Hagel, who is to deliver the commencement address at West Point on Saturday, was briefed on the case Wednesday morning. Pentagon officials described him as \u201cconcerned and disturbed\u201d by the allegations.         \n\nSergeant McClendon, of Blakely, Ga., faces charges under four articles of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, for indecent acts, dereliction in the performance of duty, cruelty and maltreatment, and actions prejudicial to good order and discipline. Sergeant McClendon, who had been assigned to the academy since 2009, was transferred to Fort Drum, N.Y., before charges were filed on May 14, Army officials said.         \n\nDuring his tenure at West Point, Sergeant McClendon served as a tactical noncommissioned officer, a position described in academy personnel documents as a staff adviser \u201cresponsible for the health, welfare and discipline\u201d of a company of 125 cadets. The person in the position is expected to \u201cassist each cadet in balancing and integrating the requirements of physical, military, academic and moral-ethical programs.\u201d         \n\nThe student body at West Point numbers about 4,500 cadets. Slightly more than 15 percent are female, and senior Army officials pledged immediate action to try to regain their trust.         \n\n\u201cThe Army is committed to ensuring the safety and welfare of our cadets at the Military Academy at West Point \u2014 as well as all soldiers throughout our Army,\u201d Gen. John F. Campbell, the Army vice chief of staff, said on Wednesday. \u201cOnce notified of the violation, a full investigation was launched, followed by swift action to correct the problem. Our cadets must be confident that issues such as these are handled quickly and decisively, and that our system will hold those responsible accountable.\u201d         \n\nOfficials said some of the videos were taken in the showers or the bathrooms, and some elsewhere on campus. Documents in the case indicate that in some instances Sergeant McClendon entered women\u2019s bathroom and shower areas without knocking.         \n\nThe number of sexual assaults reported at the military\u2019s service academies has been steadily rising in recent years. In the 2011-12 academic year, there were 80 reports of sexual assault, compared with 65 in 2010-11 and 25 in 2008-9. The Defense Department is required by Congress to track sexual assault reports at the military academies.         \n\nThe Army made no announcement of the charges against Sergeant McClendon, but it provided details after The New York Times learned of the inquiry from people with ties to West Point who said they were alarmed by the allegations and wanted to learn of the academy\u2019s plans to investigate and prevent future violations.         \n\nGeorge Wright, an Army spokesman, said the service and West Point would \u201crebuild trust\u201d through their response. He said the Army was committed to \u201cproviding the full range of support to those whose privacy was violated,\u201d as well as \u201ckeeping them updated on the case.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThe Army will ensure the military justice system works through to its proper conclusion,\u201d Mr. Wright said.         \n\nAccording to military service records, Sergeant McClendon joined the Army in 1990 and trained as a combat engineer. He deployed to Iraq from 2004 to 2005 and from 2007 to 2009 and was awarded a Bronze Star.         \n\nIn recent weeks, allegations of sexual harassment and assault against women in the military have prompted vows from the Pentagon\u2019s highest officials that they will confront the problem.         \n\n\u201cIt is time we take on the fight against sexual assault and sexual harassment as our primary mission,\u201d Gen. Ray Odierno, the Army chief of staff, wrote in a message to all of his service personnel last week. \u201cIt is up to every one of us, civilian and soldier, general officer to private, to solve this problem within our ranks.\u201d         \n\nThese acts, General Odierno wrote, \u201cviolate everything our Army stands for.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThey are contrary to our Army values,\u201d he added, \u201cand they must not be tolerated.\u201d         \n\nMr. Obama last week summoned the Pentagon\u2019s senior leaders to the White House, telling them that the levels of sexual assault across the armed services were a disgrace that undermined the trust essential for the military to carry out its mission.         \n\nAt the White House on Wednesday, Jay Carney, Mr. Obama\u2019s press secretary, said the president had \u201czero tolerance for sexual assault in the military.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThose who participate in it dishonor the uniform they wear,\u201d Mr. Carney said, and \u201cthose who are victims of it and who wear the uniform should know that the commander in chief has their backs.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/23/us/sergeant-accused-of-secretly-filming-female-cadets.html", "date": "2013-05-22", "description": "The suspect, Sgt.
