{"headline": "Imagining LeBron James as a Net, a Bobcat, a Cavalier (Again) ...", "body": "\nA new N.B.A. season is upon us, and competition for the league\u2019s most coveted prize figures to be fierce. We refer here not to the Larry O\u2019Brien Championship Trophy, but to the king of potential free agents.         \n\nWith  \n having an out in his  \n contract next summer, has your favorite franchise devised a nontampering romancing plan should James decide to take his talents from South Beach?         \n\nYou may have noticed that N.B.A. free agency receives more attention than actual N.B.A. games. That\u2019s because the league and its partner sponsors are so heavily invested in creating celebrities and half the country is asleep or just plain tired of indoor sports when championships are won in mid-to-late June.         \n\nNobody ever gets bored with watching grown men grovel, however. When James last peddled himself to the most persuasive bidder \u2014 Pat Riley, who emptied a cloth bag of championship rings on the bargaining table \u2014 his decision rated a capital D and was watched breathlessly in prime time. Mass hysteria followed. James\u2019s jerseys were burned on the streets of Cleveland. Nationwide, he was called a traitor, a fraud and even a whore (on the cover of a book whose author happened to also quit Cleveland to go work someplace else).         \n\nBut who could now blame James for wondering about growing old in Miami, especially after already winning two championships for the city and after Rolling Stone predicted it might soon be underwater because of rising seas? That would surely put a crimp in the city\u2019s night life and, worse, limit the Heat\u2019s ability to attract good role players.         \n\nWhile promising not to talk about free agency during the pursuit of a third straight title, a quest that begins Tuesday night at home against Chicago, James recently told ESPN: \u201cI would love to spend the rest of my career in Miami with this great team and great organization as we continue to compete for championships. That\u2019s ideal. But we don\u2019t know what may happen from now to the end of the season. That\u2019s the nature of the business.\u201d         \n\nIn other words, the King must be wary of Dwyane Wade\u2019s projected health and Miami\u2019s ability to stay on top. His mind and eyes are open. So here is an imagined sampling of what he might see and hear as he makes his itinerant rounds. Or perhaps not that imaginary.         \n\n \n For cap reasons, the Nets probably cannot contend for James unless he remains with Miami without extending his contract and opts out in 2015.         \n\nBut all they need to do to establish their viability is flash their combined 2013-14 payroll and luxury tax bill \u2014 an estimated $183 million \u2014 on the Barclays Center big screen when James and Miami drop by for Brooklyn\u2019s home opener. And have Mikhail D. Prokhorov hammer the message home by grabbing the mic to announce that, \u201cI spend more to win championship than my good friend Mr. Putin wastes on silly Olympic figure skating and bobsled.\u201d         \n\n \n The owner Michael Jordan tells The Charlotte Observer that James is a better player than he ever was and that he certainly could never beat James one on one. Jordan then gets sick to his stomach, but only when no one is watching.         \n\n \n An arena full of  \n fans takes in the overdue spectacle of the owner Dan Gilbert presenting James with a framed No. 23 jersey he wore in Cleveland \u2014 in Miami, No. 23 is retired in honor of Jordan \u2014 while raising a replica to the rafters of Quicken Loans Arena. \u201cTraitor?\u201d Gilbert says. \u201cReally? Who ever said that?\u201d         \n\n \n With Kobe Bryant making his season debut, the Buss family calls a news conference to announce that it will team with Harvey Weinstein and that it has signed James to star in a remake of \u201cThe King and I.\u201d Jack Nicholson will co-star along with Carmelo Anthony. Bryant will direct.         \n\n \n The minority Kings owner Shaquille O\u2019Neal picks up James at the airport in a Buick LaCrosse and tells him, \u201cI may have retired from the game, but not from being big.\u201d         \n\n\u201cHow can you be big in a cow town like Sacramento?\u201d James says.         \n\n\u201cSon,\u201d Shaq says, \u201cwherever I go is Gotham City. And you, too.\u201d         \n\n \n The Nike strongman, Phil Knight, offers James a stake in his company if he joins the Blazers. He also promises to build a new manufacturing plant in James\u2019s native Akron, Ohio. \u201cWe\u2019ll call it Jamestown,\u201d Knight says.         \n\n \n At Walt Frazier\u2019s Wine and Dine on 10th Avenue, Frazier greets James and entourage at the door. Earl Monroe and Bill Bradley show James to a table. The lights dim. Willis Reed limps over to James and says, \u201cI\u2019ll be your waiter, King James. May I suggest one of our finest Champagnes, a 1970 vintage. ...\u201d         \n\n \n The Cowboys owner Jerry Jones welcomes James to Dallas by offering him the starting tight end position for one game every season \u2014 if he\u2019ll become a Maverick.         \n\n \n In a pregame ceremony, the Celtics reretire No. 23, adding James\u2019s name to Frank Ramsey\u2019s jersey in the rafters. Bill Russell quietly offers James his sainted No. 6 \u2014 James\u2019s Miami number \u2014 should he join the most successful professional basketball team in history.         \n\n\u201cYoung man, you have no idea what it\u2019s like to win until you\u2019ve won as a Celtic,\u201d Russell says while pulling back his sports jacket to reveal his .38-caliber Smith & Wesson. \u201cNo pressure, though.\u201d He slaps James\u2019s back and unleashes his world-famous cackle.         \n\n \n Before the Heat\u2019s last regular-season home game, a copy of the \u201cThe Winner Within\u201d appears in James\u2019s locker, with original Riley inscriptions: \u201cDon\u2019t let other people tell you what you want\u201d and \u201cFrom contender to winner. From winner to champion. From champion to Dynasty.\u201d         \n\nBut not before another Decision.
