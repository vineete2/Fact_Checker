{"headline": "Summers Pulls Name From Consideration for Fed Chief", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 For Lawrence H. Summers, President Obama\u2019s preferred candidate to lead the Federal Reserve, the messy debate over a military attack in Syria was the final sign.         \n\nAfter weeks of opposition to his candidacy from an array of progressives, the president\u2019s inability to rally Congressional Democrats on Syria persuaded Mr. Summers that his most important audience \u2014 the Senate, which must confirm a Fed chairman \u2014 probably could not be won over.         \n\nHe concluded that the White House was also unlikely to overcome opposition to his candidacy from many of the same Democrats, who view him as an opponent of stronger financial regulation, according to supporters who insisted on anonymity to describe confidential conversations with him.         \n\n\u201cClearly Obama couldn\u2019t bring his own most enthusiastic supporters to back him on an issue of national security,\u201d one supporter said. \u201cHow was he going to corral them for Larry?\u201d         \n\nMr. Summers\u2019s decision, which he shared with the president in a phone call Sunday followed by  \n, was described as reluctantly made and reluctantly accepted. Mr. Summers wanted the job and Mr. Obama wanted to pick him. But  \n on the Senate banking committee, the first step in the confirmation process, surprised the White House and forced a calculation that this was a battle the administration could not afford to fight.         \n\nThe embarrassing setback reveals an administration increasingly hamstrung by occasional opposition of liberal Democrats, not just its familiar Republican opponents. It adds to the rocky nature of Mr. Obama\u2019s fifth year, following the failure of a gun-rights bill, the stalling of an immigration overhaul and the lack of progress on a budget deal, on top of the back-and-forth over whether to conduct airstrikes in Syria to punish the Assad regime for a poison gas attack that killed hundreds of civilians.         \n\nThe withdrawal of Mr. Summers also leaves great uncertainty around the selection of a new Fed chairman, one of the most important economic policy decisions Mr. Obama will make in his second term. The successor to Ben S. Bernanke, the current chair, will shape how much longer and harder the Fed pushes to boost economic growth and reduce unemployment. The next Fed chairman will play a leading role in determining how forcefully the government seeks to constrain the financial industry.         \n\nWhite House officials have described Janet Yellen, the current vice chairwoman, as a finalist, and her candidacy has received widespread attention, but it remains unclear how seriously Mr. Obama is considering her. He does not know her well and White House aides have seemed unenthusiastic about her, despite the substantial support she enjoys from Democrats and outside economists.         \n\nIf Mr. Obama does not name her \u2014 or Timothy F. Geithner, the former Treasury Secretary and Fed official who is well-liked by the president but said to be uninterested in the job \u2014 many Fed watchers say they are uncertain where the president will turn.         \n\nMr. Bernanke plans to step down at the end of January, leaving ample time for the Senate to confirm a replacement, but the uncertainty has unsettled financial markets just as the Fed, which is beginning to retreat from its stimulus campaign, tries to assure investors that it will not move too quickly.         \n\nIn  \n on Sunday afternoon, Mr. Obama said he had accepted the decision by his friend, whom he praised for helping to rescue the country from the financial crisis that peaked in 2008.         \n\n\u201cLarry was a critical member of my team as we faced down the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, and it was in no small part because of his expertise, wisdom and leadership that we wrestled the economy back to growth and made the kind of progress we are seeing today,\u201d Mr. Obama said in the statement.         \n\nHe added: \u201cI will always be grateful to Larry for his tireless work and service on behalf of his country, and I look forward to continuing to seek his guidance and counsel in the future.\u201d         \n\nThe withdrawal ends an unusually public and contentious debate that began when the president declared in a televised interview in June that Mr. Bernanke would depart, opening the replacement process to public scrutiny before a nominee was even named.         \n\nMr. Summers had long been viewed by Mr. Obama and his economic advisers as Mr. Bernanke\u2019s presumptive replacement.
