{"headline": "Once Few, Women Hold More Power in Senate", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 An hour before her colleagues gathered for their first vote of a new Congress, Senator Kelly Ayotte slipped into an empty Senate chamber to savor the grandeur of her legislative home. As Ms. Ayotte, a freshman Republican from New Hampshire, sat down at the wooden desk where generations of lawmakers from her state had cast their votes, a doorman marched toward her with purpose.         \n\nThe desks, he sternly told her, were for senators only.         \n\nMs. Ayotte\u2019s induction that January day in 2011 into the most rarefied ranks of the nation\u2019s political class \u2014 female senators \u2014 had begun. \u201cThe desk thing really stuck with me,\u201d Ms. Ayotte said. \u201cThere still just aren\u2019t that many of us.\u201d         \n\nIn the 90 years since Rebecca Felton of Georgia became the first woman in the United States Senate \u2014 sworn in for a mere 24 hours \u2014 women remain an anomaly in the upper chamber. But with 20 female senators now in office, an all-time high, women have morphed from the curiosity they were for much of the 20th century into an important new force on key committees and legislation.         \n\nA record nine women now lead committees, including some of the most powerful ones. For the first time there is a woman \u2014 Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat \u2014 in charge of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which dispenses billions of dollars annually throughout the government and has long been particularly dominated by men. SenatorPatty Murray, a Washington Democrat, is the first chairwoman of the Budget Committee and is charged with shaping the Democratic strategy in the fiscal battle dominating Capitol Hill.         \n\nOne of the biggest bills to pass the Senate last year was farm legislation led by Senator Debbie Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat who presides over the agriculture committee. Senator Barbara Boxer, the California Democrat who is chairwoman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, shepherded the highway bill.         \n\n\u201cWe are growing in number,\u201d said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota. \u201cBut more importantly, we are growing in our power. When I first started just six years ago, it was unusual to have a woman managing a bill.\u201d         \n\nJust as important, even male senators say, is the potential the women hold for changing the tenor of the Senate and pushing for compromise in the highly partisan atmosphere on Capitol Hill.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to generalize, because this isn\u2019t true of all of them, but they tend to be interested in finding common ground,\u201d said Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio. \u201cSo I think it\u2019s going to have, and is having, a positive impact on the Senate.\u201d         \n\nWhile partisan division is the central characteristic of the modern Congress, women have begun to crack away at the gridlock by forming coalitions that have surprised leaders of both parties. Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, and Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, led the repeal in the Senate of \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d in 2010, allowing gay men and women to serve openly in the military.         \n\nThis year, all four of the female Senate Republicans split with their party and voted with Senate Democrats to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, which had lapsed during the last Congress.         \n\nBut politics remain just beneath the surface. In a recent roundtable involving the women and ABC\u2019s Diane Sawyer, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, sharply disagreed with Ms. Collins on the efforts the women should devote to reproductive rights. After Ms. Collins described reproductive issues as \u201csettled law\u201d and said \u201cI don\u2019t know why we would want to keep bringing those issues up,\u201d Ms. Warren shot back that \u201cI don\u2019t think they are entirely settled\u201d and that \u201cwe better speak out\u201d when there are attempts, for example, to limit health insurance coverage for birth control.         \n\n\u201cObviously there is so much more partisanship in recent years, and that has a spillover,\u201d saidOlympia J. Snowe, the moderate Republican former senator from Maine who left the Senate last year, dejected by the political polarization on Capitol Hill and what she described as her growing inability to reach across the aisle. But she called the 20 women \u201ca critical mass\u201d that she expected could \u201clargely effect change together.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/22/us/politics/women-make-new-gains-in-the-senate.html", "date": "2013-03-21", "description": "Female senators remain an anomaly, but with 20 now in office, they have become a new force on important committees and legislation."}
