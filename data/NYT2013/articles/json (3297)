{"headline": "Domestic Drones Stir Imaginations, and Concerns", "body": "\nGRAND FORKS, N.D. \u2014 On the pilot\u2019s computer screen, planted at ground level a few yards from the airport runway here, the data streaming across the display tracked an airplane at 1,300 feet above a small city on the coast, making perfect circles at 150 miles per hour.         \n\nTo the pilot\u2019s right, a sensor operator was aiming a camera on the plane to pan, tilt and zoom in a search among the houses on the ground for people who had been reported missing.         \n\nOn his screen, cartoonlike human figures appeared in a gathering around a camp fire between the houses.         \n\n\u201cThere they are,\u201d Andrew Regenhard, the pilot and a student, said in a flat tone that seemed out of place with a successful rescue mission.         \n\nIn fact, no one was missing; the entire exercise used imaginary props and locales. Mr. Regenhard was taking part in a training session at the University of North Dakota. The first to offer a degree program in unmanned aviation, the university is one of many academic settings, along with companies and individuals, preparing for a brave new world in which cheap remote-controlled airplanes will be ubiquitous in civilian air space, searching for everything from the most wanted of criminal suspects to a swarm of grasshoppers devouring a crop.         \n\n\u201cThe sky\u2019s going to be dark with these things,\u201d said Chris Anderson, the former editor of Wired, who started the hobbyist Web site  \n and now runs a company, 3D Robotics, that sells unmanned aerial vehicles and equipment. He says it is selling about as many drones every calendar quarter \u2014 about 7,500 \u2014 as the United States military flies in total.         \n\nThe burst of activity in remotely operated planes stems from the confluence of two factors: electronics and communications gear has become dirt cheap, enabling the conversion of hobbyist radio-controlled planes into sophisticated platforms for surveillance, and the  \n has been ordered by Congress to work out a way to integrate these aircraft into the national airspace by 2015.         \n\nThe rapidly expanding market has not gone unnoticed by lawmakers and privacy watchdogs. On Wednesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing on the privacy implications of drones like the ones being developed at Grand Forks.         \n\nSenator Patrick Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who is chairman of the committee, said this year: \u201cThis fast-emerging technology is cheap and could pose a significant threat to the privacy and civil liberties of millions of Americans. It is another example of a fast-changing policy area on which we need to focus to make sure that modern technology is not used to erode Americans\u2019 right to privacy.\u201d         \n\nSome fans of the technology wince at the word \u201cdrone,\u201d which implies that there is no pilot. And they have grown resentful about the alarms raised over privacy issues, noting that a few city and state governments have  \n even where they do not yet operate.         \n\nTom K. Kenville, chairman of the North Dakota chapter of the trade association, Unmanned Applications Institute, International, said such bans would discourage technological progress. \u201cI don\u2019t think we had rules for the road before we had roads,\u201d he said.         \n\nBack in the university lab, Rico Becker, a software developer with Corsair Engineering, which had written a program for the students, emphasized that the \u201cmissing persons\u201d exercise was just one of many hypothetical missions that students would fly, and was purely theoretical. \u201cWe\u2019re not training pilots to spot people camping in their backyards,\u201d he said.         \n\nAside from the missing persons mission, experts here outline a number of uses for the planes: \u201cprecision agriculture,\u201d with tiny planes inspecting crops several times a week for the first sign of blight or insect invasion; safety missions by semiautonomous flying machines that could cruise the two-mile length of a freight train and examine the air brakes on each car, far faster than a person could, and be available for accident assessment in case of derailment; inspection operations of pipelines or power lines, a job that is notoriously dangerous for helicopters, and scouting out fires or car crashes.         \n\nVolunteer fire departments in places like Grand Forks, Mr. Kenville said, would provide a clear market. An unmanned vehicle, he said, was \u201cgoing to beat all the cars there,\u201d to determine the scope of a problem.         \n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s a chemical fire, it will tell us to stay away, or it\u2019s just some hay bales, drive slower,\u201d he said.         \n\nRemote control equipment might even displace some human pilots, in the cockpits of cargo planes.
