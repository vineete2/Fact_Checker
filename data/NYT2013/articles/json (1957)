{"headline": "Lists That Rank Colleges\u2019 Value Are on the Rise", "body": "\nLooking out over the quadrangle before him as students dashed from one class to the next, James Muyskens was feeling proud one recent afternoon, and why not?         \n\nThe college he had led for the past 11 years had just been awarded second place in a new ranking of American higher education \u2014 ahead of flagship state universities, ahead of elite liberal arts colleges, even ahead of all eight Ivy League universities.         \n\nThe college is  \n, a part of the City University of New York with an annual tuition of $5,730, and a view of the Long Island Expressway.         \n\nCatering to working-class students, more than half of whom were born in other countries, Queens does not typically find itself at the top of national rankings. Then again, this was not a typical ranking. It was a list of colleges that offer the \u201cbest bang for the buck.\u201d         \n\n\u201cElation,\u201d said Dr. Muyskens, recalling his delight when he learned of the honor. \u201cThrilled!\u201d         \n\nPurists might regard such bottom-line calculations as an insult to the intellectual, social and civic value of education. But dollars-and-cents tabulations like that one (which was compiled by  \n), are the fastest-growing sector of the college rankings industry, with ever more analyses vying for the attention of high school students and their parents who are anxious about finances.         \n\nPresident Obama sharply raised the ante in August  \n to rate colleges on their value and affordability and to tie those ratings to the $150 billion in financial aid that the federal government supplies each year. Should Mr. Obama\u2019s plan come to pass, value would not just be a selling point for colleges, it would be a matter of life and death.         \n\nBut there is no agreement on how to measure the value of a college, and there is no agreement, or anything even close, on what value is in the first place.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a quest for the holy grail,\u201d said  \n, a professor of economics and education at Columbia University\u2019s Teachers College. \u201cIt sounds good, it sounds like something we\u2019d love to know, to be able to rank the value of these institutions, but when it comes down to practicalities, it\u2019s very, very difficult.\u201d         \n\nU.S. News and World Report, whose academic rankings have long been derided \u2014 and obsessively followed \u2014 by college presidents, now publishes  \n lists as well.         \n\nPrinceton Review, which has advised decades of prospective students on the best party schools, more recently began listing the  \n schools, too.         \n\nForbes Magazine got in the is-it-worth-the-money game too, as did, among others, The Wall Street Journal, The Alumni Factor, Kiplinger\u2019s Personal Finance and  \n, a company that gathers data about the job market.         \n\nSome of these analyses approach value as largely a function of cost: How much is tuition? What subsidies are available? Others define it as return on investment: How much do graduates earn? Some factor in student satisfaction or academic ranking or graduation rates or economic diversity, all in varying quantities.         \n\nThese widely divergent definitions produce wildly divergent results. Queens College did splendidly in a list that emphasizes social mobility and civic virtue. Another New York City public college, Baruch, took third place; No. 1 was Amherst.         \n\nBut on a ranking that emphasizes alumni salaries, like Payscale\u2019s list of Colleges Worth Your Investment, Queens comes in 341st. The top spot there goes to  \n, in Claremont, Calif., which has a much higher tuition, but whose graduates disproportionately enter lucrative fields like science and engineering. The top tier of U.S. News\u2019s list somehow features Harvard, Princeton, Williams \u2014 and  \n, a tiny Buddhist college in Southern California that admitted its first undergraduates in 2001.         \n\nForbes\u2019s most recent list starts out with the five national service academies, which charge no tuition. And when the Education Trust, an advocacy group, set out to list the colleges that do right by low-income students, it found only five entries, including Queens.         \n\nAs for the federal government, no one yet knows how it will perform its evaluation. Arne Duncan, the education secretary, has said that his goal is a ratings system, not a single first-place-to-last-place ranking, and that the ratings will compare only schools that are similar in their mission, their student population and so on. Harvard and Yale, that is; not Harvard and Soka University of America.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be looking at access,\u201d Mr. Duncan said in a recent speech, \u201csuch as the percentage of students receiving Pell grants. We\u2019ll be looking at affordability, like average tuition, scholarships and loan debt. And we\u2019ll be looking at outcomes, such as graduation and transfer rates, alumni satisfaction surveys, graduate earnings and the advanced degrees of college graduates.\u201d         \n\nIn search of the best way to measure those categories, and of other kinds of information that ought to be included, Education Department officials will soon fan out across the country for months of town hall meetings, school forums and interviews. The plan is to compile the ratings by the start of the 2015-16 school year and to link those ratings to federal aid by 2018.         \n\nBut  \n, a Stanford professor and an author of  \n about the failures of college as an engine for social mobility, said the effort is doomed to fail.
