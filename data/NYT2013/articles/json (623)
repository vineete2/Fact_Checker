{"headline": "With Royal Baby Due in Britain, Street Is a Waiting Zone", "body": "\nLONDON \u2014 Waiting around for someone else to give birth can be a slow and tedious marathon of an experience. But for the photographers and cameramen on royal baby-watch outside St. Mary\u2019s Hospital in Paddington, the monotony has entered another stratosphere entirely.         \n\n\u201cAt least when it\u2019s your wife, you don\u2019t go to the hospital until the wife\u2019s in labor,\u201d said Harry Rabbie, a BBC cameraman and father of two who spent much of Wednesday slumped inside the makeshift journalists\u2019 refugee camp on the street outside St. Mary\u2019s, passing the time with a romance novel titled \u201cThe Tycoon\u2019s Seductive Revenge.\u201d \u201cThis could happen 15 to 20 days after the due date,\u201d he continued, speaking from personal experience, \u201ceven if we knew what the due date was.\u201d         \n\nBritain is in high baby-anticipation mode, and the stores are flooded with items like \u201c \n. But the truth is murky. There has been no official announcement about what day the baby in question, the first child of Prince William and the duchess formerly known as Kate Middleton, is expected to arrive. Despite one tabloid\u2019s bold piece of information \u2014 B-Day is this Saturday, it declared \u2014 Buckingham Palace has said exactly one thing about the matter, and that was six months ago.         \n\n\u201cTheir Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are delighted to confirm they are expecting a baby in July,\u201d the palace said.         \n\nThe photographers and cameramen duly set up camp on July 1, using masking tape to mark out territory for their stepladders. The month is one-third over, and there are no obvious signs that anything is happening. The duchess made her last scheduled public appearance on June 15, when she and her in-laws took part in the annual ritual known as  \n, which involves a lot of pageantry, including a military flyover and the requisite royal family appearance on the Buckingham Palace balcony. She wore a pink outfit and a pink hat, and she looked good.         \n\nIt is unclear where she is now, but the main choices seem to be at her marital home in Kensington Palace or with her parents in the country. Meanwhile, Prince William is reportedly still at work as a Royal Air Force search-and-rescue helicopter pilot in Anglesey, Wales, where he reportedly has a helicopter on permanent standby, ready to take off the moment his wife shows signs of labor. (\u201c \n,\u201d The Daily Mail reported.)         \n\nWe do know some things for sure, because Buckingham Palace has thrown us a few bones of information, maintaining its usual aura of semi-helpful but distant majesty. We know that the baby will be known as the Prince (or Princess) of Cambridge. We know that, thanks to recent changes in the law of royal succession, she (or he) will be the third in line to the throne, after Prince Charles, 64, and Prince William, 31, and that poor Prince Harry will be bounced down to fourth place. (It could take some time for this future monarch to become the current monarch. Queen Elizabeth is now 87 years old, but she is not the abdicating kind, and there are longevity genes in the family; her own mother lived to be 102.)         \n\nWe know that when the baby comes, the news will go out the old-fashioned way, by proclamation. A document signed by the medical team and revealing the sex of the child will be taken from the hospital and placed on an easel installed inside the Buckingham Palace gates, ready to be gaped at by tourists and other passers-by. Only then will the palace release the news on social media. \u201cThere is no intention of announcing this first on Twitter,\u201d a palace spokeswoman said.         \n\nWe know that the medical team will be led by Marcus Setchell, the royal household\u2019s official surgeon and gynecologist. We know that Prince William plans to take time off once his baby arrives. \u201cHe will be working right up to the end, and then he will take two weeks standard paternity leave,\u201d the spokeswoman said.         \n\nWe know that bookmakers, eager to capitalize on the British love of gambling, have been taking bets on anything and everything: length of labor, time of birth, sex of baby, name of baby. (The current favorite names, based on nothing but public opinion, are Elizabeth, Alexandra, Charlotte and Diana for girls, and George and James for boys.)         \n\nThe rest of the things fall into the category of amusing but hazily sourced speculation. Will Kate\u2019s mother, Carole Middleton, be with her during her labor? Does Mr. Setchell \u2014 surgeons in Britain do not use the honorific \u201cDr.\u201d \u2014 have a specially encrypted cellphone on which he communicates with the royal family? Is the prime minister of Australia planning to give the royal couple a stuffed kangaroo as a baby present?         \n\nWill Kate and William ever use the items \u2014 diaper rash cream, a pacifier and a packet of condoms, among other things \u2014 in the box sent by the Finnish government and given as a matter of course to Finnish mothers-to-be? Is it true that Kate is not \u201ctoo posh to push,\u201d and plans to have a natural birth, not a Caesarean? What kind of post-baby exercise regime will her superfit sister, Pippa, subject her to?         \n\nMeanwhile, the wait continues. A small frisson of excitement shivered through the crowd outside St. Mary\u2019s on Wednesday, when a helicopter was spotted overhead, but it turned out to contain a regular citizen having a health emergency, not a duchess having a baby.         \n\nIn truth, no one is even sure that people are in fact waiting in the correct place. The journalists\u2019 camp is set up at the front entrance to the Lindo Wing, a private ward of the hospital. This is where Prince William \u2014 the first heir to the throne to be born in a hospital, rather than at home \u2014 was himself born, in 1982, and where the new baby is also reportedly to be born.         \n\nBut is this the right entrance? The photographers said that they were waiting at the front door for one reason alone, to grab a shot of Kate as she makes the historic journey from vehicle to hospital. But the palace seemed to throw cold water on that plan. \u201cWe will not be talking about how she will get there,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cOnce she is safely inside, we will confirm that she is inside.\u201d         \n\nThe police officers on duty had nothing useful to add. \u201cThere\u2019s always a back entrance,\u201d noted one, \u201calthough I\u2019m not privileged with that information.\u201d         \n\nNor was the security guard stationed outside any the wiser. He sounded a little wistful. \u201cThey don\u2019t tell me anything, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d he said.
