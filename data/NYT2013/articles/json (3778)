{"headline": "House G.O.P. Raises Stakes in Debt-Ceiling Fight", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 With no serious negotiations in sight, a disorderly and divided Congress slipped closer to a double-barreled fiscal crisis on Thursday as House Republican leaders tried to shift the budget dispute to a fight over raising the government\u2019s borrowing limit.         \n\nTrying to round up votes from a reluctant rank and file, House Republicans said they would agree to increase the debt limit to avert a mid-October default only if Democrats accepted a list of Republican priorities, including a one-year delay of the health care law, a tax overhaul and a broad rollback of environmental regulations.         \n\nAt the same time, Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio signaled he was not ready to abandon a spending fight that could shut down the federal government as soon as Tuesday. Asked whether he would put a stopgap spending bill to a vote free of Republican policy prescriptions, he answered, \u201cI do not see that happening.\u201d         \n\nPresident Obama, who has faced three years of down-to-the-wire standoffs that have nearly ended in default or shutdowns a half-dozen times, fired back with a broadside of his own.         \n\n\u201cNo Congress before this one has ever, ever, in history been irresponsible enough to threaten default, to threaten an economic shutdown, to suggest America not pay its bills, just to try to blackmail a president into giving them some concessions on issues that have nothing to do with a budget,\u201d Mr. Obama said before a friendly audience in suburban Washington.         \n\nThe bitter back and forth in the absence of any high-level discussions between Republicans and Democrats was seen as increasing the possibility of a shutdown or default. It was a marked contrast from past showdowns when talks were taking place behind the scenes even as the parties traded public partisan shots.         \n\nThe Senate faces a critical vote on Friday to cut off debate on legislation to keep the government open. If Democrats muster 60 votes, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, will move to strip out House language that guts the health care law and pass a stopgap spending bill that finances the government through Nov. 15, without Republican policy prescriptions.         \n\nAt that point, no one is sure how the House will react.         \n\n\u201cThere is no secret room where everyone is sitting down and hashing this out,\u201d said Senator Patty Murray, the Washington Democrat who is chairwoman of the Senate Budget Committee.         \n\nRepresentative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader, encouraged Democrats to come to the table.         \n\n\u201cWe call on the president to sit down with us, Harry Reid to sit down with us, and let\u2019s resolve this problem,\u201d he said.         \n\nBut in their efforts to unify restive Republicans, House leaders were only widening the partisan divisions. Behind closed doors on Thursday, they laid out their demands for a debt ceiling increase that include the health law delay, fast-track authority to overhaul the tax code, construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, offshore oil and gas production and more permitting of energy exploration on federal lands.         \n\nThe legislation would also roll back regulations on coal ash, block new Environmental Protection Agency regulations on greenhouse gas production, eliminate a $23 billion fund to ensure the orderly dissolution of failed major banks, eliminate mandatory contributions to the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, limit medical malpractice lawsuits and increase means testing for Medicare, among other provisions.         \n\nEven with that legislative Christmas tree, many Republican backbenchers balked. After introducing the measure to his divided troops, a sheepish speaker of the House faced the press with a grimace. \u201cOh, this ought to be a blast,\u201d Mr. Boehner sighed as he opened a news conference for questions.         \n\nSenator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the No. 2 Democrat, derided the proposal. \u201cThe House is attaching the Republican Party platform to the debt ceiling,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a week full of absurdities, this one takes the cake.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/27/us/politics/house-gop-leaders-list-conditions-for-raising-debt-ceiling.html", "date": "2013-09-26", "description": "With no serious negotiations in sight, a disorderly and divided Congress slipped closer to a double-barreled fiscal crisis."}
