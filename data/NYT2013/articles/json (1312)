{"headline": "Austerity Kills Government Jobs as Cuts to Budgets Loom", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The federal government, the nation\u2019s largest consumer and investor, is cutting back at a pace exceeded in the last half-century only by the military demobilizations after the Vietnam War and the cold war.         \n\nAnd the turn toward austerity is set to accelerate on Friday if the mandatory federal spending cuts known as sequestration start to take effect as scheduled. Those cuts would join an earlier round of deficit reduction measures passed in 2011 and the wind-down of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that already have reduced the federal government\u2019s contribution to the nation\u2019s gross domestic product by almost 7 percent in the last two years.         \n\nThe cuts may be felt more deeply because state and local governments \u2014 which expanded rapidly during earlier rounds of federal reductions in the 1970s and the 1990s, offsetting much of the impact \u2014 have also been cutting back.         \n\nFederal, state and local governments now employ 500,000 fewer workers than they did on the eve of the recession in 2007, the longest and deepest decline in total government employment since the aftermath of World War II.         \n\nTotal government spending continues to increase, but those broader figures include benefit programs like  \n. Government purchases and investments expand the nation\u2019s economy, just as private sector transactions do, while benefit programs move money from one group of people to another without directly expanding economic activity.         \n\nThe  \n and other economic forecasters say that the latest round of government austerity is not likely to return the economy to recession, thanks to stronger private sector growth. But the spending cutbacks and actions to raise taxes could reduce growth by roughly 1.5 percentage points this year, according to the Congressional Budget Office, leaving the sluggish economy operating well below capacity.         \n\nIn testimony to lawmakers on Tuesday, the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, urged Congress and the Obama administration to replace the scheduled budget cuts with a plan to reduce federal deficits more gradually.         \n\n\u201cAlthough monetary policy is working to promote a more robust recovery, it cannot carry the entire burden of ensuring a speedier return to economic health,\u201d Mr. Bernanke said. He warned that the combination of previous spending cuts and the looming mandatory reductions \u201ccould create a significant headwind for the economic recovery.\u201d         \n\nThe shrinking government is a normal response to an extraordinary situation. Government spending generally rises during recessions and falls as the economy recovers. Spending always declines at the end of one war, let alone two. And three years after a recession, the American economy typically is restored to full bloom.         \n\nBut this time is different. Growth has remained sluggish and millions remain unemployed even as the federal government, riven by partisan differences, has largely turned its attention to deficit reduction.         \n\nMr. Bernanke, like many critics of sequestration, said the government could not ignore the need to reduce its annual deficits and curtail the growth of its debt. But he said short-term cuts would worsen those problems by slowing the economy. Moreover, sequestration mostly spares  \n and  \n, the health care programs that are the primary reason federal spending is projected to increase.         \n\nCongress and the administration, he said, should \u201cintroduce these cuts more gradually and compensate with larger and more sustained cuts in the future.\u201d         \n\nOthers, however, say that it makes no sense to postpone inevitable cuts. They note that government cutbacks may cause short-term pain, but also tend to provide long-term benefits by making resources available to the private sector.         \n\n\u201cPeople focus on the upfront cost and they don\u2019t think through the whole timeline,\u201d said Tyler Cowen, an economist at George Mason University and an occasional contributor to the Sunday Business section of The New York Times. \u201cYou have to cut spending within the next 10 years anyway. It may be time to take some lumps.\u201d         \n\nThe current round of austerity does not yet approach the depth or the duration of the earlier round of cutbacks. Between 1969 and 1974, as spending on the Vietnam War declined, the government reduced consumption and investment by 24 percent after adjusting for inflation. Between 1991 and 1999, the government reduced consumption and investment by an inflation-adjusted 14 percent.
