{"headline": "Check In, Act Out", "body": "\nIn the 1980s, Harold Macmillan, the former English prime minister, was informed by someone that a historic British estate called Cliveden House had been turned into a hotel. \u201cBut my dear boy,\u201d Mr. Macmillan is said to have replied, \u201cit always has been.\u201d         \n\nSet on the Thames, about 30 miles west of London, with formal gardens, tennis courts and a swimming pool, Cliveden (pronounced CLIF-den) had all the trappings of a luxury resort long before it took in paying lodgers. When its last private owners, the Astor family, lived there, the guests who passed through were as varied as Lawrence of Arabia, Mahatma Gandhi, Charlie Chaplin and a Harley Street osteopath named Dr. Stephen Ward. Dr. Ward had treated the third Viscount Astor for a bad back after a hunting fall and was rewarded with an inexpensive lease on Spring Cottage, a quaint house on the estate that he used as a weekend home.         \n\nAnd, as often happens with hotels, a fairy-tale setting became a backdrop for imprudent behavior.         \n\nIn July 1961, at the Cliveden pool, Dr. Ward introduced his friend Christine Keeler, a 19-year-old showgirl, to John Profumo, a minister in Mr. Macmillan\u2019s cabinet. Ms. Keeler was stark naked. Mr. Profumo offered her his jacket. Their brief affair was complicated less by Mr. Profumo\u2019s marital status (his wife was the actress Valerie Hobson) than by his job (he was secretary of state for war at the time of the cold war, and Ms. Keeler was simultaneously sleeping with a Russian naval attach\u00e9, who was suspected of espionage).         \n\nThe ripples from the scandal ultimately helped to bring down the Macmillan government. On Sept. 25, 1963, an official report was released on the Profumo affair, and Mr. Macmillan resigned a month later, citing poor health. A year later, the Labour Party, led by Harold Wilson, took over.         \n\nAlmost 50 years to the day after the government\u2019s report was issued, a frisson still animates Cliveden. Michael Chaloner, house manager at the hotel, said that it is a rare day that a guest doesn\u2019t bring up the Profumo business. And Spring Cottage, a former home of its catalyst, Dr. Ward, attracts particular interest. Once a summer house that accommodated visits from Queen Victoria, the three-bedroom building, which is rented to guests seeking a secluded riverside idyll, was recently renovated by Martin Hulbert, a London designer, under Cliveden\u2019s current owner, SRE Hotels. (The National Trust in Britain manages the estate\u2019s 376 acres.)         \n\nWhy are hotels such notorious settings for bad behavior? And why do people continue to flock to places where the perfume of scandal, or even tragedy, lingers?         \n\nIt has been a busy summer for hotel scandals. In July, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former head of the International Monetary Fund charged with assaulting a housekeeper at the Sofitel New York two years ago, was indicted on a charge of involvement with a prostitution ring at the Hotel Carlton in Lille, France. That month, too, the actress Emma Roberts was arrested in an undisclosed Montreal hotel on the suspicion of beating up her boyfriend. And Nicholas Brooks, son of the songwriter Joseph Brooks, was convicted of strangling and drowning his girlfriend in a bathtub at the private residential club Soho House New York. Last month, tabloid writers were chattering about Lamar Odom, the basketball-playing husband of Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, who had decamped earlier this summer to the Roosevelt Hotel in Los Angeles, reputedly with a girlfriend.         \n\n\u201cHistorically, of course, the hotel bedroom has been the scene of many a drama,\u201d said Ilse Crawford, the original designer of Soho House New York. \u201cAnd this is partly because it is a private world. It\u2019s away and unaccountable and not visible.\u201d         \n\nNor are bedrooms the only incubators of extreme behavior at hotels, Ms. Crawford added. The public spaces can lower one\u2019s inhibitions, too, because they are areas of aspiration \u2014 which is to say, role-playing. Ever since the birth of the modern hotel in the early 19th century as a place where ordinary people were surrounded by aristocratic trappings, the idea was that you could enter \u201ca life that isn\u2019t one that you\u2019re a part of,\u201d Ms. Crawford said. \u201cIt\u2019s a dream, in a way.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/12/garden/check-in-act-out.html", "date": "2013-09-11", "description": "What is it about hotel design that encourages people to drop their inhibitions and indulge in bad behavior?"}
