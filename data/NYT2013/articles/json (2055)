{"headline": "Ronaldo\u2019s 3 Goals Carry Portugal to World Cup Berth", "body": "\nThe original pool of hopefuls had 207 teams, a diverse group of soccer nations ranging from minnows to monoliths that nonetheless had a common destination in mind. Now, more than 800 qualifying matches later, the field of 32 teams that will take part in the World Cup next year in Brazil is all but complete.         \n\n \n provided a fitting conclusion to the final significant day of qualifying, delivering a sublime performance in Solna, Sweden, in which he scored three goals in Tuesday\u2019s second leg and all four of Portugal\u2019s goals over all in its two-game aggregate series victory over Sweden. Ronaldo\u2019s masterpiece \u2014 which he punctuated with a demonstrative celebration in front of the dismayed Swedish fans \u2014 gave Portugal a 3-2 victory and qualified its team for its fourth consecutive World Cup.         \n\nIt also knocked out the Swedish superstar Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who scored two goals Tuesday but could not keep pace with the resurgent Ronaldo. \u201cI know Portugal needed me in these matches and I showed I am here,\u201d Ronaldo told Portuguese television.         \n\nRonaldo\u2019s showing was the most memorable development on a day thatfeatured few surprises. Iceland\u2019s bid to become the smallest nation at a World Cup was sunk by Croatia, which won by 2-0 in Zagreb. Burkina Faso was denied its first World Cup berth when it lost to Algeria. And Egypt could not overturn a five-goal deficit against Ghana, almost surely dooming its American coach, Bob Bradley, to an eventual ouster. Bradley essentially said goodbye to Egypt at his prematch news conference, providing a conclusion to a two-year tenure that will be remembered for remarkable success amid the country\u2019s political strife.         \n\nThe most shocking result \u2014 though it was not an outright stunner \u2014 came from Paris, where France rallied after an ugly first leg against Ukraine and avoided missing out on the World Cup for the first time since 1994. Goals from Mamadou Sakho and Karim Benzema, along with an own goal by Ukraine, allowed France to win, 3-0, and turn around its 2-0 defeat in the first leg.         \n\nFrance is one of 13 European countries that will play in Brazil, joining the fourth playoff winner, Greece, as well as Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, England, Spain, Russia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Belgium and Switzerland. Japan, Iran, South Korea and Australia will represent the Asian confederation while Ghana, Algeria, Ivory Coast, Nigeria and Cameroon will go from Africa. Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Chile and Ecuador have confirmed spots from South America. The United States, Costa Rica and Honduras qualified from North American and Central America.         \n\nThe final two spots to be determined are virtually booked as well: Mexico is set to face New Zealand early Wednesday in Wellington, and Uruguay will host Jordan in Montevideo. Both Mexico and Uruguay hold sizable first-leg leads that should be enough to see them through.         \n\nUltimately, it will make for a compelling show over a month of games next June and July in 12 Brazilian cities. Assuming Uruguay advances, every country that has won a World Cup will play in Brazil. The majority of the game\u2019s top stars \u2014 save for Sweden\u2019s Ibrahimovic, Wales\u2019s Gareth Bale and Poland\u2019s Robert Lewandowski \u2014 should also take part, adding even more drama to the draw on Dec. 6.         \n\nThat event, which will be held near Salvador in Brazil, will determine the eight four-team groups for the finals, as well as the schedule of games in the group stage. The tournament begins June 12 in S\u00e3o Paulo, with the final set for July 13 in Rio de Janeiro.         \n\nNotes         \n\nMarc Janko scored in the 33rd minute after lax defensive marking, and the United States fell, 1-0, to host Austria in a friendly. The United States finished the year with a team-record 16 victories and qualified for its seventh straight World Cup. Austria failed to qualify. ...Per Mertesacker\u2019s header gave Germany a 1-0 win in a friendly at Wembley Stadium and sent England to back-to-back home losses for the first time in 36 years. While Germany deployed a second-string lineup \u2014 and took control after taking the lead \u2014 England started with a strong lineup as it prepares for the World Cup.  \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/19/sports/soccer/19reuters-soccer-world-portugal-qualify.html", "date": "2013-11-19", "description": "A second-half hat trick by Cristiano Ronaldo took Portugal to the World Cup finals with a 4-2 aggregate victory in its World Cup playoff against Sweden on Tuesday."}
