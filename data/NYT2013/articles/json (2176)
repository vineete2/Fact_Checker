{"headline": "Amsterdam Has a Deal for Alcoholics: Work Paid in Beer", "body": "\nAMSTERDAM \u2014 After more than a decade out of work because of a back injury and chronic alcoholism, Fred Schiphorst finally landed a job last year and is determined to keep it. He gets up at 5:30 a.m., walks his dog and then puts on a red tie, ready to clean litter from the streets of eastern Amsterdam.         \n\n\u201cYou have to look sharp,\u201d said Mr. Schiphorst, 60, a former construction worker.         \n\nHis workday begins unfailingly at 9 a.m. \u2014 with two cans of beer, a down payment on a salary paid mostly in alcohol. He gets two more cans at lunch and then another can or, if all goes smoothly, two to round off a productive day.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not proud of being an alcoholic, but I am proud to have a job again,\u201d said Mr. Schiphorst, the grateful beneficiary of an unusual government-funded program to lure alcoholics off the streets by paying them in beer to pick up trash.         \n\nIn addition to beer \u2014 the brand varies depending on which brewery offers the best price \u2014 each member of the cleaning team gets half a packet of rolling tobacco, free lunch and 10 euros a day, or about $13.55.         \n\nThe program, started last year by the  \n, a private but mostly government-funded organization that helps the homeless, drug addicts and alcoholics get back on their feet, is so popular that there is a long waiting list of chronic alcoholics eager to join the beer-fueled cleaning teams.         \n\nOne of the project\u2019s most enthusiastic supporters is Fatima Elatik, district mayor of eastern Amsterdam. As a practicing Muslim who wears a head scarf, Ms. Elatik personally disapproves of alcohol but says she believes that alcoholics \u201ccannot be just ostracized\u201d and told to shape up. It is better, she said, to give them something to do and restrict their drinking to a limited amount of beer with no hard alcohol.         \n\nConservative members of the Amsterdam City Council have derided what they call the \u201cbeer project\u201d as a waste of government money and a misguided extension of a culture of tolerance that has already made the city a mecca for marijuana users and spawned Europe\u2019s best-known red-light district.         \n\nHans Wijnands, the director of the Rainbow Foundation, dismissed such complaints as political grandstanding at a time when, even in the Netherlands, \u201cit is becoming more fashionable to support repressive measures.\u201d Alarmed by what it said was a rise in crime caused by liberal drug laws, the Dutch government announced a plan in 2010 to bar foreigners from buying cannabis in so-called coffee shops, which sell marijuana and hashish legally. Amsterdam\u2019s mayor ordered city police to ignore the ban, which was supposed to go into effect nationwide this year.         \n\nThe idea of providing alcoholics with beer in return for work, he said, was first tried in Canada. It took off in the Netherlands in part because the country has traditionally shunned \u201czero tolerance\u201d in response to addiction. Amsterdam now has three districts running beer-for-work street cleaning programs, and a fourth discussing whether to follow suit. Other Dutch cities are looking into the idea, too.         \n\nThe basic idea is to extend to alcoholics an approach first developed to help heroin addicts, who have for years been provided with free methadone, a less dangerous substitute, in a controlled environment that provides access to health workers and counselors.         \n\n\u201cIf you just say, \u2018Stop drinking and we will help you,\u2019 it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d said Mr. Wijnands, whose foundation gets 80 percent of its financing from the state and runs four drug consumption rooms with free needles for hardened addicts. \u201cBut if you say, \u2018I will give you work for a few cans of beer during the day,\u2019 they like it.\u201d         \n\nTo shield the government from criticism that it is subsidizing drinking, the Rainbow Foundation insists that it pays for the beer given to Mr. Schiphorst and his fellow alcoholics out of its own funds. \u201cFor the government, it is hard to say, \u2018We buy beer for a particular group of people,\u2019 because other people will say, \u2018I would like some beer, too,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Wijnands said.
