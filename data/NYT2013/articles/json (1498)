{"headline": "Should Unsupportive Relatives Be Invited to Same-Sex Wedding?", "body": "\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n Well, with any luck \u2014 and five of the nine Supreme Court justices voting to invalidate  \n \u2014 you fellows may be able to marry in California before long. Regardless of how the high court rules, support is growing for same-sex marriage, with a  \nof Americans now in favor. But when I dug deeper into the data I was surprised to learn from a  \n that only 38 percent of boomers (your parents\u2019 cohort) support same-sex marriage (compared to 70 percent of Millennials). Even more surprising, \u201cthe boomers aren\u2019t keeping pace with the rate of change seen in other generations,\u201d said Michael Dimock, director of the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press.         \n\nBut I also learned that nearly one-third of those who have changed their minds did so \u201cbecause they know someone \u2013 a friend, family member or other acquaintance \u2013 who is homosexual.\u201d As  \n, Republican of Ohio, recently discovered when his son came out, it\u2019s a lot harder to oppose marriage equality once you realize how close to home gay can be. Reasonably intelligent, highly educated people, as you call your relatives, tend to have that \u201caha!\u201d moment when they see how antigay sentiment hurts their own loved ones.         \n\nSo, here\u2019s my advice: Take the high road and invite all your family members, even if you think they don\u2019t support your relationship. After all, it takes an awfully cold-hearted person to sit through a wedding ceremony and not be moved \u2013 if not to tears, at least to acceptance. Consider this a unique opportunity to change some hearts and minds.         \n\nHowever, as much as you\u2019d like to require your guests to take a \u201cpledge\u201d of acceptance as part of their R.S.V.P., you can\u2019t. But you can word your invitation like this:         \n\n\u201cYou are invited to come and support us as we commit to our life together.\u201d         \n\nIf your relatives check the \u201cwill attend\u201d box, they\u2019ll know perfectly well what\u2019s expected of them because etiquette tells us \u201cwhat to do\u201d (show up on time, give a gift, put on your happy face). Alas, it falls short in telling us \u201chow to feel\u201d (as you wrote. \u201cto actually celebrate\u201d the occasion). For those who can\u2019t support your marriage, they\u2019re completely within their rights to decline the invitation; in fact, they should.         \n\nI know some will disagree vehemently with my advice here, latching on to the groundswell of feeling summed up movingly \u2014 \u201cOur Day, Our Way!\u201d \u2014 in the season finale of \u201c \n\u201d (\u201cTwo Weddings and a Baby\u201d). When I posted your question on  \n, several echoed this one:         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nWell, yes and no. A few months ago I answered a  \n who was planning to boycott his straight niece\u2019s wedding as a form of political protest (because he and his partner cannot marry in their home state). I urged him to go because in my book \u201cfamily trumps politics\u201d and because attending would be an expression of his love for his niece, not a statement on marriage rights. In the same vein for your parents or siblings, accepting an invitation to an L.G.B.T. family member\u2019s wedding doesn\u2019t mean anyone has become a champion of marriage equality. It simply means standing with family and remembering that the best love is the unconditional kind.         \n\nAs for your nieces and nephews, odds are they will end up as your most staunch defenders someday. Why not invite one or more of them to join your wedding party (flower girl, ring bearer) and help create the change you\u2019re seeking. In the meantime, let\u2019s not forget that your boomer relatives need a little remedial help in accepting same-sex marriage.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/16/booming/should-unsupportive-relatives-be-invited-to-same-sex-wedding.html", "date": "2013-04-16", "description": "A gay couple is advised to take the high road and hope to change the hearts of disapproving family members."}
