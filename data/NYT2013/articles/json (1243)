{"headline": "Bones Under Parking Lot Belonged to Richard III", "body": "\nLEICESTER, England \u2014 Until it was discovered beneath a city parking lot last fall, the skeleton had lain unmarked, and unmourned, for more than 500 years. Friars fearful of the men who slew him in battle buried the man in haste, naked and anonymous, without a winding sheet, rings or personal adornments of any kind, in a space so cramped his cloven skull was jammed upright and askew against the head of his shallow grave.         \n\nOn Monday, confirming what many historians and archaeologists had suspected, a team of experts at the University of Leicester concluded on the basis of DNA and other evidence that the skeletal remains were those of King Richard III, for centuries the most reviled of English monarchs. But the conclusion, said to have been reached \u201cbeyond any reasonable doubt,\u201d promised to achieve much more than an end to the oblivion that has been Richard\u2019s fate since his death on Aug. 22, 1485, at the Battle of Bosworth Field, 20 miles from this ancient city in the sheep country of England\u2019s East Midlands.         \n\nAmong those who  \n, there is a passionate belief that new attention drawn to Richard by the discovery will inspire a reappraisal that could rehabilitate the medieval king and show him to be a man with a strong sympathy for the rights of the common man, who was deeply wronged by his vengeful Tudor successors. Far from the villainous character memorialized in English histories, films and novels, far from Shakespeare\u2019s damning representation of him as the limping, withered, haunted murderer of his two princely nephews, Richard III can become the subject of a new age of scholarship and popular reappraisal, these enthusiasts believe.         \n\n\u201cI think he wanted to be found, he was ready to be found, and we found him, and now we can begin to tell the true story of who he was,\u201d said Philippa Langley, a writer who has been a longtime and fervent member of the  \n, an organization that has worked for decades to bring what it sees as justice to an unjustly vilified man. \u201cNow,\u201d Ms. Langley added, \u201cwe can rebury him with honor, and we can rebury him as a king.\u201d         \n\nOther members of the team at the University of Leicester pointed to Ms. Langley as the inspiration behind the project, responsible for raising much of the estimated $250,000 \u2014 with major contributions from unnamed Americans \u2014 it cost to carry out the exhumation and the research that led to confirmation that indeed Richard had been found.         \n\nMs. Langley\u2019s account was that her research for a play about the king had led her to a hunch that Richard\u2019s body would be found beneath the parking lot, in a corner of the buried ruins of the Greyfriars Priory, where John Rouse, a medieval historian writing in Latin within a few years after Richard\u2019s death, had recorded him as having been buried. Other unverified accounts said the king\u2019s body had been thrown by a mob into the River Soar, a mile or more from the priory.         \n\nRichard Taylor, the University of Leicester official who served as a coordinator for the project, said the last piece of the scientific puzzle fell into place with DNA findings that became available on Sunday, five months after the skeletal remains were uncovered. At that point, he said, members of the team knew that they had achieved something historic.         \n\n\u201cWe knew then, beyond reasonable doubt, that this was Richard III,\u201d Mr. Taylor said. \u201cWe\u2019re certain now, as certain as you can be of anything in life.\u201d         \n\nThe team\u2019s leading geneticist, Turi King, said at a news conference that DNA samples from two modern-day descendants of Richard III\u2019s family had provided a match with samples taken from the skeleton found in the priory ruins. Kevin Schurer, a historian and demographer, tracked down two living descendants of Anne of York, Richard III\u2019s sister, one of them a London-based, Canadian-born furniture maker, Michael Ibsen, 55, and the other a second cousin of Mr. Ibsen\u2019s who has requested anonymity.         \n\nDr. King said tests conducted at three laboratories in England and France had found that the descendants\u2019 mitochondrial DNA, a genetic element inherited through the maternal line of descent, matched that extracted from the parking lot skeleton. She said all three samples belonged to a type of mitochondrial DNA that is carried by only 1 to 2 percent of the English population, a rare enough group to satisfy the project team, pending more work on the samples, that a match had been found.         \n\nWhen she studied the results for the first time, she said, she \u201cwent very quiet, then did a little dance around the laboratory.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/world/europe/richard-the-third-bones.html", "date": "2013-02-04", "description": "In one of Britain\u2019s most dramatic modern archaeological finds, tests identified the remains of the reviled English monarch, a discovery that could lead to a reassessment of his reign."}
