{"headline": "Fates of Brooks and Coulson in Tabloid Hacking Case Are Diverging", "body": "\nLONDON \u2014 Once they were friends and colleagues who reveled in the heady world of British news, politics and intrigue. Together they rose from the scrappy newsrooms of London\u2019s tabloids to the heights of establishment power, she as head of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s British newspaper empire, he as Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s chief spokesman. For six years they were lovers, carrying on their affair even as each married someone else.         \n\nNow Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson are together again, this time in the dock at the Old Bailey, London\u2019s main criminal court, facing charges of illegally intercepting voice messages and other crimes in connection with their work for Mr. Murdoch\u2019s now-defunct News of the World tabloid.         \n\nSince their arrests, their lives have sharply diverged.         \n\nThough they sit side by side in court, it is not by choice; their seats are assigned. Nothing about their body language suggests their  \n of intimacy. They bid each other good morning and good evening, but there is little more than that. When the prosecution read out a steamy letter from Ms. Brooks to Mr. Coulson as evidence of their affair, she looked uneasily down at her lap; he stared straight ahead.         \n\nMs. Brooks, 45, a  \n who worked as chief executive of Mr. Murdoch\u2019s News International before resigning when the phone hacking scandal engulfed her in the summer of 2011, never lost the support of the man who was her boss, friend, mentor and protector.         \n\nShe walked away with a $17.6 million severance package that incorporated \u201ccompensation for loss of office\u201d and various \u201congoing benefits.\u201d These have not been specified but are believed to include the car and driver that bring her to court each day. She has houses in London and Oxfordshire.         \n\nBut from appearances at least, she is a changed woman. Her clingy, look-at-me clothes have been replaced by functional skirts and blouses; she wears little makeup. She sees a small circle of close friends, no longer goes to the glamorous parties she used to love, and is devoting her time to the legal case and to the baby she had via a surrogate.         \n\n\u201cShe\u2019s doing as well as can be expected, which is not great,\u201d a friend said.         \n\nStill, she is rich. And she is in better shape than Mr. Coulson, 45, who resigned twice over different phases of the phone hacking scandal: once as editor of The News of the World in 2007 and again as director of communications for Mr. Cameron in 2011. Cut loose by the Murdochs, shunned by his old government friends, short of cash and out of work for nearly three years, he has had to sell his expensive London house and move out of town with his wife and three children.         \n\nMr. Coulson appears unchanged physically, and still wears the same nondescript business suits he always did. He commutes to the trial from his new home in Kent or stays overnight in modest hotels or friends\u2019 houses. The Murdochs washed their hands of him long ago, rightly concluding that his employment at Downing Street made the hacking scandal far more combustible by implicating the government and the dominant Conservative Party.         \n\n\u201cMy feeling is that he has paid a much higher price than anyone else,\u201d said Roy Greenslade, a professor of journalism at City University here. \u201cHe didn\u2019t get a massive payoff, he didn\u2019t get Murdoch standing behind him, and he had to fall on his sword twice.\u201d         \n\nA journalist from a competing news organization said, \u201cHe has lost everything, basically.\u201d         \n\nWhile Ms. Brooks\u2019s legal expenses have been paid by her old employer, Mr. Coulson \u2014 whose bills have passed the $400,000 mark and will inevitably climb much higher \u2014 has had a different experience. Despite negotiating an exit package in which the company was obliged to pay his legal bills should he be charged in connection with his work as editor, Mr. Coulson has had to take the company to court to obtain the payments.         \n\nEven though it lost the case, the company is still paying only grudgingly, Mr. Coulson\u2019s friends say.         \n\n\u201cTo this day, they\u2019re making it supremely difficult for him to get his bills paid,\u201d said an acquaintance of Mr. Coulson\u2019s who, like others interviewed for this article, spoke anonymously to comment on a pending case. \u201cThey\u2019re going through his bills with a fine-tooth comb, and the big problem is that they\u2019re delaying payments. He has a big team, and it makes life very difficult.\u201d         \n\nBoth Mr. Coulson and Ms. Brooks are likely to have to pay back at least some of the money to the company if they are found guilty. (Both have pleaded  \n to the hacking charges.)
