{"headline": "Some Retailers Rethink Role in Bangladesh", "body": "\nEver since a building with garment factories collapsed in Bangladesh last week, killing more than 400 people, Western apparel companies with ties to the country have scrambled to address public concerns about working conditions there.         \n\nBenetton repeatedly revised its accounts of goods produced at one of the factories, while officials at  \n, the  \n and other retailers huddled to figure out how to improve conditions, and some debated whether to remain in Bangladesh at all.         \n\nAt least one big American company, however, had already decided to leave the country \u2014 pushed by the last devastating disaster, a fire just six months ago that killed 112 people.         \n\nThe  \n, considered the world\u2019s largest licenser with sales of nearly $40 billion, in March ordered an end to the production of branded merchandise in Bangladesh. A Disney official told The New York Times on Wednesday that the company had sent a letter to thousands of licensees and vendors on March 4 setting out new rules for overseas production.         \n\nLess than 1 percent of the factories used by Disney\u2019s contractors are in Bangladesh, according to the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The company\u2019s efforts had accelerated because of the November fire at a factory that labor advocates asserted had made Disney apparel. The Disney ban also extends to other countries, including Pakistan, where a fire last September killed 262 garment workers.         \n\nDisney\u2019s move reflects the difficult calculus that companies with operations in countries like Bangladesh are facing as they balance profit and reputation against the backdrop of a wrenching human disaster.         \n\nBangladesh has some of the lowest wages in the world, its government is eager to lure Western companies and their jobs, and many labor groups want those big corporations to stay to improve conditions, not cut their losses and run.         \n\nBut as the recent string of disasters has shown, there are great perils to operating there.         \n\n\u201cThese are complicated global issues and there is no \u2018one size fits all\u2019 solution,\u201d said Bob Chapek, president of Disney Consumer Products. \u201cDisney is a publicly held company accountable to its shareholders, and after much thought and discussion we felt this was the most responsible way to manage the challenges associated with our supply chain.\u201d         \n\nThe public disclosure of  \n came two days after officials from two dozen retailers and apparel companies, including  \n, Gap, Carrefour and Li & Fung, met near Frankfurt with representatives from the German government and nongovernment organizations to try to negotiate a plan to ensure safety at the more than 4,000 garment factories in Bangladesh.         \n\nWith 3.6 million garment workers and more than $18 billion in apparel exports last year, Bangladesh is the world\u2019s second-largest apparel exporter after China.         \n\nWalmart, Gap and other companies said on Wednesday that they were already taking action, including paying for Bangladesh factory managers to be trained in fire safety. But labor advocacy groups are pushing them to do more, especially to help finance factory improvements like fire escapes.         \n\n\u201cCompanies feel tremendous pressure now,\u201d said Scott Nova, the executive director of the Worker Rights Consortium, a factory-monitoring group based in Washington. \u201cThe apparel brands and retailers face a greater level of reputation risk of being associated with abusive and dangerous conditions in Bangladesh than ever before.\u201d         \n\nOn Wednesday, thousands of people continued to gather around the collapsed Rana Plaza building in Savar, a suburb of Dhaka, Bangladesh\u2019s capital. As emergency personnel dug through the rubble for yet another day, many relatives of the missing carried signs, holding out diminishing hope that a loved one would be found. A mass burial of unclaimed bodies was conducted as the death count climbed above 400.         \n\nIn Rome, Pope Francis voiced sympathy for Bangladeshi garment workers on Wednesday, saying he was shocked to learn that many of them earned just $40 a month. \u201cThis is called slave labor,\u201d he said.         \n\nEuropean Union officials called for immediate safety improvements, and said they were considering changes in Bangladesh\u2019s duty-free and quota-free status to encourage more responsible management by the country\u2019s garment industry.
