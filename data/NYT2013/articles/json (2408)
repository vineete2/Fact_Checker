{"headline": "Chinese Creating New Auto Niche Within Detroit", "body": "\nDETROIT \u2014 Dozens of companies from  \n are putting down roots in Detroit, part of the country\u2019s steady push into the American auto industry.         \n\nChinese-owned companies are investing in American businesses and new vehicle technology, selling everything from seat belts to shock absorbers in retail stores, and hiring experienced engineers and designers in an effort to soak up the talent and expertise of domestic automakers and their suppliers.         \n\nWhile starting with batteries and auto parts, the spread of Chinese business is expected to result eventually in the sale of Chinese cars in the United States.         \n\n\u201cThe Chinese are well behind the Japanese when they hit our shores 30 years ago,\u201d said David E. Cole, a founder of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. \u201cThey lack the know-how, and they\u2019re coming here to get it.\u201d         \n\nAs businesses sprout up with little fanfare, Chinese companies seem to be trying to avoid the type of public opposition experienced by the Japanese automakers Toyota and Honda in the 1980s, when the sudden influx of foreign cars competing head-on with cars from General Motors, Ford and Chrysler was perceived as a threat to American jobs.         \n\nIn contrast to the Japanese, Chinese auto companies are assiduously avoiding the spotlight. Last year, the biggest carmaker in China, Shanghai Automotive Industries,  \n in suburban Detroit without any publicity, which is almost unheard-of in an industry that thrives on media coverage.         \n\nBut China\u2019s growth in the American auto industry is drawing notice in Washington. Last year, the Obama administration  \n with the World Trade Organization that China\u2019s government was unfairly subsidizing the production of some parts shipped to America. And the country\u2019s inroads into American-made batteries and  \n have drawn scrutiny because that sector of the industry has been heavily subsidized by the United States government.         \n\nThe American industry\u2019s overall resurgence has drawn a growing Chinese population to Detroit, with Chinese-owned suppliers bringing executives from their country and American automakers adding new talent. About 50,000 Chinese, many of them engineers and other professionals who work at General Motors and the Ford Motor Company, live in the metropolitan area.         \n\nBusiness networks are growing too. The  \n boasts a flourishing membership, and counts about 100 Chinese-owned businesses, mostly auto-related, in the region.         \n\nThe Ford Chinese Association, with 650 white-collar workers, predominantly from mainland China, has become one of the largest employee groups at the company. Its president, Raymond Xu, recalled that in 1999, when he came to Detroit to attend college, there were very few Chinese in the area.         \n\n\u201cI think people are going to get more and more comfortable with it,\u201d Mr. Xu said.         \n\nTypical of the Chinese expansion are the nondescript offices of Changan Automotive in an industrial park in the suburban city of Plymouth. Changan, a major carmaker in China, set up a  \n to better understand the structural chassis of a vehicle \u2014 then hired about 20 Detroit engineers, some of whom had been laid off from Detroit\u2019s auto companies, to staff the project.         \n\n\u201cMost of the engineers are very young in China,\u201d said Hong Su, the Changan executive heading the American facility. \u201cThey know how to make vehicles, but they don\u2019t know how to develop them.\u201dOne of his employees is Alan Wall, 54, a former contract engineer at Chrysler who lost his job during the recession.         \n\n\u201cIt was an opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd those tend to come from a company that is trying to expand.\u201d         \n\nLast year, China exported about $13 billion in automotive goods to the United States \u2014 tires, wheels and radios that are sold as replacement parts \u2014 according to AlixPartners, a consulting firm.         \n\nBut many Chinese suppliers are pursuing direct business with the Detroit car companies, which now get many of their most common parts from low-wage nations like Mexico. One supplier,  \n, an industrial giant with about 500,000 employees in the city of Shenyang in northeast China, is still an underdog in Detroit, trying to crack an intricate network of suppliers that have long relationships with G.M. and the other carmakers.         \n\n\u201cWe have been exporting our parts to North America for 15 years for the aftermarket,\u201d said Dongbin Chen, a Brilliance executive, referring to retail sales of replacement parts. \u201cNow our biggest opportunity is with G.M. and the other big companies.\u201d         \n\nBrilliance scored a coup last year by supplying lightweight engine mounts for the new Cadillac ATS sedan made by G.M. in Lansing, Mich., which has whetted the company\u2019s appetite for more.         \n\nAt a United States-China conference held here in November, Brilliance displayed a large exhibit showcasing a range of mundane parts \u2014 including seat belts, steering wheels and shock absorbers \u2014 that it hopes to export to America.         \n\n\u201cWe have the ability and the capacity to supply these kinds of parts,\u201d Mr. Chen said. \u201cAnd I think right now, it is very important for us to be here.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/13/business/global/chinese-automakers-quietly-build-a-detroit-presence.html", "date": "2013-05-12", "description": "Dozens of companies from China are quietly planting roots in Detroit, investing in American businesses and new vehicle technology in what is seen as a first step toward the sale of Chinese cars in the United States."}
