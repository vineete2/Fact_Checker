{"headline": "Inheriting the Family Apron", "body": "\nThere are many routes to a cooking career. Not so long ago, military and prison kitchens were reliable sources of line cooks for American restaurants. Now the siren song of reality television lures many recruits to kitchens and culinary schools.         \n\nBut until recently, very few American chefs were born into the profession. Even the luminaries who led the American food revolution of the 1970s and \u201980s found their own ways to the stove \u2014 through travel, like Alice Waters, or anthropology, like Rick Bayless. Their parents were hardly encouraging.         \n\n\u201cCooking was not considered a respectable or profitable profession,\u201d said Maria Guarnaschelli, an eminent  \n and the mother of Alex Guarnaschelli, who is the chef at  \n, in Greenwich Village. \u201cWe never thought our daughter would be a chef.\u201d         \n\nNow, a generation of chefs and entrepreneurs who grew up in the kitchen are shaping American food.         \n\nThe sons of pioneering American chefs like Norman Van Aken, Bradley Ogden and Larry Forgione have grown into their own chef\u2019s whites. Sara Jenkins, 48, the chef and owner of  \n and  \n in the East Village, trained her palate from childhood by globe-trotting with her mother, the Mediterranean food expert Nancy Harmon Jenkins.         \n\nTwo of the most influential chefs in the Austin, Tex., area are Bryce Gilmore, of  \n, and his father, Jack Gilmore, of  \n. Bryce, 30, grew up learning at Jack\u2019s elbow \u2014 but today Bryce is coaching Jack, who quit a job as a corporate chef after 20 years to get back into the kitchen, in modern culinary arts like curing and cultivating relationships with farmers.         \n\nSecond-generation entrepreneurs like Nicolas Jammet, whose parents, Rita and Andr\u00e9 Jammet, owned New York\u2019s elegant La Caravelle, are using their food knowledge outside the kitchen. Nic, 28, discovered an appetite for sophisticated, sustainable fast food while still in college; the chain he founded in 2007 in Washington, D.C.,  \n, just opened its 20th store in the trendy NoMad hotel in Manhattan.         \n\nAnd some chefs who grew up in less rarefied settings \u2014 like  \n, 31, whose Taiwanese parents ran steak and seafood restaurants around Orlando, Fla. \u2014 are using their own professional kitchens to revisit the true flavors of their childhoods.         \n\nIn all these ways, building on the work of food-world pioneers, the next generation is moving the culinary conversation forward.         \n\nThat is, when their mothers will let them into the kitchen.         \n\nMaria Guarnaschelli published authoritative cookbooks by writers like Julie Sahni and Barbara Tropp when most Americans neither knew nor cared about authentic cooking. But she didn\u2019t teach Alex to cook, because she couldn\u2019t tolerate messes or mistakes in the kitchen.         \n\n\u201cI became a chef in spite of her,\u201d the daughter said, \u201cbut I am a perfectionist because of her, and I couldn\u2019t be a chef without that.\u201d (Last year, Alex, 44, worked up the courage to write her own cookbook, a resolutely lighthearted, messy and nonauthoritative book titled \u201cOld-School Comfort Food.\u201d)         \n\nWhen Dennis Lee, 33, and his brothers, Daniel, 32, and David, 30, started a business selling hot dogs from a stand in Golden Gate Park, their Korean-born mother was not enthusiastic. Even though the hot dogs were organic and garnished with kimchi and gochujang, cooking was the family business that she wanted her sons to escape.         \n\n\u201cWe were supposed to be doctors, not hot dog vendors,\u201d said Dennis, who is now the chef at Namu Gaji in San Francisco, which is owned by all three brothers.         \n\nThe whole family had worked long hours at  \n, the popular pan-Asian restaurant in Natick, Mass., where their mother commanded a regiment of Korean, Japanese and Thai chefs. She insisted that staples like miso and soy sauce be made from scratch. Dennis became the kitchen\u2019s key translator among languages and cuisines. Namu Gaji\u2019s izakaya-style small plates, like napa cabbage, radish and pluots dressed with tangy ponzu and crisp seaweed, reflect how the brothers ate; the organic farm they\u2019ve started reflects how hard they worked.         \n\n\u201cI think that secretly or unconsciously, they were training me to stay in the food business,\u201d Dennis said of his parents. \u201cThey instilled in me this crazy work ethic where I always have to be in the kitchen.\u201d         \n\nMultigenerational restaurants are not a new idea. In Europe, toques are routinely passed down from father to son to grandson \u2014 and in a few recent cases, like Elena Arzak and Anne-Sophie Pic \u2014 from father to daughter. Restaurant dynasties in the United States include the  \n family in Seattle,  \n in New York and the prolific  \n in the Southwest, who have birthed about 80 restaurants: Pappas Bros. Steakhouse, Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen, Pappasito\u2019s Cantina and more. But in those clans, business responsibilities are passed down, not culinary inspiration.         \n\nChefs who grow up in working kitchens have both advantages and disadvantages.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019d call it a gifted curse, or a cursed gift,\u201d said Marc Forgione, 34, whose father, Larry Forgione, was one of the first chefs to put regional American cooking on the fine-dining map, at his Manhattan restaurant  \n, which opened in 1983.         \n\nMarc grew up not in Manhattan but on Long Island; he worked in the kitchen part time for pocket money, but never planned to become a chef. \u201cI didn\u2019t know my father was a celebrity chef,\u201d he said. \u201cThat didn\u2019t even exist at the time. I knew I liked food \u2014 my mother is a great cook \u2014 and I knew my father\u2019s job meant that he worked long hours and wasn\u2019t home a lot. It didn\u2019t seem like a great professional choice.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/11/dining/the-family-apron.html", "date": "2013-09-10", "description": "A new generation of chefs and entrepreneurs who grew up in the kitchen are shaping American food."}
