{"headline": "Police Take On Family Violence to Avert Deaths", "body": "\nAs the number of homicides in New York has reached historically low levels, the Police Department has intensified its efforts to combat a particularly stubborn and daunting source of murders: domestic violence.         \n\nOver the past several years, the department has bolstered the size of the staff at its domestic violence unit by about 40 percent, with 450 police officers now focused on families with histories of violence. The police are now making more domestic violence arrests, while murders linked to domestic violence appear to have declined slightly.         \n\nAs part of their work, the officers assigned to the domestic violence unit make a total of 70,000 precautionary visits a year to the households with past episodes. Each precinct station house also maintains a \u201chigh propensity\u201d list of a dozen or so households that get special attention because they are believed to be most at risk of further violence.         \n\nIn their visits, the police devise safety plans with the victims and check for evidence of further abuse and, when a past abuser is barred from the home, signs of his return. \u201cYou look to see if she has any bruises; you\u2019re looking around the house to see if the furniture is broken,\u201d said Detective Dale Edwards, describing what she does during a home visit. \u201cYou inquire. You try to be tactical about it.\u201d         \n\nThe  \n significantly over the last dozen years, to an average of fewer than one a day in the first six months of 2013 from nearly two a day in 2000. The trend has been attributed in part to the Police Department\u2019s focusing its resources on getting guns off the street and on neighborhood gangs. Now, with the efforts to reduce domestic violence homicides, the department believes it is seeing success in an area once thought to be intractable.         \n\nIn 2011, there were 47 homicides involving \u201cintimate partners\u201d \u2014 a category that includes spouses, boyfriends and girlfriends, current or otherwise. There were 39 such murders last year, and as of Wednesday, 21 this year. (Historically, about 80 percent of the victims of intimate-partner homicides in the city are women.)         \n\n\u201cI think this proactive approach has played a significant role in the reduction of murders,\u201d Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said in an interview.         \n\nThe push in New York mirrors similar efforts around the nation. In Massachusetts, for example, a program in Newburyport won accolades from the White House for its outreach program that tries to identify cases where domestic abusers seem most likely to escalate to murder, and prevent them from doing so.         \n\nIn 2011, the Police Department grew alarmed at a sudden increase in domestic violence murders, prompting an internal review and, ultimately, many changes. Among them, under Mr. Kelly, domestic violence unit assignments became detective-track positions, a significant draw for young and ambitious officers and a signal that the department was making the work a priority.         \n\nMore emphasis has also been placed on evidence collection. After a choking assault, for example, domestic violence officers are required to return to see a victim a day or two later to photograph bruises that may not have been visible when officers first responded.         \n\nIn Sunnyside, Queens, Viridiana Victorio\u2019s address was added to the local precinct house\u2019s watch list after her boyfriend grabbed her neck and slapped her in 2011, one of thousands of misdemeanor domestic assault cases in that borough alone. But something about Ms. Victorio\u2019s case raised a red flag for the police. Officers began visiting her apartment to offer support and to confirm that the boyfriend, Angel P\u00e9rez-Rios, was staying away, as a restraining order required.         \n\nTheir 20th visit was a month ago, on June 25. Something minor \u2014 either the presence of a beer bottle or two glasses, according to the police \u2014 prompted the officers to ask whether Mr. P\u00e9rez-Rios had returned. Ms. Victorio and her children said no.         \n\nBut Mr. P\u00e9rez-Rios had moved back in. The police say he  \n a week later. He is now charged with murder.
