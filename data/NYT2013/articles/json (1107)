{"headline": "After Bangladesh Factory Collapse, Bleak Struggle for Survivors", "body": "\nSAVAR, Bangladesh \u2014 Inside the single room he shares with his wife and young child, Hasan Mahmud Forkan does not sleep easily. Some nights he hears the screams of the garment workers he tried to rescue from the wreckage of the Rana Plaza factory building. Or he dreams the bed itself is collapsing, sucking him down into a bottomless void.         \n\nA few miles away, at a rehabilitation center for the disabled, Rehana Khatun is learning to walk again. She lost both legs in the Rana Plaza collapse and worries that she is not improving because her prosthetic replacements are bulky and uncomfortable. She is only 20 and once hoped to save money so she could return to her village and pay for her own wedding.         \n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t have that dream anymore,\u201d she said, with a cold pragmatism more than self-pity. \u201cHow can I take care of a family?\u201d         \n\nEight months ago, the  \n in the history of the garment industry, and many of the survivors still face an uncertain future. The shoddily constructed building pancaked down onto workers stitching clothes for global brands like Children\u2019s Place, Benetton, Primark and many others. Workers earning as little as $38 a month were crushed under tons of falling concrete and steel. More than 1,100 people died and many others were injured or maimed.         \n\nBut while the Rana Plaza disaster stirred an international outcry \u2014 and shamed many international clothing companies into pledging to help finance safety improvements in other Bangladeshi factories \u2014 the people most directly affected are still living without any guarantees of help or financial compensation.         \n\nFamilies who lost the wages of a son or daughter, husband or wife, are struggling.         \n\nThose who lost limbs, like Ms. Khatun, are uncertain if they will ever walk or hold things again. And many volunteer rescuers like Mr. Forkan and survivors are struggling to deal with debilitating emotional scars.         \n\nToday, Rana Plaza no longer exists. It is a gaping hole in a busy commercial street, mostly cleared of rubble, where rainwater has pooled into a small black lake. But the vacant space still exerts the potency of memory and loss. Banners demanding justice face the street. Sit-ins or small protests are sometimes held. Leftist parties have built a crude statue of a hammer and sickle.         \n\nThere are also people, often hovering near the periphery, clutching official documents, proof of their loss, evidence of their claims for compensation. In a poor country like Bangladesh, a job in a garment factory, despite the low wages, is a financial toehold for many families. A daughter is sent to work to support her parents, or to pay to school her siblings.         \n\nNow it is the parents or siblings who come to the Rana Plaza site, trying to get attention and, they hope, financial assistance.         \n\n\u201cWe are a poor family,\u201d said Monju Ara, 40, whose daughter Smriti, 17, died while working on the third floor of Rana Plaza. \u201cThat is why my daughter had to start work. Her wages helped us educate our younger children. Now we had to stop educating them.\u201d         \n\nMs. Monju Ara stood in a dirt alleyway beside the Rana Plaza site on a recent afternoon, as others soon appeared. One girl, Rahima, 9, was still carrying a \u201cmissing\u201d poster for her brother. Another child, Smriti Mahmuda, 7, had lost her father, and her 15-year-old brother had taken a job in an embroidery factory to support the family. A rickshaw driver with the single name of Alauddin, 43, is now struggling to support his young daughter after his wife died in Rana Plaza.         \n\n\u201cThey always say I will get compensation,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they don\u2019t say when.\u201d         \n\nCompensation remains a complicated and contested issue. Bangladesh\u2019s government has made some modest short-term compensation payments to some victims. Families were given a one-time payment of $257 when they collected the body of a relative in the days after the collapse, and the government has established annuities for survivors who lost limbs \u2014 Ms. Khatun gets about $206 a month in interest, more than most others.
