{"headline": "Second Win Has Giants \u2018Humble\u2019 but Hopeful", "body": "\nPHILADELPHIA \u2014 The unforeseen bliss of a two-game winning streak has not exactly gone to the Giants\u2019 heads. On Sunday, in the waning moments of their second victory in seven days, their sideline was not a party zone. The sting of six losses to start the season remained.         \n\nBut in the Giants\u2019 locker room after a 15-7 victory over the  \n, there were relieved, if sheepish, smiles.         \n\nIt is one thing to finally win a game; it is another to prove that the first victory was not a fluke.         \n\nIn that sense, the Giants (2-6) left Philadelphia feeling accomplished, something they never contemplated in the first month and a half of the season.         \n\nAnd in a testament to the mediocrity of the N.F.C. East, the Giants trail the first-place Dallas Cowboys by just two games. But the Giants remained cautious with their emotions.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re humble,\u201d defensive end Justin Tuck said. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously still a long way to go.\u201d         \n\nStill, a meager dose of optimism emerged, and it came from the lips of the most understated Giant.         \n\n\u201cWe still believe,\u201d quarterback  \n said without elaborating.         \n\nIf Manning feels encouraged, it is because the once-hapless Giants did considerably more things right than wrong on Sunday.         \n\nThe game was an uneven, slapdash affair, and the Giants failed to score a touchdown. But Manning, who did not have a turnover for the second consecutive week, led an offense that was steady and efficient and took control of the game in the first half.         \n\nDefensively, the Giants battered two Eagles quarterbacks and, for the second time this season, held LeSean McCoy, the N.F.L.\u2019s leading rusher, to less than 50 yards on the ground. The Giants\u2019 defense has not given up a point in the last 10 quarters; the Eagles\u2019 touchdown came on a muffed punt late in the game.         \n\n\u201cIt was not always pretty, but this is definitely a huge boost to our confidence,\u201d said Coach Tom Coughlin, whose team heads into a bye week before returning with a home game against the Oakland Raiders on Nov. 10.         \n\nAsked if he was troubled by the irregular nature of the game \u2014 the Giants kicked five field goals \u2014 Coughlin smiled and shook his head.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take a win any way \u2014 2-0, 3-0, 5-3,\u201d he said, well aware that Sunday\u2019s result stopped his team\u2019s eight-game road losing streak.         \n\nThe Eagles (3-5) have lost 10 consecutive games at home.         \n\nThe tone was set early, with the Giants scoring on four of their first five possessions. Emerging from a season-long slumber was wide receiver Hakeem Nicks, who helped set up the Giants\u2019 first score, a 40-yard Josh Brown field goal.         \n\nNicks\u2019s first catch, for 22 yards, was the kind of play he had not been making for most of this season \u2014 a difficult, back-shoulder reception as he wrested the ball from a defender.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a rough start for us,\u201d said Nicks, who finished with seven catches. \u201cBut I feel like we\u2019re shaking it off now.\u201d         \n\nWhile Nicks was rediscovering his rapport with Manning, other Giants receivers were also catching passes. On the next Giants possession, which led to a 44-yard Brown field goal, the key play was a 27-yard pass to tight end Brandon Myers.         \n\nVictor Cruz was a frequent target as well, catching seven passes, including one spectacular throw that showed that Manning, struggling through an atypical season, had not lost his touch.         \n\nRunning to his left, Manning stopped and threw across the width of the field to his right, lofting the ball about 50 yards. The pass looped over a defender, dropping into the outstretched arms of Cruz a few feet from the right sideline. It was a pass that was almost impossible to defend and led to the third Brown field goal.         \n\nManning finished with 25 completions in 39 attempts for 246 yards.         \n\nAlso getting into the act was the new running back Peyton Hillis, who ran for 70 yards on 20 carries and caught five passes out of the backfield. Hillis, for the second successive week, gave the Giants a ground-game threat, finally providing credibility to their play-action fakes. If Manning can freeze linebackers with play-action, the downfield passing attack will continue to come alive.
