{"headline": "Boehner Says Losses in Election Won\u2019t Affect Budget Stance", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Speaker  \n said Thursday that election losses last November would not deter his party from pressing its vision of reducing the size of government and turning government health care programs largely over to the private sector \u2014 with no more tax increases.         \n\nIn an interview, Mr. Boehner said that candidates and personalities \u2014 not Republican proposals on  \n and spending cuts \u2014 accounted for the party\u2019s defeats, taking a hard line on further budget talks even as Senate Republicans met with  \n in a search for common ground.         \n\n\u201cThere are a lot of things that decide an election, especially the two candidates that you have, the personalities that they have, positions they have taken,\u201d he said.         \n\n\u201cThere are a lot of factors that went into that election,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t know that that\u2019s the issue. Eighty percent of the American people think that Washington has a spending problem.\u201d         \n\nThe speaker\u2019s tough stance on differences with the president came as Mr. Obama pursued his outreach to Congressional Republicans, this time in the Senate. For almost an hour and a half, the president and Senate Republicans jousted cordially on entitlement spending, the  \n pipeline, the White House\u2019s role on  \n proposals and whether an overhaul of the tax code should generate more revenues through higher taxes or only economic growth.         \n\nNeither side offered concrete movement toward the other, but the president and Senate Republicans agreed they had a narrow window \u2014 perhaps through July \u2014 to reach an accord, and both sides agreed to try.         \n\n\u201cI specifically said, to get to a big deal you have to work with us. You have to grind it out with us until we get there. You can\u2019t break off and say, \u2018Oh, Congress has to do it,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Senator John Hoeven, Republican of North Dakota, who added that Republicans and the president agreed the window would most likely close by July. That is when Republicans could pick a fight over the  \n and when Mr. Obama said the politics of the midterm elections would begin to take hold.         \n\nRepresentative  \n of California, the House Democratic leader, also struck a conciliatory note in an interview, saying she was open to examining a change in the way the government calculates inflation to slow the growth of  \n and other benefit programs, while slowly boosting tax revenues.         \n\nThat tone contrasted sharply with the direction House Republicans are taking. Although Mr. Boehner expressed some hope that the divided Congress could reach a deficit accord, he gave little indication that Mr. Obama\u2019s overtures to House Republicans had yielded tangible movement.         \n\nMr. Boehner also put the failure of his private budget talks with the president squarely on the White House\u2019s shoulders, saying that avenue toward agreement was now closed.         \n\n\u201cI gave the president my bottom line, and he didn\u2019t budge off it,\u201d Mr. Boehner said. \u201cWe offered to continue to have the talks. It was the White House who said, \u2018Well, there isn\u2019t really any reason to.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nThe House budget, which will come for a vote in the next week, seeks to bring taxes and spending into balance within 10 years, largely by rolling back key measures from the president\u2019s first term. It would repeal his health insurance exchanges and expansion of  \n, but retain cuts to Medicare that the Republican presidential ticket, Mitt Romney and Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, spent months denouncing.         \n\nIt would maintain the level of taxation secured by increases on the wealthy in the January deal to resolve the so-called fiscal cliff. But it also says the top tax rate should fall to 25 percent from 39.6 percent, with the cost offset by eliminating undisclosed tax deductions, credits and loopholes. And it assumes the repeal of Mr. Obama\u2019s Wall Street regulatory bill. Medicaid, food stamps and other programs for the poor would be cut significantly, part of $4.6 trillion in cuts through 2023.         \n\n\u201cThe budget is an opportunity to lay out your priorities, what your party believes in, and that\u2019s exactly what our budget does,\u201d Mr. Boehner said.         \n\nIt was not clear, however, how those priorities are to be meshed with a Senate Democratic budget that would expand spending on infrastructure, raise taxes and still end up with a budget deficit of $566 billion at the end of the 10-year window.         \n\n\u201cHis budget was roundly defeated last November,\u201d Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, said of the Republican plan, drafted by Mr. Ryan. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine why they don\u2019t get a new dance step here.\u201d         \n\nMs. Pelosi did suggest that there was some Democratic latitude on the biggest issue for Republicans: changes to entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare. She repeated her resolute opposition to raising the Medicare eligibility age. But she said she would look at changing the way the government calculates inflation, while raising tax revenue over time. \u201cI want a debate in our caucus,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are views, some of them on the progressive side of the spectrum, who think that this can be done without hurting the poor or the very elderly.\u201d         \n\nMr. Obama assured Senate Republicans that a decision on the Keystone pipeline would come \u201cwithin months, not years,\u201d senators said, offering criticism that environmentalists had overstated its potential impact. They discussed at length whether a tax code overhaul would provide the economic boost the president needs to jump-start tax receipts \u2014 with overall tax increases.         \n\nThe president offered lavish praise for his 2008 rival, Senator John McCain from Arizona, on the 40th anniversary of Mr. McCain\u2019s release from a Vietnamese prisoner of war camp, a moment that drew warm applause.         \n\nMr. Obama told the gathering that they received him more warmly than their House counterparts did. \u201cHe mentioned \u2014 well, joked \u2014 about it being a more genteel environment,\u201d said Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona.         \n\nBut Democratic olive branches are going to require a reciprocal gesture from the Republicans, the president told them, and Mr. Boehner made no such offer.         \n\nIn a meeting later with House Democrats, Mr. Obama acknowledged the realities of a divided government, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re obviously going to have to talk about some things that we don\u2019t particularly like,\u201d according to Representative Peter Welch of Vermont. \u201cIt was a dose of reality,\u201d Mr. Welch said, adding that he reassured them, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to chase a bad deal.\u201d         \n\nMr. Boehner said Republicans had already allowed $650 billion in new taxes and would not agree to more. Nonetheless, he expressed guarded optimism that the House and Senate could eventually come together. \u201cMaybe something comes out of it,\u201d he said. \u201cHope springs eternal.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/15/us/politics/boehner-says-election-losses-wont-deter-push-for-smaller-government.html", "date": "2013-03-14", "description": "Speaker John A.
