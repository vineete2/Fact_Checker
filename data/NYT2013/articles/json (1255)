{"headline": "Pope Ushers In Lent, Making Its Message of Sacrifice Personal This Year", "body": "\nVATICAN CITY \u2014  \n presided over Ash Wednesday services, his final public Mass, at St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, thanking the faithful for their support during his nearly eight-year pontificate, which will end on Feb. 28 when he becomes  \n         \n\nThe basilica was packed for the occasion as the pope, dressed in the traditional purple robes worn at Lent, the 40-day period of fasting and prayer preceding Easter, celebrated a Solemn Mass attended by a number of the cardinals who will be called on to choose his successor in just over a month.         \n\nAmong them was Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone,  \n, who at the end of the service addressed the pope\u2019s unexpected decision to step down. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be sincere, your holiness, if we didn\u2019t tell you that this evening there is a veil of sadness in our hearts,\u201d Cardinal Bertone said, his voice breaking.         \n\nHe praised the pope\u2019s \u201cstrong faith\u201d and \u201cgreat courage\u201d that led him to make a decision that was guided by Benedict\u2019s \u201cdeep love\u201d for God and the church.         \n\nThe congregants burst into a deafening standing ovation that lasted for minutes and continued as Benedict left the basilica, \n at the people lining the nave of the cavernous Baroque church. Some wiped away tears.         \n\nIn his homily, Benedict called for the end of rivalries in the church. Christians are called to bear witness to faith, to reveal the \u201cface of the church,\u201d which is at times \u201cdisfigured,\u201d he said.         \n\n\u201cI am thinking in particular of the sins against the unity of the church, of the divisions in the body of the church,\u201d he said. \u201cOvercoming individualism and rivalry is a humble and precious sign for those who have distanced themselves from the faith or who are indifferent.\u201d         \n\nEarlier, an equally enthusiastic crowd greeted Benedict at his weekly audience at the Vatican. It was his first public appearance since the announcement of his resignation two days before, and one of the dwindling opportunities for his followers to see and hear him before he withdraws into a far more sheltered life in a convent within the Vatican, where an apartment is being prepared for him.         \n\nThe pope told the faithful that he had made his decision \u201cin full freedom for the good of the church\u201d because he no longer had the strength needed to carry out the duties of the papacy, and he reassured them that his choice would not damage the church.         \n\n\u201cI am strengthened and reassured by the certainty that the church is Christ\u2019s, who will never leave her without his guidance and care,\u201d the pope said. \u201cI thank all of you for the love and for the prayers with which you have accompanied me. Thank you. In these days which have not been easy for me, I have felt almost physically the power of prayer \u2014 your prayers \u2014 which the love of the church has given me. Continue to pray for me, for the church and for the future pope. The Lord will guide us.\u201d         \n\nA huge banner at the rear of the Vatican\u2019s Paul VI audience hall, which can hold around 8,000 people, proclaimed \u201cThanks Your Holiness.\u201d         \n\nFrancesca Meggiorini of Verona, Italy, one of the many Catholics who gathered for a last glimpse of the pope, said she had brought her four children because \u201cthis is special.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI wanted my kids to be present,\u201d she added. \u201cThe pope was a man whose simple words went straight to the heart. So it\u2019s wonderful for my children to be here. I think this experience will remain in their memory.\u201d         \n\nKevin Murphy, on a pilgrimage from the St. Benedict Catholic School in Bury St. Edmunds, in England, called Benedict \u201ca great moral and spiritual leader.\u201d         \n\nAt a news conference on Wednesday, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, the Vatican spokesman, said that the conclave to choose the next pope would begin 15 to 20 days after the pope resigns, and a new leader of the church is expected to be in place by Easter, on March 31.         \n\nAs that process plays out, Benedict himself will spend his final day as pope bidding farewell to cardinals in the morning. Then he plans to fly by helicopter in the afternoon to the papal summer residence at  \n, in the hills outside Rome, where he will be when his resignation takes effect at 8 p.m. local time.         \n\nThe pope will then move into the convent, where his presence should be of comfort to his successor, Father Lombardi said.         \n\n\u201cIt is a wise solution for Benedict to stay in Vatican City, where he can pray, study and have personal contacts,\u201d he said. \u201cThe successor and the cardinals will be happy to have very nearby someone who knows well what the spiritual needs of the church are.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/world/europe/pope-benedict-xvi-ash-wednesday-mass.html", "date": "2013-02-13", "description": "In his first public appearance since the announcement of his resignation, Pope Benedict XVI said he no longer had the strength needed to carry out the duties of the papacy."}
