{"headline": "Rivera Hoping This Send-Off Isn\u2019t a Farewell ", "body": "\nBOSTON \u2014  \n has grown used to ceremonies in his farewell season. He got a surfboard in Oakland, a bicycle in San Diego, a gold record in Cleveland. The Dodgers gave him a fishing pole, the Rangers a cowboy hat and boots, the Twins a rocking chair made of broken bats. Rivera has collected several oversized checks for his foundation.         \n\nOn Sunday at Fenway Park, the Red Sox gave Rivera a chance to relive an epic failure, with a pitch-by-pitch scoreboard replay of their rally off him in Game 4 of the 2004 American League Championship Series. Kevin Millar, Dave Roberts and Bill Mueller provided commentary.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not strange, it\u2019s a good thing,\u201d said Rivera, ever the gentleman, after the game. \u201cThey have all the power to do that. They beat us that year. Why not? You have a great time, you have fun \u2014 they did. All the power to them.\u201d         \n\nIt was not exactly sporting of the  \n, taking yet another bow at Rivera\u2019s expense, but there was more humiliation to come. After razzing Rivera before the game, the Red Sox torched the  \n\u2019 pitching staff all night long, completing an emphatic sweep with a 9-2 victory. In seven games against the Red Sox over the last two weekends, the Yankees are 1-6 with an 8.56 earned run average.         \n\nThey remain just three games out in the wild-card race, despite suffering a new injury and introducing a new player pretty much every day. For the record, Sunday\u2019s newcomer was a reliever, Mike Zagurski, who allowed two runs in a third of an inning. The injury was a calf strain for Alex Rodriguez.         \n\nIn any case, there was no need for Rivera, who signed autographs for fans along the bullpen railing after the final out. During the game, he scrawled a message on the bullpen wall. He would not say what he wrote, but added: \u201cI was giving thanks. That\u2019s it.\u201d         \n\nRivera was not willing to concede that this would be his final game as an active player on Yawkey Way. As it stands now, the winner of the wild-card game would meet the Red Sox in a division series.         \n\n\u201cHopefully it\u2019s not the last time,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a blessing to be here and play here for so many years. It\u2019s wonderful.\u201d         \n\nRivera earned a save here in the 1999 A.L.C.S., and two more in the 2003 rematch while winning the Most Valuable Player award. But he became part of Red Sox lore the next fall when he blew the save in Game 4 while trying to close out a sweep. That propelled the Red Sox to eight consecutive victories and their first title in 86 years.         \n\nRivera also blew the save in Game 5 of the 2004 A.L.C.S., and blew two more opportunities in the opening series of the 2005 regular season at Yankee Stadium.         \n\nWith all that in mind, the fans here gave Rivera a standing ovation at the 2005 Fenway opener the next week, during pregame introductions on the day the Red Sox received their championship rings. Rivera smiled and waved, an enduring symbol of grace in defeat.         \n\n\u201cWell, I mean, it was great,\u201d Rivera said Sunday, reminded of the moment. \u201cHey, they won. We don\u2019t give it to them; I don\u2019t give it to them. They won. Therefore, they deserve credit. It\u2019s simple like that.\u201d         \n\nDespite his low moments here, including a blown save and loss on July 24, 2004, when Mueller homered off him for a stirring victory, Rivera has a better earned run average here than he did at the old Yankee Stadium. In 55 regular-season games at Fenway, Rivera had a 2.54 E.R.A. (it was 2.61 at the old Yankee Stadium), with 36 saves in 44 chances.         \n\n\u201cWhen you come here to play against the Red Sox in Fenway, it\u2019s just always great games,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cIt\u2019s not such an easy game. Big moments, every game means something. The games are spectacular.\u201d         \n\nAt the start of Sunday\u2019s ceremony, a quartet of cellists in white tuxedos performed \u201cEnter Sandman\u201d behind home plate. The rendition fell a bit flat \u2014 it turns out that heavy metal does not translate well to the cello \u2014 but the Red Sox soon played to their audience.         \n\nWith the full Boston team arrayed on the field behind the mound, the scoreboard showed a video lasting several minutes, including each of the four balls Rivera threw Millar, plus Roberts\u2019s stolen base and Mueller\u2019s game-tying single. Rivera watched it all from the railing of the visitors\u2019 dugout, and then watched some more as the scoreboard showed the clip from the 2005 home opener.         \n\nTo be fair, the gifts that followed were thoughtful and appropriate. David Ortiz presented a painting of Rivera acknowledging the fans in 2005. Dustin Pedroia gave Rivera a square from the Green Monster scoreboard with the No. 42, signed by the team.         \n\nJon Lester unveiled a Fenway seat bearing No. 42 on one of its wood slats, and Koji Uehara gave Rivera the pitchers\u2019 rubber from the bullpen. The Red Sox owners gave Rivera a check for his foundation, and a team employee gave him a framed poem.         \n\nRivera smiled through it all, and shook hands or hugged all the Red Sox on the field. Later, he said he appreciated everything but did not deserve so much praise. John Farrell, the Red Sox manager, disagreed.         \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a role model, and I mean that in the greatest sense I can say it,\u201d Farrell said. \u201cEveryone should look up to him, the way he lives his life.\u201d         \n\nLife as an active player is down to its final two weeks for Rivera, unless his battered team recovers from a humbling weekend.
