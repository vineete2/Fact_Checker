{"headline": "With U.S. Set to Leave Afghanistan, Echoes of 1989", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The young president who ascended to office as a change agent decides to end the costly and unpopular war in Afghanistan. He seeks an exit with honor by pledging long-term financial support to allies in Kabul, while urging reconciliation with the insurgency. But some senior advisers lobby for a deliberately slow withdrawal, and propose leaving thousands of troops behind to train and support Afghan security forces.         \n\nThis is a nearly exact description of the endgame conundrum facing President Obama as he prepares for a critical visit by Hamid Karzai, the Afghan president, planned for early January.         \n\nBut the account is actually drawn from declassified Soviet archives describing  \n\u2019s closed-door struggles with his Politburo and army chiefs to end the Kremlin\u2019s intervention in Afghanistan \u2014 one that began with a commando raid, coup and modest goals during Christmas week of 1979 but became, after a decade, what Mr. Gorbachev derided as \u201ca bleeding wound.\u201d         \n\nWhat mostly is remembered about the withdrawal is the Soviet Union\u2019s humiliation, and the ensuing factional bloodletting across Afghanistan that threw the country into a vicious civil war. It ended with Taliban control and the establishment of a safe haven for Al Qaeda before the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.         \n\nBut scholars who have studied the Soviet archives point out another lesson for the Obama administration as it manages the pullout of American and allied combat forces from Afghanistan by the end of 2014.         \n\n\u201cThe main thing the Soviets did right was that they continued large-scale military assistance to the regime they left behind after the final withdrawal in \u201989,\u201d said  \n, a professor at George Mason University and author of \u201cLeaving Without Losing: The War on Terror After Iraq and Afghanistan\u201d (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2012).         \n\n\u201cAs long as the Afghan regime received the money and the weapons, they did pretty well \u2014 and held on to power for three years,\u201d Mr. Katz said. The combat effectiveness of Kabul\u2019s security forces increased after the Soviet withdrawal, when the fight for survival become wholly their own.         \n\nBut then the Soviet Union dissolved in December 1991, and the new Russian leader, Boris N. Yeltsin, heeded urgings of the United States and other Western powers to halt aid to the Communist leadership in Afghanistan, not just arms and money, but also food and fuel. The Kremlin-backed government in Kabul fell three months later.         \n\nTo be sure, there are significant contrasts between the two interventions in Afghanistan. The Soviet invasion and occupation were condemned as illegal aggression, while the American one was embraced by the international community, including  \n, as a \u201cjust war,\u201d one with limited goals of routing the Taliban and eliminating Al Qaeda. That war of necessity has since evolved into a war of choice, one the Obama administration is working to end as quickly as is feasible.         \n\nDespite the differences going in, both the Soviet Union and the United States soon learned that Afghanistan is a land where foreigners aspiring to create nations in their image must combat not just the Taliban but tribalism, orthodoxy, corruption and a medieval view of women. As well, Pakistan has had interests at odds with those of the neighboring government in Afghanistan, whether Kabul was an ally of Moscow or of Washington.         \n\n\u201cThe Soviet Union did not understand religious and ethnic factors sufficiently, and overestimated the capacity of Afghan society to move very fast toward a modern era, in this case socialism,\u201d said Svetlana Savranskaya, director of Russian programs at the National Security Archive, an independent research center at George Washington University.         \n\n\u201cHere I see similarities with the approach of the United States, especially with all the discussion about trying to leave behind an Afghanistan that is democratic and respects the rights of women, ideas that simply are not accepted across the broad society there,\u201d said Ms. Savranskaya, who has written extensively on the Soviet archives.         \n\nIf the Soviet experience offers any guidance to the current American withdrawal, she said, it would be to accelerate the departure of foreign combat forces \u2014 but to leave in their place a \u201csustained, multiyear international involvement in military training, education and civilian infrastructure projects, and maybe not focusing on building democracy as much as improving the lives of the common people.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/world/asia/us-war-in-afghanistan-has-echoes-of-soviet-experience.html", "date": "2013-01-01", "description": "As the United States prepares to withdraw from an unpopular war in Afghanistan, it faces challenges similar to what the country\u2019s last occupier, the Soviet Union, had experienced."}
