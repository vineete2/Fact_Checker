{"headline": "Desegregation and the Public Schools", "body": "\nIn many northern cities, the 1974 United States Supreme Court decision  \n killed any hopes of integrating the public schools. That ruling, involving Detroit and its suburbs, said that a mandatory plan to achieve integration by busing black children from Detroit across district lines to mainly white suburbs was unconstitutional. The result accelerated white flight to the suburbs, leaving the schools in urban centers even more segregated than they had been.         \n\nMost famously, this happened in Boston, where court-ordered integration resulted in a busing plan that wound up mainly moving children of color around the city.         \n\nBut busing had greater success in some places, particularly those where the plans were carried out countywide, reducing the chances of white flight. They included Louisville-Jefferson County, Raleigh-Wake County and Charlotte-Mecklenburg County.         \n\nThis week\u2019s Retro Report video, \u201cThe Battle for Busing,\u201d follows the story of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg district, which became a national model for racial integration for 30 years only to resegregate about a decade ago, after a court ruling lifted the mandatory integration plan.         \n\nWhen the Charlotte busing plan began in 1971, there were whites who threatened to go to jail before they would let their children attend schools with blacks. The open racism voiced by whites in the Retro Report\u2019s archival footage is vicious and ugly; students were injured when fistfights broke out between whites and blacks.         \n\nBut by 1974, the district was being singled out in the news media as a national model, particularly West Charlotte High, which had previously been all black. The impact of integration was visible almost immediately at the school. When whites arrived, the facilities were upgraded, said a former chairman of the school board, Arthur Griffin. A gravel parking lot was paved, and the football stadium and the gymnasium were renovated.         \n\nOver the years, researchers like Prof. Roslyn Mickelson at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte, conducted studies concluding that children of any race who attended diverse schools were more likely to succeed, in areas like graduating, avoiding crime and attending college.         \n\nBut in the end, the same federal courts that had ushered in integration helped kill it. In the late 1990s,  \n essentially said that the Charlotte district had met its constitutional duty by successfully creating a single school system serving all children regardless of race and that no more need be done.         \n\nIn a few years\u2019 time, West Charlotte High, which had been roughly 40 percent black and 60 percent white in the 1970s, became 88 percent black and 1 percent white. And it wasn\u2019t just Charlotte. Today, nearly two-thirds of the school districts that had been ordered to desegregate are no longer required to do so, including Seminole County, Fla. (2006); Little Rock, Ark. (2007); and Galveston County, Tex. (2009).         \n\nThe New York City system is more segregated than it was in the 1980s: half the schools are more than 90 percent black and Hispanic.

It is a nonprofit video news organization that aims to provide a thoughtful counterweight to today\u2019s 24/7 news cycle. The videos are typically 10 to 12 minutes long.         \n\nYou can find more information about coming episodes and how to  \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/09/booming/desegregation-and-the-public-schools.html", "date": "2013-09-09", "description": "Retro Report: Three decades after court-ordered busing began in Charlotte and other cities, many plans have come undone and integration has diminished."}
