{"headline": "Born as a Tribute but Faltering, a Bronx School Nears Its End", "body": "\nThe  \n, a son of the Time Warner chairman, by one of his former high school students in 1997 transfixed a city that was breaking free of its crime-ridden past.         \n\nFive years later, the New York City  \n opened Jonathan Levin High School for Media and Communications in the same South Bronx building where he had taught, declaring it \u201ca living tribute\u201d to the English teacher\u2019s \u201cspirit, values, commitment and impassioned belief\u201d that every child has a right to a quality education.         \n\nBut in the past few years, a quality education at Levin High School became harder to come by. Money for a college scholarship in Mr. Levin\u2019s name dried up. A ball field that a Mets official helped pay for fell into disrepair. Computers sat untouched, applications to the school fell and the graduation rate sank to 31 percent, the fifth-lowest in the city.         \n\nNow, just a decade after it opened, New York has deemed Levin High School a failure, and is preparing to close it down.         \n\nClosing schools, and replacing them with new ones, has become a hallmark of education reform efforts around the country, promoted by the Obama administration and embraced by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who has shuttered 142 of them since taking office in 2002 and, in his final year, is moving to close 24 more. The central, free-market premise is that schools that fail to deliver should not be permitted to continue, and that their buildings could be better used to experiment with new ideas, often with new personnel.         \n\nThe policy has been repeatedly criticized by teachers\u2019 unions, and is now also under attack by several Democratic candidates for mayor, who in varying degrees have all pledged to slow or halt the process of closing schools. Civil-rights groups have filed complaints with the federal Education Department asserting that the policy has a disproportionate effect on black and Hispanic students.         \n\nThe critics contend that school systems like New York\u2019s are more interested in letting schools fail, to accelerate the process of creating new schools, than in helping struggling schools, and the students in them, succeed.         \n\n\u201cWe have a mayor who treats the act of closing a school as the accomplishment,\u201d said  \n, the city\u2019s public advocate and, as one of five Democratic mayoral hopefuls, a supporter of a moratorium on closings. \u201cWhat should be a last resort is now the go-to policy, and kids are suffering the consequences.\u201d         \n\nThere may be no better example for weighing these arguments than Levin High School, which, as it happens, is one of seven small schools operating inside the shell of William Howard Taft High School, Jonathan Levin\u2019s school, which was closed for poor performance.         \n\n\u201cIt is actually very painful,\u201d said Mr. Levin\u2019s father,  \n, 73, who retired from Time Warner in 2001. The schools chancellor personally called Mr. Levin in January to prepare him for the heartbreak. \u201cI said that: \u2018Well, there are some special things taking place at that school and those statistics may belie the efforts that encourage a couple of students to go on. We could have future leaders and future writers somewhere in that group.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nIt was always the school\u2019s mission to tackle the needs of poor students, the very population Jonathan Levin steered his career toward. Then, as now, poverty and danger were elements of any child\u2019s day. In recent years, metal detectors were placed at the main entrance and security guards hovered throughout the ground floor hallways. In a school survey last year, half of all students said they did not always feel safe in the halls, restrooms and locker rooms.         \n\nThe killing of Mr. Levin (pronounced luh-VIN) on May 30, 1997, sent his students and colleagues into waves of grief. His body was discovered, bound with duct tape, in his apartment on the Upper West Side. The police said he had been tortured with a knife for his bank card number and shot in the back of his head. At his funeral, some of his students propped a cardboard sign atop his plain wooden coffin with the words: \u201cWe are his kids.\u201d         \n\nA former student,  \n, was convicted of second-degree murder, and is serving 25 years to life.
