{"headline": "After Mandela, a Test at the Polls for His Party", "body": "\nDIEPSLOOT, South Africa \u2014 Isaac Makhura gestured toward the squalid sprawl of shacks outside his house in this informal settlement, where some of the country\u2019s most desperate people live. Was it any wonder, he said, that he no longer had any qualms about voting against the African National Congress, the party of his entire family for three generations?         \n\n\u201cIs this why Nelson Mandela fought for our freedom?\u201d he asked as South Africans mourned  \n of Mr. Mandela, the country\u2019s first black president and the party\u2019s most beloved leader. \u201cThe A.N.C. has let us down.\u201d         \n\nIn the coming months, the African National Congress will face what may be its most fiercely competitive election since it came to power in 1994 \u2014 and, for the first time, will do so without its most important moral figure, Mr. Mandela.         \n\n\u201cAfter Mandela, the A.N.C. loses the biggest link to its glorious past,\u201d said William Gumede, who has written extensively about Mr. Mandela and his party. \u201cIt will face the voters without him.\u201d         \n\nCorruption allegations against senior officials like President Jacob Zuma, a failing school system, endemic joblessness, violent crime and growing inequality have whittled away the once near-universal support for the party in places like Diepsloot, a traditional bedrock of a party that boasts of its \u201cbias toward the working class.\u201d         \n\nNow Diepsloot is a political battleground, with other parties making inroads. No one expects the African National Congress to lose the national election, but there are signs that it could slip below 60 percent of the vote, an important psychological figure for a party accustomed to landslides.         \n\nMr. Mandela leaves behind a South Africa where political power is firmly in the hands of the majority, and he helped steer the country away from what seemed to be the biggest risk at the time of its transition to democracy: a race war that pitted blacks against whites.         \n\nBut economic power is still largely in white hands. Unemployment, particularly among the young black people who make up a vast population bulge here, is higher than ever. Inequality has grown, as a small group of black elites has joined wealthy whites in the upper echelons of society, leaving the masses far behind.  \n over this state of affairs, after bubbling for years,  \n when the police killed 34 striking miners in the country\u2019s worst police violence since the end of apartheid.         \n\nIt was a far cry from the heady days of Mr. Mandela\u2019s release from prison after 27 years in 1990 and his landslide victory in South Africa\u2019s first nonracial election four years later.         \n\n\u201cLet there be justice for all,\u201d Mr. Mandela said in his inaugural address. \u201cLet there be peace for all. Let there be work, bread, water and salt for all.\u201d         \n\nIt turned out these promises would be tough to keep, even for a man with Mr. Mandela\u2019s gifts.         \n\n\u201cThere was so much hope,\u201d George Bizos, Mr. Mandela\u2019s lawyer and a close friend, said before Mr. Mandela died. \u201cThose of us who took part in the struggle, we expected the speedy establishment of an egalitarian society. It has turned out to be a daydream.\u201d         \n\nMr. Mandela pledged in 1997 that South Africa would avoid the \u201cformation of predatory elites that thrive on the basis of looting national wealth and the entrenchment of corruption.\u201d         \n\nAnd yet that has happened. The African National Congress has slowly gone from a liberation movement to a Tammany Hall-style political machine. Corruption is endemic. Deep ties between big business and politicians have reinforced the perception that those in power seek only their own enrichment.         \n\nMr. Mandela\u2019s death now poses daunting questions for the party. Even in his decline, it benefited from the aura of promise and possibility that surrounded him, and the  \n was evident. In recent months, it bused masses of supporters in African National Congress T-shirts to the hospital where he was being treated. After his death, party supporters were quick to tie the party to Mr. Mandela and its current leaders.         \n\nIn Soweto on Friday, the day after Mr. Mandela died, South African flags were few, but the emblem of the African National Congress \u2014 a hand clutching a spear on a field of black, green and yellow \u2014 was ubiquitous. \u201cThis Mandela belongs to the A.N.C.,\u201d a man said through a microphone.         \n\nA large truck was parked at a corner, a rolling stage with giant color photographs of the current president, Mr. Zuma, proclaiming that the entire province is now a better place.         \n\n\u201cViva Mandela,\u201d a man shouted into the microphone. \u201cViva A.N.C., viva Zuma!\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/10/world/africa/after-mandela-a-test-at-the-polls-for-his-party.html", "date": "2013-12-09", "description": "After the death of its most beloved leader, the African National Congress could face its most competitive elections since it came to power in 1994."}
