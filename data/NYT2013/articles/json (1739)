{"headline": "Mental Health Again an Issue in Gun Debate", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Despite deep divisions that have kept Congress from passing new gun safety laws for almost two decades, there is one aspect of gun control on which many Democrats, Republicans and even the National Rifle Association agree: the need to give mental health providers better resources to treat dangerous people and prevent them from buying weapons.         \n\nYet efforts to improve the country\u2019s fraying mental health system to help prevent mass shootings have stalled on Capitol Hill, tied up in the broader fight over expanded background checks and limits on weapons sales.         \n\nNow the shooting at the Washington Navy Yard by a man who authorities say showed telltale signs of  \n is spurring a push to move ahead with bipartisan mental health policy changes. The new debate over gun control is beginning to turn not on weapons or ammunition, but on the question of whether to spend more money on treating and preventing mental illness.         \n\nProponents again face a steep uphill push, but they see an opening even if it remains unclear whether any changes under consideration could have headed off the latest attack, in which the authorities say Aaron Alexis, a former Navy reservist, bought the shotgun he used in Virginia.         \n\n\u201cGiven the clear connection between recent mass shootings and mental illness, the Senate should not delay bipartisan legislation that would help address this issue,\u201d Senators Kelly Ayotte, Republican of New Hampshire, and Mark Begich, Democrat of Alaska, wrote Wednesday in a joint statement to the Senate leadership. The legislation they are pushing, which was held up when a more sweeping gun measure was defeated earlier this year, would establish programs to train teachers to recognize the signs of mental illness and how to defuse potentially violent situations.         \n\nSenator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader and a strong proponent of the failed Senate plan to expand the federal background check system, is resisting any move to advance the mental health provisions, fearing that it would be used as a fig leaf by those who oppose expanded checks while closing the door to weapons restrictions in the future. Both Ms. Ayotte and Mr. Begich opposed the gun control bill that failed in April.         \n\nSome gun rights advocates fear the opposite: that opening discussion on mental health could be a back door to a flood of new federal gun laws.         \n\nBut several senators, like Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, who has pushed for tougher gun laws since last year\u2019s elementary school massacre in Newtown, Conn., see mental health policy as a way forward.         \n\n\u201c \n is really the key to unlocking this issue,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal said. \u201cI\u2019ve become more and more convinced that we should establish the mental health issue as our common ground.\u201d         \n\nBut while state lawmakers have taken steps in recent years to make buying weapons harder for certain people showing signs of mental illness in places including New York, Connecticut and Florida, where the legislation won the blessing of the National Rifle Association, there is not yet serious discussion in Congress of doing so.         \n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re having auditory  \n, that\u2019s a sign of  \n,\u201d said Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, referring to reports that Mr. Alexis suffered from delusions. Though someone like that should not have a gun, Mr. Coburn said, he expressed little faith that Congress could come together to write a law to fix that.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all politics,\u201d he said. The senator helped lead negotiations on a background check proposal that fell apart earlier this year.         \n\nMr. Alexis appears to be only the latest gunman whose mental health issues did not reach the level at which he would have been prohibited from buying a firearm under federal law. And it is unknowable whether even the most drastic improvements to the nation\u2019s mental health system would have caught and treated the symptoms of someone like Mr. Alexis. The same can also be said for laws that restrict gun ownership for people with histories of mental illness.         \n\nThe Veterans Affairs Department said Wednesday that on the two times Mr. Alexis visited an emergency room in August, he seemed alert and denied being depressed or thinking of harming himself.
