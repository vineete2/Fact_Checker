{"headline": "A New Delhi-Born Restaurateur Brings Power Dining to D.C.", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In December 1988, when Ashok Bajaj opened the  \n here, the city was gearing up for the inauguration of President George H. W. Bush. For Washington, that\u2019s pretty much where the celebrating ended.         \n\nThat year the District of Columbia had surpassed Detroit as the country\u2019s murder capital, with a record 372 killings. The city was not, to put it mildly, recognized for its hospitality, and it extended little welcome to the newly arrived Mr. Bajaj, a 20-something Indian immigrant who smelled an opportunity to nudge the nation\u2019s capital into the national conversation about fine dining. He planned to begin with the Bombay Club, an elegant restaurant specializing in Indian cuisine, a term that at the time was widely considered an oxymoron.         \n\nLandlord after landlord rejected his proposal, more than one on the grounds that \u201cIndian restaurants smell,\u201d Mr. Bajaj recalled. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how hard it was to get a space. But I never gave up.\u201d         \n\nToday Mr. Bajaj, though not widely known outside the district, is arguably the most successful restaurateur in Washington. And his trajectory over the last 25 years mirrors that of a city that has gone from a paragon of urban dysfunction to a wellspring of prosperity.         \n\nHe celebrated the opening of  \n, his eighth restaurant here, in early May. A modern brasserie, it is pitched to a younger audience, complete with decorative taxidermy and house-made charcuterie. Its grand opening drew a gaggle of V.I.P.\u2019s, including Senators Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, and Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican.         \n\nFrom the start, Mr. Bajaj showed a knack for luring the elite, with a nuanced rogan josh and white-glove service at the Bombay Club. (The first President Bush was an early customer. It was also where, late last year, the Washington Post publisher Katharine Weymouth first suggested to her uncle Donald E. Graham that the family consider selling the newspaper.)         \n\nBut Washington was a different city when Mr. Bajaj arrived. \u201cThe culinary scene was not here in the \u201980s,\u201d he said in the clipped accent of his native New Delhi.         \n\nNeither was the affluence that has, according to 2011 Census data, made the area home to the highest median household income in the country \u2014 a status impossible to imagine in the crime-stricken \u201980s and scandal-addled \u201990s, when the municipal budget fell into such disarray that the federal government seized control of the city\u2019s finances. Rob Pitingolo, a research associate with the Urban Institute, cautions that the high income figures obscure lingering socioeconomic disparities, particularly in the heart of the city, but they reveal significant growth in what has always been Mr. Bajaj\u2019s target audience.         \n\nThe influential Spanish chef and restaurateur  \n, based in the district, and Eric Ziebold, who left Per Se in New York to open  \n here in 2004, are among many culinary heavyweights who have thrived in the resurgent city. Tom Sietsema, The Washington Post\u2019s restaurant critic, said: \u201cPeople look at Washington as an important place to eat in a way that they didn\u2019t even four or five years ago. Ashok has certainly contributed to that.\u201d         \n\nMost of the restaurants in Mr. Bajaj\u2019s  \n are tightly concentrated around the Penn Quarter area, which didn\u2019t have much to recommend it when he first set up shop there, save for its proximity to halls of power.         \n\nBeyond the Bombay Club, located within shouting distance of the White House, is an array of lavishly appointed, critically lauded properties that speak to his range as both operator and epicure. They include  \n, where Justice Antonin Scalia is known to sip martinis while lunching on regional Italian cuisine, and the  \n and  \n, power-dining canteens where Tony Conte, a chef whom Mr. Bajaj recruited from Jean-Georges in New York, churns out subtly edgy new American cuisine.         \n\n\u201cThe goal was to be close to the Old Executive Office Building, the I.M.F., the World Bank, the White House,\u201d Mr. Bajaj said. \u201cI wanted to open where I felt I\u2019d have an international clientele, with people who had traveled.\u201d         \n\nHe was resting his elbows on a table in another Penn Quarter restaurant,  \n. Besuited and stiffly pressed, he watched a stream of dishes emerge from the kitchen: a glossy trapezoid of tamarind-scented cod; a copper vessel of crisped, slivered okra tossed with curry leaves; and palak chaat, a house favorite that is essentially a fried spinach salad in yogurt dressing.         \n\nRasika opened in 2005. Its critical success is close to unprecedented for an Indian-American restaurant. (Tabla, Danny Meyer and Floyd Cardoz\u2019s place in New York, was a notable exception before it closed in 2010.) Last October, Mr. Sietsema  \n, his highest rating, calling it \u201cthe best Indian restaurant in the country.\u201d Vikram Sunderam, executive chef of Rasika and its sister,  \n, is an alumnus of the  \n in London, which Mr. Bajaj managed before coming to Washington.         \n\nRasika West End was inspired in part by the congestion inside the original, and its opening last year underscored what Mr. Bajaj calls his \u201cstrong passion to educate the American public\u201d about Indian cuisine. It was local news when the Clintons celebrated their 37th anniversary there.
