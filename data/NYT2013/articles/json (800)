{"headline": "\u2018That\u2019s as Bad as It Gets\u2019", "body": "\nHUNTINGDON, Tenn. \u2014 Hannah heard her mother\u2019s muffled cries for help. They came from the bedroom, a sort of guesthouse that sat behind her grandparents\u2019 home off a narrow winding road in the hills of West Tennessee.         \n\nHannah, 14, looked in the window and saw her father, his lip bloodied, on top of her mother, choking her.         \n\nIn the chaos of the next few minutes, after her grandfather unlocked the door with a key and collapsed to the ground, and while her grandmother called the police, Hannah stepped between her parents to prevent them from striking each other. Both her parents went to jail that night.         \n\n\u201cMy mama was trying to get out of the room and he wouldn\u2019t let her,\u201d said Hannah, her honeyed voice smoothing edges from her consonants and slowing her vowels. \u201cSo he started going towards her to hit her. I got in front of her, stepped in front of her, and told him that he wasn\u2019t to hit her. He was counting to three, telling me to get out of the way. And he got to three and I still wouldn\u2019t move because I didn\u2019t want him hitting her and going to jail or prison forever. But he went to jail anyways.\u201d         \n\nWess and Monica did not rebut their daughter\u2019s version of events from that Friday night last fall. They were married for 18 years and had four children, ages 5 to 16. They used to sing in a gospel quintet and take family vacations. Their home was filled with family photographs from a simpler time, not long ago.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just had two bad years,\u201d Wess said this past spring. \u201cFor some reason.\u201d         \n\nHannah saw the worst of it. Her parents admitted that the family had been tattered by infidelity and addictions to prescription painkillers and antidepressants. They had moved too many times to count, for a time living without water or electricity. Beyond domestic assaults, there had been arrests for acts of desperation, like stealing gas and shoplifting food.         \n\nAt separate times, each parent spent about a month in jail last fall. Hannah visited them and cried.         \n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t like seeing them like that,\u201d she said.         \n\nThe only constant in her life was Carroll Academy, a school run by the Carroll County Juvenile Court. Hannah has spent parts of the last three school years there, and played the past two seasons on the girls basketball team, the Lady Jaguars, who have now lost 213 games in a row.         \n\nFor nearly two decades, Carroll Academy, a one-hallway school set in the one-story wing of a former hospital, has been a catch basin for teenagers slipping through society\u2019s cracks. Through the course of a typical school year, 100 or more students from a five-county area are sent there to try to regain their footing.         \n\nMost students come for a few months. Hannah may be there a few years.         \n\n\u201cShe\u2019s one of the top 10 percent of cases here,\u201d Randy Hatch, a probation officer who has been the director of Carroll Academy since it opened, said this spring. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly from lack of parenting, not behavior problems on her behalf. We know there are two active warrants for their arrest. What if they get taken to jail? Where does she go? That\u2019s as bad as it gets.\u201d         \n\nOff a dirt road about 30 miles away, Hannah\u2019s parents sat together on a sofa inside the two-bedroom trailer they rented. The family car sat lifelessly outside, its necessary repairs beyond the family budget. Monica, 34, said she could not work because of chronic back pain. Wess, 37, had unsteady employment at a sawmill.         \n\nHannah would sleep either on the couch or on an air mattress in one of the bedrooms. She and her mother had decorated one bedroom wall with photographs of Hannah playing for the Lady Jaguars, although her parents had never been to Hannah\u2019s games.         \n\n\u201cShe\u2019s grown up a whole lot,\u201d Monica said, her husband nudged close beside her, all their children gone, staying with other relatives. \u201cMaybe what she\u2019s seen, she\u2019ll look back and she won\u2019t follow it \u2014 I hope. She says she won\u2019t \u2014 which I said, too. I don\u2019t know. Stress can do a lot of stuff. It really gets you. But she has. She\u2019s growed up a whole lot.\u201d         \n\nWest Tennessee is covered in forests and cotton fields, sprinkled with decaying towns loosely strung together by two-lane roads. From Huntingdon, a shrinking town of about 4,000 residents anchored by the stately Carroll County courthouse on a photogenic square, Nashville is about two hours to the east, and Memphis is two hours to the west. Interstate 40, which connects those two cities, is about 20 miles to the south.         \n\nIt is a rural place, quietly troubled by the hollowing plagues of small-town America \u2014 unemployment, drug abuse and teenage pregnancy among them. The problems lurk in the shadows between landscaped brick homes and the bucolic countryside.         \n\nWest Tennessee may be merely a proxy for anywhere. There might be a thousand Carroll Counties around the country, proud and simple places, fading almost imperceptibly with the slow passing of another time, where old-timers wish for a future more like the past, and the young people have little imagination for anything other than the present.         \n\nThe area around Huntingdon was once freckled with manufacturing plants, many in the garment industry. For a long time, factory jobs seemed bequeathed from one generation to the next. But over the past couple of decades, coinciding with the lifetimes of today\u2019s teenagers, most of the major plants closed. Their shells turned to rust and shrank into the weeds behind leaning fences and locked gates.         \n\nIn the past year, among other setbacks, a nearby munitions manufacturer and a company that makes farm fences and troughs each cut several hundred jobs. In March, the unemployment rate in Carroll County was 12.3 percent, ranking it 90th among 95 counties in Tennessee \u2014 itself a laggard in employment nationally. The four neighboring counties that make up Carroll Academy\u2019s jurisdiction have persistent double-digit unemployment, too.         \n\nDrugs are an ever-evolving worry. Carroll County Judge Larry Logan helped create Carroll Academy in 1994 in the midst of what he felt was a crack cocaine epidemic.         \n\n\u201cI thought this is the end of the world,\u201d Logan said. \u201cAnd then meth came along.\u201d         \n\nHe and other judges sign court orders nearly every week granting law enforcement agencies the right to raid suspected methamphetamine labs. Meth use remains unusual among teenagers, if not their parents, officials said, but marijuana use and prescription-drug abuse are rampant.         \n\n\u201cI fear that we have lost two full generations of people to drugs,\u201d Logan said.         \n\nThose generations are uncommonly condensed. While birthrates among teenagers continue to fall across the country and in Tennessee, the state still has a teenage birthrate about 25 percent higher than the national average. The pregnancy rate in Carroll County, 27.5 per 1,000 female teenagers in 2010, is higher than most. Three of the other four counties served by Carroll Academy are higher than that.         \n\nTwo of Hannah\u2019s teammates from her first season with the Lady Jaguars, among the three who received high school diplomas in 2012, were single, unemployed and raising babies this spring. A teammate on this season\u2019s team had two children from different fathers. A 14-year-old boy at the school was absent one day this spring to attend the birth of his child.         \n\nIt has all combined to create a swath of the population seemingly stuck in a spin cycle of inertia. Many with the ability and drive to leave the area already have. The concern is that many struggling teenagers appear headed toward difficult lives like those of their parents. The cycle repeats.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they realize what\u2019s out there,\u201d Logan said of many students at Carroll Academy, \u201cbecause of the way they\u2019re living.\u201d         \n\nA year ago, Hannah was a tall and lanky 13-year-old seventh grader. Her cherub face and sweet disposition attracted older boys and made girls jealous. While most of her Lady Jaguars teammates protected themselves with a hard, if fragile, veneer, using bravado to convey worldliness, Hannah wore a cloak of vulnerability.         \n\nA year later, Hannah still leaned closer to childhood than adulthood, drawing hearts on her notebooks, absent-mindedly singing to herself, biting her nails and blushing at attention. She had gained a noticeable amount of weight, but kept hidden what she had seen and been through over the past year.         \n\nUnlike most of her basketball teammates, she saw Carroll Academy not as a punishment, but as a sanctuary.         \n\nThe sign in front describes it as a \u201cState-Licensed Facility for Grades 6-12 Operated by the Carroll County Juvenile Court.\u201d For most area teenagers, it is a deterrent for bad behavior. Get in trouble, they are warned, and you might end up at Carroll Academy. You might earn your way out with good behavior and grades, but that usually takes at least six months.         \n\nRules are strict. Students must dress in black pants and white button-down shirts. Boys\u2019 hair must be cut short; girls must wear theirs short or in a ponytail. Students are brought to school in unmarked white vans, and walk silently in single-file lines to be inspected for contraband, from cellphones and gum to switchblades and drugs.         \n\nTransgressions that land teenagers at Carroll Academy generally fall into one of two categories. One is delinquent behavior, the types of things that would get adults arrested \u2014 drugs, vandalism, assault. The other is unruly behavior, like truancy and uncontrollable conduct, at home or school. About 80 percent of the students are boys.         \n\nMost arrive with a combination of anxiety and fear. Some, like Hannah, quickly realize that it is a cocoon from the world outside \u2014 free of bullying, filled with structure, staffed by attentive adults. Students are fed breakfast and lunch; for some, it is all they eat.         \n\nHannah arrived when she was 12, after she admitted stealing prescription pills from her mother and bringing them to school under orders from girls who had threatened to beat her up. It was Monica, wanting to teach Hannah a lesson, who called the school.         \n\nIt was only this spring that Hannah acknowledged that it was a lie \u2014 a lie conceived by her father, Hannah said, so that he could take the pills and avoid the wrath of his wife. Hannah wants to graduate from Carroll Academy. She likes the attention and a predictable schedule. She likes playing on the basketball team. She has flitting dreams of becoming a doctor or a veterinarian.         \n\nHannah\u2019s parents do not like that she goes to Carroll Academy. Getting her to the van stop in the nearest town is inconvenient, and picking her up after basketball games (when school vans do not run) can cost an hour of time and $20 in gas money, if the car is running at all. But if Hannah does not attend, her parents could end up in jail. The juvenile court views truancy as a parent problem, not a child one.         \n\nAsk Hannah what she wants more than anything in her life, and her request is simple. She just wants to go back in time.         \n\n\u201cI wish that my mom and dad would stop fighting and everything would be fine,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we\u2019d go to church.\u201d         \n\nIt was midmorning on a Wednesday in March, and Hannah had missed school for several days. Carroll Academy officials believed her family had moved, but were uncertain where to find them. They feared that they might not see Hannah again.         \n\nA car rolled up to the school entrance, tracked by security cameras. Hannah and a man approached the door. They were met by Patrick Steele, the school\u2019s no-nonsense security director.         \n\nThe man, Terry, was a cousin of Wess; their fathers were brothers, and Terry was a groomsman in Wess and Monica\u2019s wedding.         \n\nTerry apologized profusely to Steele. He explained that Hannah was staying with him and his wife, Morgan, just as she had for much of last summer, when Terry found the family living without electricity and water, the cupboards bare of food. Terry promised to get Hannah to the van pickup spot on time every morning.         \n\nThey also discussed why Hannah had not been taking Adderall, long prescribed to treat her diagnosed attention-deficit disorder. The school could tell when Hannah did not take her medication \u2014 her work got sloppy and her behavior turned uncharacteristically erratic. The week before, she had failed a math test and spent time in solitary detention for disrupting class.         \n\nHer parents did not think she needed Adderall every day, especially on weekends, but relatives believe they wanted the extra pills for themselves, either to consume or sell. Her parents held Hannah\u2019s latest prescription, but were unwilling to pass it to relatives or bring the pills to the school.         \n\nLegally, Steele needed to deal directly with Hannah\u2019s parents, who still had custody of their daughter. Terry dialed a number, asked for Wess, and handed the phone to Steele. He quietly told Wess that he and Monica must arrange a visit to Carroll Academy within the next week.         \n\nHannah held her books to her chest, chewed on her lower lip and listened quietly.         \n\nTerry, 32, and Morgan, 23, were raising two children of their own when they decided to take in Hannah and her two younger siblings \u2014 a 12-year-old brother and 5-year-old sister. (Hannah\u2019s older brother, 16, stayed mostly with other relatives and was a promising football player at the same small high school that produced San Francisco 49ers linebacker Patrick Willis.)         \n\nThey lived in a mobile home on a skinny road outside of nearby Camden. Terry had a full-time job as a plant manager for a metal-roofing company.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not rich, but we\u2019re fed,\u201d Terry said.         \n\nTerry and Morgan talked about custody of Hannah, at least, but they were leery of the legal wrangling and wading too deep into the convoluted politics of a sprawling family.         \n\n\u201cWe just want them to eat,\u201d Terry said. \u201cHave something to eat, have a place to lay down and go to sleep, where it\u2019s warm in the wintertime and cool in the summertime. And for her to get to school and have a fighting chance. If she don\u2019t get an education, especially in this part of the country, she\u2019s never going to amount to nothing.\u201d         \n\nMorgan grew up in the area. She got pregnant at 14, but had a miscarriage, and then had a son at age 17. She did not finish high school, and spent time this spring working on her G.E.D., studying some of the same math Hannah was learning at Carroll Academy. Morgan and Terry met a few years ago, married and had a daughter, who was now 1.         \n\n\u201cI love Hannah to death,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cIf I could adopt her, I would. For the simple fact that I know what Hannah is going through. I literally know what she\u2019s going through.\u201d         \n\nThe couple tried to wrap Hannah in a world more typical of other young teenagers. They got her a cellphone. They took her shopping for a pair of jeans. They treated her to fast food. Morgan took her to have her eyebrows waxed.         \n\nHannah was on birth-control pills, but vowed not to have sex until she was married. She had ended relationships with boys who expected otherwise. Morgan told Hannah to wait until she was at least 20 before having children.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m scared she\u2019ll end up out of school, no baby\u2019s daddy, and won\u2019t have nobody \u2014 and won\u2019t know what to do,\u201d Morgan said, speaking from experience. \u201cAnd around here, that\u2019s pretty much to a T what happens to most every girl that doesn\u2019t have any parents.\u201d         \n\nIt was 20 minutes before the Lady Jaguars\u2019 last regular-season game. The band directors at Bethel University, in nearby McKenzie, had not made attendance mandatory, but 45 of the 55 members of the pep band came, wearing T-shirts that read \u201cCarroll Academy Lady Jaguars.\u201d         \n\nThey filled several rows of bleachers. The home cheering section, often almost empty, was larger than that for the visiting side, maybe for the first time since Hatch, the school\u2019s director, started the boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 teams in 1998.         \n\nThe gym filled with unfamiliar revelry and optimism. The band played the national anthem and a full slate of pep songs during timeouts. It cheered lustily when a girl named Hayley scored the team\u2019s first point midway through the first quarter, closing Camden High\u2019s lead to 9-1.         \n\nThe atmosphere could not prevent Carroll Academy from trailing at halftime, 52-5.         \n\n\u201cIt was too loud in there,\u201d a senior named Caitlyn said in the locker room. \u201cI couldn\u2019t concentrate.\u201d         \n\nHatch was not pleased with the effort, but his stern words were softened by a face typically on the verge of a smile. He lectured the girls. Hannah bit her nails. Earlier in the season, she scored a team-high 10 points in a game. But her high-arcing 3-point shot was not falling today. One overeager effort was blocked by a gym rafter.         \n\n\u201cHold your head up and be proud of who you are,\u201d Hatch said.         \n\nThe final score was 83-10.         \n\nAfterward, 10 young men from the Bethel band slipped from the bleachers and approached the Lady Jaguars in front of their bench. They sang an a cappella version of the Bruno Mars song \u201cJust the Way You Are,\u201d ending on their knees. Each young man handed a girl a stuffed animal to keep. Some girls were in tears.         \n\nAs the groups huddled together for pictures, Hannah beamed. She was a veteran, one of just two playing for the Lady Jaguars for the second season, but she remained the youngest player.         \n\nA few teammates graduated in May, and most of the others will not be back to Carroll Academy in the fall. But Hannah probably will.         \n\n\u201cShe does not need to leave here,\u201d Hatch said. \u201cShe should remain here until she\u2019s a senior. That way I\u2019ll know she gets a diploma.\u201d         \n\nBy the time school got out for the summer, Hannah\u2019s world had shuffled again. Her birthday came and went in June without a call from her parents. She no longer lived with Morgan and Terry, who had lost his job. Other cousins had taken her in, wanting to make sure she had a place to sleep, food to eat and a way to get to school when it resumes in August. They, too, talked of requesting long-term custody.         \n\nIt might be out of necessity. By mid-July, having violated their probations, both of Hannah\u2019s parents were in jail.         \n\nOn the first day of practice, last October, there were five girls on Tonya Lutz\u2019s basketball team at Carroll Academy. They inherited a 184-game losing streak, probably the longest in the nation, with little chance of ending it.         \n\nLutz had been coaching against hope since 2004.         \n\n\u201cWorst hand I\u2019ve had,\u201d Lutz said.         \n\nLutz, 37, was a former all-district point guard and a high school state champion from a nearby town. Every fall, a new batch of wayward teens appeared on her court. Most had never played organized team sports. Few played much basketball.         \n\nOne girl, a 10th grader named Kiana, played little for the previous season\u2019s team. Back then, Kiana was afraid of the ball. Now she was likely to be the team\u2019s captain.         \n\nLutz taught the girls what the lines on the court meant. She taught them to dribble, shoot and play defense. She yelled at them, encouraged them and hugged them.         \n\nSometimes the Lady Jaguars lost by nearly 100 points, and sometimes they struggled to score at all. By the end, almost every one of them wished the season could go on forever.         \n\nMany wanted to grow into someone like their coach: married, two children, a new brick home outside of town. She seemed to have it all, and more than most could imagine for themselves.         \n\nWhen the girls had big news to report \u2014 a good grade, a new job, a college acceptance, a passed drug screen, a pregnancy \u2014 Lutz was often the first person they told. They called her Ms. Tonya, the formal salutation paired with the informal first name that is part of the culture of manners in West Tennessee.         \n\nAnd then, two weeks into practice for the Lady Jaguars, two weeks before a season opener, Lutz had something she wanted to tell Kiana: She was thinking of quitting.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why I went to her first,\u201d Lutz said.         \n\nKiana was raised mostly by a single father and just a hint of a mother. As a ninth grader at a public high school, Kiana hid prescription painkillers that a friend named Leslee had taken from a stepmother. The school\u2019s zero-tolerance policy toward drugs landed both girls at Carroll Academy, and onto Lutz\u2019s 2011-12 team.         \n\nLeslee earned her way back to her former school to start the year. Kiana was still, for now, at Carroll Academy.         \n\nLutz told Kiana that her 13-year-old son wanted to play basketball for the middle school. Her 9-year-old daughter was involved in plenty of activities, too. Her husband worked swing shifts at the aluminum plant off the highway. The couple would probably have to hire someone to watch their kids so that Lutz could coach.         \n\nThat is what gnawed at her, the hypocrisy of it all. To coach girls who needed more role models, she was going to leave her own children with someone else?         \n\nKiana, round-cheeked and soft-spoken, a girl with no mother of her own to count on, told Lutz that her priority should be as a mother.         \n\n\u201cShe understood,\u201d Lutz said, fighting through tears.         \n\nShe hated the thought of resigning, and the message it would send. For years, Lutz had preached the gospel of never quitting. Not in basketball, no matter the score. Not in life, no matter the odds.         \n\nIt had not occurred to her that even quitting could be spun into a worthwhile life lesson.         \n\n\u201cHopefully they\u2019ll respect me in the end,\u201d Lutz said. \u201cBecause this is what a mom is supposed to do. A mom is supposed to put her children above anything else.\u201d         \n\nThe idea, 15 years ago, was simple: Use sports to teach lessons that cannot always be taught in a classroom. The students at Carroll Academy might learn teamwork, discipline and trust. If nothing else, basketball provided structure and diversions for children whose lives had little of either.         \n\nWith enough interest to sometimes require tryouts, the boys\u2019 team usually won a few games a year. Not the girls. With a low number of girls enrolled at Carroll Academy, most were required to play on the basketball team. Few had experience. The Lady Jaguars had won six games in their history, and none since 2006.         \n\nHatch, the school\u2019s 54-year-old director, had coached the boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 teams during their early years. He handed them off nearly a decade ago to spend more time with his family.         \n\nBrian McDowell, one of Carroll Academy\u2019s security officers, took over the boys team. Lutz was hired to coach the girls. She taught a life-skills class, too, covering topics from creating healthy meals to caring for an infant. But most people thought of her as the basketball coach.         \n\nBefore she went to work that day last October, she told her husband to pray, because she was not sure she would return with a job at Carroll Academy. Hatch surprised her. He responded to her coaching resignation with a supportive hug.         \n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been here a long time,\u201d Lutz said Hatch told her. \u201cThese kids love you. You belong in the classroom.\u201d         \n\nHatch\u2019s first inclination was to cancel the season before it started. It was too late to hire a new coach, and there was no one else on the school\u2019s small staff to do it. But when he called the girls together, it was Alleyah who suggested that Hatch just do the job himself.         \n\nHatch sent the text message to his wife at 9:01 a.m. on Monday, Oct. 29.         \n\n\u201cTonya resigned as girls BB coach,\u201d it read. \u201cLooks like I\u2019m coming out of retirement.\u201d         \n\nThose closest to him worried that the stress of coaching would not help his health, including persistent concerns over ulcers and his heart. Hatch used to be temperamental on the sideline, especially when opponents ran up the score on the helpless Jaguars or officials called questionable fouls against a team facing an 80-point deficit. He once pulled his team off the court in protest. He once instructed a player to hand the ball to an opponent several times in a row to embarrass an unbending opposing coach.         \n\n\u201cHe could really come unglued in his earlier years,\u201d Hatch\u2019s wife, Vicki, said. \u201cHe\u2019s a lot more mellow now. He wanted the girls to take it more seriously when he was younger. Now he can see more of the big picture. He wants them to have fun and make memories.\u201d         \n\nIn December, Hatch\u2019s Lady Jaguars had a rare halftime lead, 19-16, against Jackson Prep, a private school from another conference. Carroll Academy lost, 40-27. (\u201cBad coaching,\u201d Hatch said.) The game was sandwiched between two losses to area public schools \u2014 68-5 and 69-5.         \n\nBy Christmas, Kiana was gone, having earned her way back to public school. Hatch\u2019s roster settled in at nine, including two girls from last season\u2019s team: Hannah, an eighth grader, and Alleyah, a ninth grader.         \n\nAlleyah scored her only point of the season on a free throw. Hannah, whose ability to make 3-pointers was matched only by her willingness to take them, using a two-handed shot from her chest, made three and scored 10 points in a January loss.         \n\nThe Lady Jaguars finished 0-29. They were outscored, 1,845 to 306, an average defeat of 64-11.         \n\nLutz could not bear to watch. She attended only two games, once to sell admission tickets at the front door and the other to work at the concession stand. Through her peripheral vision, she saw untapped potential.         \n\n\u201cIt was killing me,\u201d she said.         \n\nIt bothered her seeing how the team took the court. While Hatch\u2019s team arrived with unscripted nonchalance, warming up before the games by shooting haphazardly, Lutz always coached the girls to run onto the floor, circle the court and perform layup drills with hustle.         \n\nShe thought she could turn Hannah, taller than all her classmates and heavier than a year earlier, into an inside player, one with the shooting form to make her dangerous from outside. She saw other girls, some she had in class, and thought about how they might have reacted to her firebrand style and attention to detail.         \n\n\u201cThere was a lot of times I was wanting to yell out, because I knew who could drive and who could shoot the 3-pointer,\u201d Lutz said. \u201cAnd I had to really bite my tongue. Lot of times I had to back away because I was liable to stand up and start coaching from the sidelines.\u201d         \n\nThere was nothing she could do about it now. The Lady Jaguars were not her team anymore.         \n\nOn a different court, it was just how Lutz pictured it. The whistle was around her neck, the girls sprinted through drills, and parents cared enough to come to practice.         \n\nFinally, she thought. A basketball team I can mold. A team that can win.         \n\nThere were nine girls, choreographed like a stage production. With a melody of squeaks and thumps, they performed the three-man weave. When Lutz blew the whistle, they rearranged themselves and began a different drill.         \n\nThe girls wore practice shirts that read Lady Tigers, not Lady Jaguars. They were ages 9, 10 and 11. Lutz waltzed up and down the court, whistle hanging from her mouth, orchestrating their movements. In one practice, she covered the 1-2-1-1 trap, the pivot foot, and how to take a charge.         \n\nShe stepped in to teach the girls the crossover dribble, and the reverse spin dribble to get around a defender. Just a year ago, she was trying to teach Alleyah simply to bring the ball upcourt.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m always like, \u2018Why can\u2019t those girls learn like these girls learn?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Lutz said.         \n\nWhen word spread over the winter that Lutz had stepped down at Carroll Academy, she received a call asking if she wanted to coach younger girls, including her own 9-year-old daughter, Lydia.         \n\nCoach? And spend time with her children? Absolutely.         \n\nPractices were held at the gleaming Gleason High gym. On the wall at one end of the court were large photographs, eight feet across, of Gleason\u2019s state championship teams. One of them was dated 1991-92. On the left end of the front row was a girl with big, curly blond hair. She was No. 24, a sophomore point guard named Tonya Parham, who went on to college and married a boy named Chris Lutz.         \n\nIn the nearby foyer, on the Gleason Wall of Fame, were plaques honoring 52 inductees. Tonya Parham was one.         \n\nIn the first game that Lutz coached for the Lady Tigers, they won. They finished the season 6-4 \u2014 the same number of victories that Carroll Academy has mustered in 15 years.         \n\n\u201cI hate that I can\u2019t bring this over there,\u201d Lutz said.         \n\nBut she just might. And that is because these girls, with their crossover dribbles and well-practiced defensive traps, will soon feed into the area\u2019s middle schools and high schools.         \n\nAnd, in a few years, these girls, including Lutz\u2019s own daughter, will play the Lady Jaguars from Carroll Academy.         \n\nA year earlier, Alleyah was a 14-year-old breeze of a girl. She was not quite 5 feet tall and was close to 100 pounds only if she held a bagful of basketballs. The biggest things about her were a smile as wide as her ears and a fast-talking sassiness refined in the housing projects.         \n\nOnce, when a Lady Jaguars teammate had the audacity to pass her the ball, Alleyah watched it slip through her fingers. She turned and put a hand on her hip.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why y\u2019all are throwing me the damn ball,\u201d she said through a mouth full of braces.         \n\nBut there she was this past January, playing point guard against neighboring Huntingdon High. The Lady Jaguars were without their two best players, girls who could be trusted to bring the ball upcourt and score a few points.         \n\nHuntingdon persistently pressured the dribbler, stole the ball and scored on uncontested layups. At halftime, Carroll Academy trailed, 57-0. Alleyah cried in the locker room.         \n\n\u201cThis is hard,\u201d she said.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, honey,\u201d Coach Hatch said. \u201cThere\u2019s no one else.\u201d         \n\nAlleyah played the whole game. Carroll Academy lost, 91-4.         \n\n\u201cI ran out of breath,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t get no breaks. I felt like it was 100 degrees in the gym.\u201d         \n\nBut she did it. The girl who once reprimanded teammates for passing her the ball played every minute at point guard.         \n\n\u201cBefore it started, I didn\u2019t think I could do it,\u201d Alleyah said. Her smile, freed from the braces of a year before, stretched wide. \u201cNow, when I accomplished it, I felt proud.\u201d         \n\nAlleyah, now a 15-year-old ninth grader, wanted to get out of Carroll Academy. And it somehow seemed possible.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to be a cheerleader,\u201d she said in February. \u201cI wanted to be a cheerleader since I was little.\u201d         \n\nThere are no cheerleaders at Carroll Academy, and Alleyah has looked the past couple of years as if she might be a permanent resident there. She got into fights in middle school. Her mother could not control her, and Alleyah was a fixture on the streets of the neighborhood, ripe with dropouts and drug dealers. She was a tiny dynamo of head-shaking self-destruction.         \n\nShe spent much of last year, when she was not playing for the Lady Jaguars, getting kicked out of class. She talked, she argued and she passed notes. She was a regular in detention. She had been wrung through the various punishments that Carroll Academy doles out, including a grueling string of calisthenics in the hallway that made most misbehaving students nearly collapse from exhaustion.         \n\nNone of it seemed to faze Alleyah.         \n\nThe primary incentive for good behavior and good grades is Carroll Academy\u2019s system of levels. Students begin at Level 1 and, after several weeks of good grades and a clean disciplinary record, can advance to Level 2. Keep it up for another stretch of weeks, and Level 3 awaits. Perks are slowly added \u2014 more talking, an easing of rules about makeup and hair. Get to Level 5, and a return to \u201cregular school,\u201d as the students call it, awaits.         \n\nA year ago, Alleyah was tethered to Level 1. She failed two drug tests, which set her back again. But this year was different.         \n\n\u201cI just want to prove everybody wrong,\u201d she said.         \n\nMostly, she wanted to prove it to Steele, the school\u2019s security director.         \n\n\u201cHe says I\u2019m going to be here until I\u2019m 18,\u201d Alleyah said.         \n\nSteele first noticed her a decade earlier, an effervescent toddler waving to him along his van route. Then, a couple of years ago, Steele had a new stop. It was a seventh grader assigned to Carroll Academy because of unruliness and fighting. He pulled up to the address. Out came a 13-year-old Alleyah.         \n\nThat was in January 2011. Alleyah has not been back to regular school since.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to get a Carroll Academy diploma,\u201d she said earlier this spring. \u201cI want to get my high school diploma and I want to go to college and be a cosmetologist. I want to do hair. I used to do the hair on my Barbie doll. One day, I flat-ironed it, and it melted. I thought it was going to grow back.\u201d         \n\nSpeaking with a confidence unknown a year earlier, a maturity laced with optimism, Alleyah said she had not failed a drug test in more than six months. Only once was she called into the hallway for calisthenics. She generally kept pace with her school work. She had grown to like basketball.         \n\nIf she could keep it together, she would not have to attend summer school. Her probation officer would send her to regular school in the fall.         \n\nThe thought was both tantalizing and frightening.         \n\n\u201cIt would be hard, but I think I could do it,\u201d Alleyah said of leaving Carroll Academy. \u201cI just want to be in high school.\u201d         \n\nAlleyah\u2019s bedroom at her father\u2019s house was bathed in black light, turning the walls a psychedelic purple. A color wheel on the floor added rotating splashes of color. A lava lamp glowed on the window sill. The room was in perfect order, the bed neatly made, and Alleyah was happy to show it off. She had changed out of her Carroll Academy uniform of black pants, white shirt and a ponytail. Her hair was styled, her face covered in makeup, her wide smile framed in lipstick. She wore jeans, a tight T-shirt and suede boots.         \n\n\u201cPeople say she\u2019s a cute girl, and I don\u2019t want people taking advantage,\u201d said her father, Randall. \u201cIt worries me. It worries me. I know how guys are at 15. I know what they\u2019re thinking. I used to be there. And there are some things little girls aren\u2019t going to talk to their Daddy about. I know she\u2019s smarter than that. We talk about it. Hopefully she just uses her head. A lot of girls don\u2019t.\u201d         \n\nRandall, 45, grew up in McKenzie. He had not had full-time employment for several years, since a longtime furniture factory in town closed, eliminating hundreds of jobs. This spring, he had a temporary job, about 30 miles away, making $9.15 an hour on an assembly line building lawn mowers, starting at 6 each morning.         \n\nHe usually woke Alleyah at 5 and dropped her at her mother\u2019s house, a few blocks away. After school, the Carroll Academy van usually dropped Alleyah back at her grandmother\u2019s house nearby.         \n\n\u201cI wonder, did she get off to school O.K.?\u201d Randall said. \u201cGetting up early and living in this neighborhood, leaving her here, it worries me.\u201d         \n\nRandall\u2019s house was on Walnut Circle, an area of McKenzie that locals call the projects. It is a ring of public housing, simple brick homes set on an open lawn across the railroad tracks from McKenzie\u2019s struggling downtown.         \n\nIn front of her father, Alleyah recited a list of drugs that she could find with little effort a few steps from her door \u2014 marijuana, Ecstasy, prescription medications like hydrocodone, Xanax and Adderall. She went through a phase where she smoked synthetic marijuana, available at local convenience stores and now notorious for worrisome side effects.         \n\n\u201cI get tempted,\u201d Alleyah said. \u201cIf I was hanging out here, I\u2019d be smoking. But I try to stay in my little bubble.\u201d         \n\nShe admitted to having smoked marijuana two weeks earlier. In the weeks before that, Randall came home and recognized the smell. He traced it to under Alleyah\u2019s bed, not far from the color wheel \u2014 an aluminum can, sliced and dented into a makeshift pipe. Alleyah confessed.         \n\n\u201cWeed,\u201d Randall said. \u201cAnd alcohol. Those two things worry me. I used to drink heavy, but I haven\u2019t done it in 11 years. I know kids that age are going to experiment. They\u2019re going to get bored. And she says she does it because she\u2019s bored. I tell her to pick up a book. You\u2019ve got to have books to survive. No education, no cosmetology job.\u201d         \n\nIt was April. Alleyah was at Level 4 at Carroll Academy. An exit was within reach. Her father just wanted her to get to high school and get away from the life he had lived.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to offer her in McKenzie,\u201d he said. \u201cI want her to get out. I don\u2019t want her to work at McDonald\u2019s all her whole life. Or do like Daddy did, and work in a factory and have that factory close and be without a job. I don\u2019t want her to take that same path. There\u2019s better stuff out there if she can just get away.\u201d         \n\nThree weeks later, at Carroll Academy, Alleyah was called into the security office. Her probation officer was there. So was Steele.         \n\nThey had seen her Facebook page. Among the tough-talking posts and below the profile photo of her giving the middle finger were pictures of Alleyah smoking what appeared to be marijuana, including with Summer, a 19-year-old former Lady Jaguars teammate who graduated and was raising a son.         \n\nAnd it showed pictures from the previous weekend of Alleyah drinking and looking intoxicated.         \n\nAlleyah was told that she was leaving Carroll Academy. She was assigned to a live-in drug and alcohol rehabilitation center 30 miles away.         \n\n\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t go?\u201d she asked Steele. \u201cWhat if I run away?\u201d         \n\n\u201cYou can run away,\u201d Steele said, \u201cand you\u2019ll probably be gone two or three days, maybe a week. And then we\u2019ll find you and pick you up. And you\u2019ll be put in custody.\u201d         \n\nThe wide smile was long gone. And, from Carroll Academy, so was Alleyah.
