{"headline": "Regulatory Nominee Vows to Speed Up Energy Reviews", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The White House has blocked several Department of Energy regulations that would require appliances, lighting and buildings to use less energy and create less global-warming pollution, as part of a broader slowdown of new antipollution rules issued by the Obama administration.         \n\nThe administration has spent as long as two years reviewing some of the energy efficiency rules proposed by the Energy Department, bypassing a 1993 executive order that in most instances requires the White House to act on proposed regulations within 90 days. Regulatory review times at the White House Office of Management and Budget are now the longest in 20 years, having spiked sharply since 2011.         \n\nWith some Congressional Democrats and environmental advocates criticizing the delays, President Obama\u2019s nominee to direct the  \n said at his Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday that his first priority would be to speed the agency\u2019s review process.         \n\nThe nominee, Howard A. Shelanski, who is now the top economist at the Federal Trade Commission, said at the  \n that he would try \u201cto ensure that regulatory review at OIRA occurs in as timely a manner as possible.\u201d His comments were an acknowledgment that the backlog is frustrating presidential policy and failing to meet the deadlines in the executive order under which regulations are reviewed.         \n\nThe proposed rules would require that refrigerators, light bulbs and electrical equipment use less energy, much as the Obama administration in its first term required automakers to commit to make cars more energy efficient.         \n\nWith a sweeping climate bill having died in the Senate in Mr. Obama\u2019s first term, his only options for major action on the issue in the second term appear to involve executive action. In one of the signature moments of his 2013 State of the Union address, he vowed that if Congress failed to act on energy and climate change, he would use his executive powers to do so.         \n\nWhile Republicans continue to criticize the administration for what they call regulatory overkill, environmental advocates and some Democrats outside the administration argue that Mr. Obama has not made good on his recent promises and has failed to show enough urgency about climate change.         \n\n\u201cThe president has pledged if Congress won\u2019t act on climate change, he will,\u201d said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, who along with five other Democrats  \n to the administration\u2019s new budget director,  \n, last week to complain about the regulatory delays. \u201cIf he is going to keep that promise, he\u2019s going to have to have O.M.B. move with a lot more clarity and alacrity,\u201d Mr. Whitehouse added, using an abbreviation for the budget office.         \n\nThe slowdown stems from a combination of factors, including high-level vacancies and election-year politics. Analysts and former administration officials said the White House, sensitive to Republican charges that it was threatening the economy by pushing out dozens of so-called  \n, reined in the process last year, leaving many major rules awaiting action for months beyond legal deadlines.         \n\nSome administration officials are also concerned that regulations have the potential to do more harm than good. \u201cIf we make refrigerators lousy, that\u2019s a big problem,\u201d  \n in  \n a book published this year about his time running the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, a small unit of the budget office responsible for reviewing regulations         \n\nIf confirmed, Mr. Shelanski will take over the unit.         \n\nThe administration\u2019s concerns about the cost of regulations are especially acute at a time when unemployment remains high.         \n\n\u201cThe administration seeks to maintain a balance between our obligation to protect the health, welfare and safety of Americans and our commitment to promoting economic growth, job creation, competitiveness and innovation,\u201d Ms. Burwell wrote in response to Mr. Whitehouse.         \n\nShe did not address why the pace of rule making had slowed so sharply in 2012 and 2013, or why the energy efficiency rules were held up. White House officials have said energy efficiency rules issued in Mr. Obama\u2019s first term would yield $400 billion in consumer savings and reduce carbon emissions by hundreds of millions of tons through 2030.         \n\nThe White House acknowledged that the pace of rule making slowed last year, but noted that it had issued major rules on power plant emissions and vehicle fuel economy in late 2011 and 2012. The administration calculates the net economic and health benefits of those two rules at $64 billion a year.         \n\nOne example of a delayed rule is an Energy Department proposal to mandate greater energy efficiency for walk-in coolers and freezers, which are common at many restaurants, supermarkets and warehouses. The measure has been awaiting action from the White House regulatory review office since September 2011.         \n\nThe delay has added more than 10 million metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, according to calculations by two independent watchdog groups. The groups, the  \n and the  \n said that each month of delay for the stalled efficiency rules creates pollution equivalent to burning 19,000 rail cars of coal.         \n\nApart from the political battles over whether the government does too much or too little environmental regulation, there is no dispute that rule making has slowed sharply since 2011.         \n\nFederal records show that the Obama administration issued rules in its first three years at a pace similar to that of previous administrations.         \n\nBut in 2012 \u2014 an election year in which the economy was the focus \u2014 the number of rules issued dropped to 424, the lowest number since the review process began in 1993. In the first three years of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency, the administration issued an average of 675 rules.         \n\nThe amount of time each proposed rule spends under review has also spiked, to 79 days last year and 141 days so far this year. The average review time over the previous 18 years was 50 days.         \n\nMr. Sunstein, who directed the regulatory affairs office from 2009 until last August, hinted at the reasons for the slowdown in a recent Harvard Law Review  \n and in \u201cSimpler,\u201d both of which describe his philosophy of regulation.         \n\nHe said that a number of other White House offices, from the National Economic Council to the office of the vice president, often weighed in on proposed rules and sometimes disagreed. He added that some rules present difficult questions of costs and benefits.         \n\n\u201cWe need to know whether the new, energy-efficient refrigerators are as good as the current ones,\u201d Mr. Sunstein wrote in his book. \u201cIf they don\u2019t refrigerate as well, then the rule is imposing a separate cost, and we need to consider that cost in our assessment.\u201d         \n\n \n, a professor of law at Georgetown University and a former top Environmental Protection Agency official who tangled with Mr. Sunstein over a number of environmental regulations in Mr. Obama\u2019s first term, said in a recent  \n that such demands for detailed analysis become \u201ca regulatory game of  \n: every time the agency meets one demand for a piece of information about the costs or benefits of a rule, it finds itself met with a new and different demand.\u201d         \n\nShe said the decision of how quickly to move now rested with Mr. Obama. \u201cThe cabinet does not need a presidential directive telling the agencies to do their work,\u201d she said, \u201crather, it needs presidential support for the work they are trying to do.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/13/us/politics/environmental-rules-delayed-as-white-house-slows-reviews.html", "date": "2013-06-12", "description": "Proposed rules that would require appliances, lighting and buildings to use less energy have languished for as long as two years awaiting approval from White House officials."}
