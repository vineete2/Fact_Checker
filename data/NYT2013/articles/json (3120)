{"headline": "To the Best of My Memory, It Was Love", "body": "\nPossibly because it\u2019s September, when it has become clear whether a romance will last or has been only the stuff of summer, I am thinking of my older cousin, Ravishing Rachel, who, in the 1950s, could walk down the street in the Catskills resort town of Fleischmanns and make old men weep.         \n\nI don\u2019t remember men literally weeping, by the way \u2014 that\u2019s hyperbole. And if I did I wouldn\u2019t trust myself, because according to an article I read recently what we consider a memory is actually a memory of a memory, which we refine every time we tell it. And as writers are known to be great embellishers and we are dealing with a story that is well over 55 years old, consider yourself forewarned.         \n\nBut I can tell you with absolute certainty that my cousin Rachel, who was about 8 years older than I was, was an actual beauty queen \u2014 although her reign was limited to Yonkers \u2014 who would one day be mother to another beauty queen and was so beautiful she shimmered.         \n\nThe older Rachel got the more beautiful she became and the more suitors there were, always guys from New York City who were staying at one of the big hotels.         \n\nExcept this one season, when Rachel, who was probably about 17 or 18, got involved with a local guy I\u2019ll call James Dean. Or, to report accurately how he was referred to in my family, \u201cThat bum, James Dean.\u201d As in, \u201cHow Rachel could be running around with a bum like James Dean when she has that nice Jewish lawyer chasing her is beyond me.\u201d James Dean, you see, was gentile, and we were Jewish, and in my family, Jewish girls could only go out with Jewish guys. I wish I had been older at the time because I could remember it better and it was a terrific family scandal. I call the guy James Dean, by the way, not because I remember what he looked like, but because this is the way I think I remember him. A lot of the local guys, when I was a kid, were James Dean-like, with the slicked-back hair and T-shirts and the souped-up cars. Maybe I took the general and made it specific.         \n\nWhat I remember more clearly was the screaming between Rachel and her mother. Then the romance was over and Rachel was exiled back home to Yonkers, maybe before summer\u2019s end. I am certain of the basics anyway: a teenage love affair thwarted by the small-minded parents; kind of \u201850s Romeo and Juliet, but with screeching tires and borscht.         \n\nDecades pass. Rachel\u2019s husbands, both of whom have high family approval ratings, are disappointments: the first, who is really trouble, spirits their children away to another country; the second has periods of anger and depression.         \n\nThen one winter, when Rachel and I are middle-aged , Rachel invites me to stay at a time-share in Mexico she had planned to stay at with her husband. It\u2019s one of the most romantic places I have ever stayed in, a building tiered like a wedding cake and built into the side of the hill, with two bedrooms and an open dining/living area and waterfalls running into a small outdoor pool. The tragedy of being there without a guy is lost on neither of us.         \n\n\u201cGood night, Cousin,\u201d I say to Rachel as we head off to our solitary bedrooms.         \n\n\u201cGood night, Cousin,\u201d she says.         \n\nWe lie around on the beach, troll fruitlessly for guys to flirt and dance with, and one day, lying on the beach, I ask Rachel about James Dean.         \n\nThe love of her teenage life, maybe her whole life, she says; not a bum, despite what the family said, smart, hard-working and he really loved her. But unfortunately, she blew it. They had been double-dating with another couple and she and the other girl got into a discussion about engagement rings, talking about how big a diamond would have to be to be acceptable.         \n\nThe conversation seemed to annoy James Dean. At the end of the evening, when he is taking Rachel home, he pulls out an engagement ring with a small stone.         \n\n\u201cI was going to give you this,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I guess it wouldn\u2019t be big enough for you.\u201d         \n\nThen he drives away.         \n\nSo her parents didn\u2019t break it up?         \n\nNo, Rachel says, it was her fault. She thought about him over the years, too. She even got his number, after her first marriage fell apart, and called him, but he was married, so that was that.         \n\nI like my version better. Let\u2019s have him roaring off, brokenhearted, as summer ends. Some things are better left unknown.
