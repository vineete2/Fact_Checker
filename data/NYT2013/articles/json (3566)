{"headline": "Friars Club Proposed for Landmark Status", "body": "\nTo most owners, landmark designation is no joke.\u00a0Repairs must be at a high level,\u00a0time is spent in review,\u00a0major changes are barred \u2014 that\u2019s nothing to laugh at.\u00a0 Now it looks as if the 1909 town house of the Friars Club, at 57 East 55th Street, may come before the Landmarks Preservation Commission. Will the Friars\u00a0be happy if their monastery is protected, or would\u00a0the commissioners get the next roast?         \n\nAround 1900 the carpet of old brownstones flanking Fifth Avenue was rewoven as entirely new town houses went up. William Earl Dodge  \n, the eccentric developer who built the Ansonia, had McKim, Mead & White design the chaste palazzo-style house at \n. Minnie Young, a widow, built the remarkable granite-front house at  \n. And the banker Harvey Fisk had Raleigh Gildersleeve create the wide Tudor fantasy at 12 East 53rd Street.         \n\nAnother of these fresh householders was the investment banker Martin Erdmann, a retired partner at Speyer & Company. In 1908 he hired Taylor & Levi to design the ebullient German Renaissance house at 57 East 55th. The Erdmann house rudely shouldered aside its creaky neighbors and pushed right out to the building line, its light-color stone shaming their gloomy brownstone, its frantic strapwork, intricate downspouts and 25-foot-high gable reproaching the dowdy row houses.         \n\nIn 1909 the magazine Architecture seemed amused at the impudence of the architects\u2019 work; \u201cas outr\u00e9 and unsuited to its surroundings\u201d as it was, \u201cits sheer cleverness cannot be denied.\u201d And the magazine allowed as how the design would probably wake up the profession, otherwise \u201clulled to sleep by monotonous repetitions of classic forms.\u201d         \n\nErdmann didn\u2019t marry. He collected  \n and went to the opera, but otherwise flew well under the radar. He did not play the ponies, drive fast cars or get in trouble with the upstairs maids.         \n\nIndeed, he had plenty of those, the staff without whom the well-to-do are hostages to their mansions. They were usually seven or eight in number, many recent immigrants who might be expected to cling to their jobs. But the censuses for 1910, 1920, 1925 and 1930 list a total 32 servants at No. 57 for the four different counts, and only one of those remained from one census to the next. That was Irish-born Sarah McCarthy, who arrived in the United States in 1924 and appears in the 1925 and 1930 censuses. With that kind of turnover, small wonder the rich were always complaining about the \u201cservant problem.\u201d         \n\nWhile Mr. Erdmann was struggling with what might really be called the employer problem, the Friars Club, founded in 1904, was about to build a striking Gothic-style clubhouse on West 48th Street, completed in 1916 and now demolished. The members called it the monastery, but they were hardly a bunch of monks. Rather, the club was for men in the theater business, actors, writers and directors.         \n\nThe 1930s were grim times for the Friars, into receivership in 1932 for nonpayment of a $1,130 butter and egg bill, and forced to vacate the West 48th Street monastery soon after. Meanwhile, back on East 55th Street Mr. Erdmann seems to have remained in comfortable circumstances, leaving $5 million when he died in 1937, after which his house went into other hands. In 1957, the Friars Club bought the old Erdmann house; Phil Silvers and Red Buttons were on the board at that time.         \n\nOver the years, Midtown\u2019s town house period gradually ground to dust, leaving only a few isolated examples. The Friars stayed put, refining the annual roast to piquantly obscene outrage, like the fabled but not really all that funny \u201cAristocrats\u201d  \n, which varies but frequently involves a family and all sorts of activities not normally referred to in a section devoted to real estate, but was, unsurprisingly, told at a sendup of Hugh Hefner in 2001.         \n\nThe proposed rezoning of Midtown East to allow for greater density has created a stir in preservation circles, provoking various organizations to propose landmark designation for a dozen or so structures, including the Friars Club. The Landmarks Preservation Commission says it is considering the matter, but Barry Dougherty, a club spokesman, says it hasn\u2019t heard of the proposal, and has taken no position.         \n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean others have not. Although the preservation organizations are pretty well lined up behind a raft of new designations, they are countered by a group of real estate, business and construction organizations called Midtown 21C: Coalition for a Globally Competitive New York, which has issued a report critical of them. Indeed, it cannot find any buildings worth designating in the area.         \n\n\u201c \n and Leftovers: Midtown East Report\u201d advances some novel rationales against landmark designation. The Minnie Young house, which is across the street from the Stokes house, is \u201cpleasant\u201d but is \u201cnow isolated and lacks the context that would enhance its value.\u201d The Friars Club \u201cwas designed by an architect of minor interest,\u201d but because the air rights have been sold, is \u201cunlikely to be redeveloped regardless of whether or not it is landmarked.\u201d         \n\nOther possible designations are questioned because of new windows, routine repairs or even because the original materials are \u201cno longer available.\u201d Many existing landmarks could not pass that test.         \n\nThe Stokes, Young and Erdmann mansions are in a section of the report called \u201cLeftovers and Anomalies,\u201d which they, and a surviving handful of town houses, certainly are. The question drawn is whether being an anomalous leftover is what makes a landmark, or what unmakes it.
