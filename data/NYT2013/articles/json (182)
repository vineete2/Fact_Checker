{"headline": "Assad Warns Israel, Claiming a Stockpile of Russian Weapons", "body": "\nBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 President Bashar al-Assad of Syria displayed a new level of defiance on Thursday, warning Israel that he could permit attacks on the Golan Heights and suggesting that he had secured plenty of weapons from Russia \u2014 possibly including an advanced missile system \u2014 as his opponents faltered politically and Hezbollah fighters infused force into his military campaign to crush the Syrian insurgency.         \n\nMr. Assad spoke in an  \n, which is owned by his ally Hezbollah, the powerful Lebanese Shiite militant group, further punctuating his message of growing confidence that he could prevail over an insurgency that is now more than two years old and has claimed more than 80,000 lives.         \n\nAsked about Russian weapons deliveries, Mr. Assad said: \u201cRussia is committed with Syria in implementing these contracts. What we agreed upon with Russia will be implemented, and part of it has been implemented over the recent period, and we are continuing to implement it.\u201d         \n\nHe was vague on whether Russia\u2019s deliveries had included a sophisticated S-300 air missile system \u2014 of particular concern to Israel because it could compromise its ability to strike Syria from the air and because those missiles can hit deep inside Israeli territory. The Israelis have said they would not abide a Syrian deployment of S-300s, suggesting they would use force to destroy them.         \n\nBefore the broadcast, Al-Manar sent out text messages that paraphrased Mr. Assad as saying Syria had already received a first shipment of the S-300 missiles.         \n\nIt was unclear why Al-Manar said before the broadcast that Mr. Assad had spoken about the missile system when it was not directly mentioned in the televised interview. Al-Manar later said it mischaracterized what Mr. Assad had said. But American and Israeli officials have been pressing Russia to defer the S-300 system delivery to Syria, and there were other indications that the paraphrased comments may have been a premature boast or bluff.         \n\nIsraeli officials and Western diplomats in the region said they did not believe such a system had yet arrived in Syria, with some saying any delivery could be at least a few weeks away. Even so, the possibility presented a new risk that the Syrian war could expand into a broader conflict.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in stormy waters indeed,\u201d said Jonathan Spyer, a senior research fellow at the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya, Israel. \u201cSomebody or other has to not do what they have openly claimed they would do. Somebody has to lose serious face, and governments don\u2019t like to lose face at the moment of serious confrontation.\u201d         \n\nMr. Assad spent considerable time in the interview to warn Israel, which attacked what it suspected were weapons caches in Syria this month that the Israelis suspected were bound for Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon.         \n\n\u201cWe will retaliate for any Israeli aggression next time,\u201d Mr. Assad said. He also suggested the possibility of renewed fighting in the Golan Heights, the disputed border area occupied by Israel, which has been largely quiet for more than 40 years.         \n\n\u201cIn fact, there is clear popular pressure to open the Golan front to resistance,\u201d Mr. Assad said. The Syrian government, he said, had received \u201cmany Arab delegations wanting to know how young people might be enrolled to come and fight Israel.\u201d         \n\nEhud Yaari, an Israel-based fellow of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said Mr. Assad\u2019s comments on the Golan were worrisome in the context of other recent statements from Syria, particularly its assertion that Israel had violated the 1974 agreement that has allowed for the calm along the cease-fire line.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very sensitive, explosive situation being created by the new level of rhetoric,\u201d Mr. Yaari said. \u201cYou ask yourself whether the rhetoric is not going to lead to actions at some point.\u201d         \n\nMr. Assad reiterated the Syrian government\u2019s intention to attend a United Nations peace conference on Syria, which Russia and the United States have been seeking to convene in Geneva in coming weeks despite their own differences over the conflict. But he said any agreements that might result from such a conference would have to be approved by Syrians in a referendum.         \n\nEven as Mr. Assad\u2019s interview was broadcast, fissures within the Syrian opposition widened, with rebel military commanders demanding a significant new role in the main exile organization.
