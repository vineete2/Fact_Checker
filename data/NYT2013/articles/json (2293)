{"headline": "Rise in  Sexual Assaults in Egypt Sets Off Clash Over Blame", "body": "\nCAIRO \u2014 The sheer number of women sexually abused and gang raped in a single public square had become too big to ignore. Conservative Islamists in  \n\u2019s new political elite were outraged \u2014 at the women.         \n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d said Adel Abdel Maqsoud Afifi, a police general, lawmaker and ultraconservative Islamist, \u201ca girl contributes 100 percent to her own raping when she puts herself in these conditions.\u201d         \n\nThe increase in sexual assaults over the last two years has set off a new battle over who is to blame, and the debate has become a stark and painful illustration of the convulsions racking Egypt as it tries to reinvent itself.         \n\nUnder President Hosni Mubarak, the omnipresent police kept sexual assault out of the public squares and the public eye. But since Mr. Mubarak\u2019s exit in 2011, the withdrawal of the security forces has allowed sexual assault to explode into the open, terrorizing Egyptian women.         \n\nWomen, though, have also taken advantage of another aspect of the breakdown in authority \u2014 by speaking out through the newly aggressive news media, defying social taboos to demand attention for a problem the old government often denied. At the same time, some Islamist elected officials have used their new positions to vent some of the most patriarchal impulses in Egypt\u2019s traditional culture and a deep hostility to women\u2019s participation in politics.         \n\nThe female victims, these officials declared, had invited the attacks by participating in public protests. \u201cHow do they ask the Ministry of Interior to protect a woman when she stands among men?\u201d Reda Saleh Al al-Hefnawi, a lawmaker from the  \n\u2019s political party, asked at a parliamentary meeting on the issue.         \n\nThe revolution initially promised to reopen public space to women. Men and women demonstrated together in Tahrir Square peacefully during the heady 18 days and nights that led to the ouster of Mr. Mubarak. But within minutes of his departure the threat re-emerged in a group attack on the CBS News correspondent Lara Logan. There are no official statistics on women attacked \u2014 partly because few women report offenses \u2014 but all acknowledge that the attacks have grown bolder and more violent.         \n\nBy the second anniversary of the revolution, on Jan. 25, the symbolic core of the revolution \u2014 Tahrir Square \u2014 had become a no-go zone for women, especially after dark.         \n\nDuring a demonstration that day against the new Islamist-led government, an extraordinary wave of sexual assaults \u2014 at least 18 confirmed by human rights groups, and more, according to Egypt\u2019s semiofficial National Council of Women \u2014 shocked the country, drawing public attention from President  \n and Western diplomats.         \n\nHania Moheeb, 42, a journalist, was one of the first victims to speak out about her experience that day. In a television interview, she recounted how a group of men had surrounded her, stripped off her clothes and violated her for three quarters of an hour. The men all shouted that they were trying to rescue her, Ms. Moheeb recalled, and by the time an ambulance arrived she could no longer differentiate her assailants from defenders.         \n\nTo alleviate the social stigma usually attached to sexual assault victims in Egypt\u2019s conservative culture, her husband, Dr. Sherif Al Kerdani, appeared alongside her.         \n\n\u201cMy wife did nothing wrong,\u201d Dr. Kerdani said.         \n\nIn the 18 confirmed attacks that day, six women were hospitalized, according to interviews conducted by human rights groups. One woman was stabbed in her genitals, and another required a hysterectomy.         \n\nIn the aftermath, victims of other sexual assaults around Tahrir Square over the last two years have come forward as well. \u201cWhen I see Mohamed Mahmoud Street on television from home, my hand automatically grabs my pants,\u201d Yasmine Al Baramawy said in a television interview, recalling her own attack last November.         \n\nShe and a friend were each surrounded by two separate rings of attackers, she said. Some claimed to be protecting her from others but joined in the attack. They used knives to cut most of the clothes off her body and then pinned her half-naked to the hood of a car. And they continued to torment her on a slow, hourlong drive to a nearby neighborhood, where, she said, residents finally interceded to rescue her.         \n\n\u201cThey told people I had a bomb on my abdomen to stop anybody from rescuing me,\u201d Ms. Baramawy said.         \n\nThe attacks have underscored the failure of the Morsi government, with its links to the Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s political arm, to restore social order. The comments by the president\u2019s Islamist allies blaming the women have proved embarrassing.         \n\nPakinam el-Sharkawy, the president\u2019s political adviser and the highest-ranking woman in his administration, called such statements \u201ccompletely unacceptable.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/26/world/middleeast/egyptian-women-blamed-for-sexual-assaults.html", "date": "2013-03-25", "description": "Women have begun turning to the news media to tell their stories as conservative lawmakers use their political platforms to criticize victims of rape."}
