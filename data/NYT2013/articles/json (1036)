{"headline": "Going Out With Building Boom, Mayor Pushes Billions in Projects", "body": "\nThe Bloomberg administration has been pushing through more than $12 billion worth of real estate projects in its waning days, trying to solidify the mayor\u2019s claim to having transformed the face of New York City and lock in plans before Bill de Blasio takes over Jan. 1.         \n\nThe gusher of projects recently approved or on track for approval in Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s final days include an  \n and a giant observation wheel on Staten Island, totaling $580 million, and a relatively modest $16 million building in Manhattan with 55 experimental micro-apartments, as well as a $2 billion residential complex on the Brooklyn waterfront and the country\u2019s largest indoor skating complex, to be built in the Bronx.         \n\nMr. Bloomberg has sought to remake the city\u2019s landscape for the 21st century, pushing for higher-density development and higher-quality design and opening up the city\u2019s vast waterfront to new residential, recreational and commercial uses. Nearly 40 percent of the city has been rezoned during the mayor\u2019s 12 years in office.         \n\nThe man spearheading the efforts, the deputy mayor Robert K. Steel, and other officials have made it clear to the City Council, as well as to the real estate and construction industries, that they are determined to finish public reviews for a number of \u201clegacy projects\u201d before Mr. Bloomberg leaves office.         \n\nThe projects, which will begin construction well after Mayor-elect de Blasio takes office in January, also bind the new mayor to the old mayor\u2019s agenda, at least for a while. By Dec. 31, some projects, like a $1.2 billion Hudson Yards office tower and a $1.7 billion Hunter College and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center complex, will have reached the point that they cannot be stopped or modified.         \n\nOthers, like a soccer stadium in the Bronx, a Coney Island amphitheater and a residential complex at the former  \n in Brooklyn, could still be halted or changed. The Domino project has won widespread support, but Mr. de Blasio has expressed \u201cserious concerns\u201d about a proposed $350 million soccer stadium near Yankee Stadium because the Bloomberg administration planned to provide the soccer team\u2019s wealthy owners with public resources, including tax exemptions.         \n\nThe Bloomberg administration has also granted tax breaks worth tens of millions of dollars for the first phase of the $3 billion Willets Point project in Queens, for a proposed office tower on the West Side of Manhattan and for the outlet mall on Staten Island.         \n\n\u201cThey made no secret about the fact that they\u2019re working very hard to lock in a number of major projects for the future,\u201d said Brad Lander, a councilman from Brooklyn. \u201cDe Blasio said everything will be reviewed. But some things can be reviewed and changed more than others.\u201d         \n\nFor his part, Mr. de Blasio, who was the city\u2019s public advocate before being elected mayor, opposed few projects during the Bloomberg era and embraced the notion of high-density development near transit centers. But he has made it clear that he will drive a harder bargain with developers to get the best deal for taxpayers. During his mayoral campaign, Mr. de Blasio also vowed \u201cwholesale reform of our city\u2019s tax incentive policies that give hundreds of millions of dollars to office towers on Park Avenue and unaccountable one-shot subsidies to companies who can do without them.\u201d         \n\nReal estate developers and investors, who had a familiar ally in Mr. Bloomberg, will be watching for early signs of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s agenda. A spokeswoman for Mr. de Blasio, Lis Smith, said he would \u201creview every project with an eye toward maximizing affordable housing, good jobs and value for taxpayers.\u201d         \n\nOnly one so-called legacy project \u2014 the rezoning of 73 blocks surrounding Grand Central Terminal for taller towers \u2014  \n, when the Bloomberg administration could not win the Council\u2019s support last month.         \n\nEven though the Council approved the Willets Point proposal to build a retail mall and housing next to Citi Field in Queens, the project still has critics, and Mr. de Blasio could make it difficult for developments like Willets Point by slowing approval of construction permits or delaying the use of government funds.         \n\nThe Bloomberg administration has also pushed many small initiatives that critics contend should have been left for the next administration. The city recently solicited bids from private developers for a commercial complex within the Bedford Union Armory in Brooklyn, committed $51.5 million in public funds to the restoration of the  \n, which has been largely vacant for decades, and directed $50 million to a cultural center at Hudson Yards that has yet to be designed.
