The two agreed to accelerate talks aimed at defusing the dispute over Iran\u2019s nuclear program and afterward expressed optimism at the prospect of a rapprochement that would transform the Middle East.         \n\n\u201cResolving this issue, obviously, could also serve as a major step forward in a new relationship between the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran, one based on mutual interests and mutual respect,\u201d Mr. Obama, referring to Tehran\u2019s nuclear program, told reporters at the White House after the 15-minute phone call. \u201cIt would also help facilitate a better relationship between Iran and the international community, as well as others in the region.\u201d         \n\n \n in Mr. Rouhani\u2019s name later stated, \u201cIn regards to nuclear issue, with political will, there is a way to rapidly solve the matter.\u201d The account added that Mr. Rouhani had told Mr. Obama, \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful about what we will see from\u201d the United States and other major powers \u201cin coming weeks and months.\u201d         \n\nThe conversation was the first between Iranian and American leaders since 1979 when President Jimmy Carter spoke by telephone with Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi shortly before the shah left the country, according to Iran experts. The Islamic Revolution that toppled the shah\u2019s government led to the seizure of the American Embassy and a 444-day hostage crisis that have left the two countries at odds with each other ever since.         \n\nAlthough both Republican and Democratic presidents have reached out to Tehran in the interim, contact had been reserved to letters or lower-level officials.         \n\nThe call came just days after Mr. Obama had hoped to encounter Mr. Rouhani at a luncheon at the United Nations and expected to shake hands. Mr. Rouhani skipped the luncheon and later indicated it was premature to meet Mr. Obama. But a meeting on Thursday between Secretary of State John Kerry and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif of Iran was described as constructive and led Iranian officials to contact the White House on Friday to suggest the phone call, according to American officials.         \n\nA senior Obama administration official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity because of diplomatic sensitivities, said the White House had expressed the president\u2019s interest in meeting Mr. Rouhani to the Iranians this week but was surprised when they suggested the phone call. Mr. Obama placed the call from the Oval Office around 2:30 p.m., joined by aides and a translator.         \n\nHe opened by congratulating Mr. Rouhani on his election in June and noted the history of mistrust between the two nations, but also what he called the constructive statements Mr. Rouhani had made during his stay in New York, according to the official. The bulk of the call focused on the nuclear dispute, and Mr. Obama repeated that he respected Iran\u2019s right to develop civilian nuclear energy, but insisted on concessions to prevent development of weapons.         \n\nMr. Obama also raised the cases of three Americans in Iran, one missing and two others detained. In a lighter moment, he apologized for New York traffic.         \n\nThe call ended on a polite note, according to the official and Mr. Rouhani\u2019s Twitter account.         \n\n\u201cHave a nice day,\u201d Mr. Rouhani said in English.         \n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Mr. Obama replied, and then tried a Persian farewell. \u201cKhodahafez.\u201d         \n\nBy talking on the phone instead of in person, Mr. Rouhani avoided a politically problematic photo of himself with Mr. Obama, which could have inflamed hard-liners in Iran who were already wary of his outreach to the United States. As it was, conservative elements in Tehran tried to reinterpret his statements acknowledging the Holocaust while he was in New York.
