{"headline": "Obama Invokes Newtown Dead in Pressing for New Gun Laws", "body": "\nHARTFORD \u2014  \n came here on Monday before a roaring, enthusiastic crowd to remember the tragedy of 20 children and 6 educators slain at Sandy Hook Elementary School and put new pressure on a recalcitrant Congress to honor them with gun-control legislation.         \n\nIn an impassioned  \n that at times took on the tone of a campaign rally, Mr. Obama told an audience of 3,100 at the University of Hartford that he came to Connecticut to ensure that the deaths in the school in Newtown would not recede and to remind Americans how important their voice is as the gun debates unfold.         \n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re an American who wants to do something to prevent more families from knowing the immeasurable anguish that these families here have known, then we have to act,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cNow\u2019s the time to get engaged. Now\u2019s the time to get involved. Now\u2019s the time to push back on fear and frustration and misinformation. Now\u2019s the time for everybody to make their voices heard, from every statehouse to the corridors of Congress.\u201d         \n\nBut as Mr. Obama spoke, Republicans on Capitol Hill were threatening to prevent a gun-control measure from even coming up for debate.         \n\nSenator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, announced Monday that he would join at least 13 other Republicans who have vowed to block consideration of gun legislation passed by the Senate Judiciary Committee and assembled by the Democratic leadership. That effectively made the threatened  \n a test of Republican unity.         \n\nMr. McConnell made his announcement as the Senate returned from recess and the legislative struggle over new gun safety legislation entered a critical phase. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, took steps to force a vote to start a broad review of gun-control proposals and accused those threatening a filibuster of \u201cblatant obstruction,\u201d even as they showed no signs of backing down.         \n\n\u201cShame on them,\u201d said Mr. Reid, a Democrat.         \n\nMr. Obama spoke in Hartford less than a week after the Connecticut General Assembly passed a sweeping package of gun and mental health legislation with bipartisan support.         \n\nThe president was introduced by Nicole Hockley, whose first-grade son, Dylan, was killed at Sandy Hook. She recalled her life with her two sons before the tragedy and said she no longer had the option of turning away from the effects of gun violence. She said she was convinced that she and others had approached Connecticut lawmakers with the \u201clove and logic\u201d that persuaded them to pass the bill. She believed that approach could work with Congress, she said.         \n\n\u201cIf you want to protect your children, if you want to avoid this loss, you will not turn away either,\u201d Ms. Hockley said. \u201cDo something before our tragedy becomes your tragedy.\u201d         \n\nMr. Obama, who last visited Connecticut for a raw and emotional memorial shortly after the Dec. 14 shootings in Newtown, met again with the victims\u2019 relatives before his speech. Afterward about a dozen family members left with him from Connecticut on  \n to make their case in Washington to members of Congress this week.         \n\nMr. Obama, who was wearing a green Newtown bracelet, made reference in his speech to the brutal cases of recent mass violence from Aurora, Colo., to Virginia Tech. He pushed for a broad agenda that would include universal background checks for gun buyers, restraints on gun trafficking and a ban on assault weapons. But he focused on the background checks, which he said were supported by 90 percent of Americans. \u201cThere\u2019s only one thing that can stand in the way of change that just about everybody agrees on, and that\u2019s politics in Washington,\u201d he said.         \n\nMr. Obama, who included remarks respectful of gun owners, said \u201ccommon-sense\u201d gun measures could be enacted that would acknowledge the rights of gun owners and the Second Amendment. But he said that at the very least, Newtown and similar tragedies demanded a vote in Congress on gun control issues.         \n\n\u201cIf our democracy\u2019s working the way it\u2019s supposed to and 90 percent of the American people agree on something, in the wake of a tragedy, you\u2019d think this would not be a heavy lift,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cAnd yet some folks back in Washington are already floating the idea that they may use political stunts to prevent votes on any of these reforms. Think about that.         \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not just saying they\u2019ll vote no on ideas that almost all Americans support,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re saying they\u2019ll do everything they can to even prevent any votes on these provisions. They\u2019re saying your opinion doesn\u2019t matter, and that\u2019s not right.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/09/us/politics/obama-in-connecticut-to-push-for-gun-control.html", "date": "2013-04-08", "description": "As President Obama gave an impassioned speech in Connecticut, Republicans on Capitol Hill were threatening to prevent a gun-control measure from even coming up for debate."}
