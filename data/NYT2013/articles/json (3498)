{"headline": "How Come Martin Brodeur Is Still So Good?", "body": "\nThe best hockey player in the New York area right now is also one of the greatest hockey players ever, and he\u2019s a Methuselah, a 40-year-old in a sport where pro careers typically last five or six years. Martin Brodeur, now in his 20th season with the New Jersey Devils, has played so well for so long that even hockey people have tended to take him a little for granted. He\u2019s hardly an unknown, but he would be more fussed over and wondered at if he didn\u2019t play in Newark and if his position were not the lowly, unglamorous one of goalie.         \n\n\u201cPlaying goal is not fun,\u201d Ken Dryden, the Hall of Fame goalie for the Montreal Canadiens, wrote in a memoir. \u201cIt is a grim, humorless position, largely uncreative, requiring little physical movement, giving little physical pleasure in return.\u201d While his teammates zip around, the goalie lumbers, weighed down by his cumbrous equipment, and he spends the whole game by himself, down at one end of the rink, within easy earshot of heckling fans, in front of a red light that flashes on whenever he fails and lets a goal slip by. He has flurries of activity, but a lot of the time he just watches and worries. There\u2019s very little he can do to win a game, and mostly he hopes only not to lose it.         \n\nIn hockey mythology, it\u2019s an article of faith that all goalies are a little flaky. You have to be a bit nuts, the theory goes, to want to play the position in the first place \u2014 to stand in front of the net while people sling hard rubber discs at you at more than 100 miles an hour \u2014 and only certain personality types can withstand the strain. The annals of the game are full of memorable head cases. Glenn Hall, a goalie during the \u201950s and \u201960s for the Red Wings and the Blackhawks, used to throw up before every game. Gary Smith, a goalie from the same era, insisted on removing all his gear and taking a shower between periods.         \n\nThe loopiest goalie of all was Gilles Gratton, who bounced around in the minors in the \u201970s before ending his career with the St. Louis Blues and the New York Rangers. Gratton liked to skate in the nude sometimes, wearing just his goalie mask, and refused to play if the stars did not line up properly. He believed that in a previous life he was an executioner who stoned people to death, and that he was fated to become a goalie \u2014 someone on the receiving end of a stoning, so to speak \u2014 as punishment.         \n\nBrodeur, who has been the Devils\u2019 starting goalie since 1993, the backbone of the team\u2019s three successful Stanley Cup campaigns, is the exception to this tradition of brooding and eccentricity. He\u2019s probably the most well adjusted, happiest-seeming person I have ever met, so normal that it\u2019s a little eerie. Jokey and gregarious, he doesn\u2019t even mind talking to the media, though like a lot of hockey players he speaks to the press in breathless run-on sentences, like someone dashing across thin ice, fearful that if he stops, he\u2019ll fall through.         \n\nChico Resch, the former Devils goalie who is now a broadcaster for the team, cautioned me last summer about taking Brodeur at face value. \u201cThere\u2019s more to Marty than meets the eye,\u201d he said \u2014 meaning his competitiveness, I think. And Brodeur admitted that he\u2019s not always as unruffled as he seems. \u201cYou come in from a bad period and start breaking the sticks \u2014 I\u2019m not going to say it never happened,\u201d he told me, smiling. \u201cI know there is a lot of pressure on a goalie, a lot of responsibilities, but if you add on to yourself more than you need to, it makes it harder to deal with the adversity.\u201d Hockey people say that Brodeur\u2019s particular strength is his ability to bounce back from a bad goal or a bad game and not let it gnaw at him. Hockey was locked out for the first half of this season, and during the Devils\u2019 truncated training camp last month, you could see that he hates to be scored on even in practice, rapping his stick or ducking his head in disgust after letting one in. But the cloud passes in an instant, and then he\u2019s bouncing on his skates and looking for more pucks to swat away. Lou Lamoriello, the Devils\u2019 general manager, says, \u201cMarty\u2019s mental toughness, his ability to overcome a bad game, is just phenomenal.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/magazine/how-come-martin-brodeur-is-still-so-good.html", "date": "2013-02-21", "description": "One of the greatest hockey players ever is 40 years old and playing in Newark."}
