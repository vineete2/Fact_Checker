{"headline": "Restyled as Real Estate Trusts, Varied Businesses Avoid Taxes", "body": "\nA small but growing number of American corporations, operating in businesses as diverse as private prisons, billboards and casinos, are making an aggressive move to reduce \u2014 or even eliminate \u2014 their federal tax bills.         \n\nThey are declaring that they are not ordinary corporations at all. Instead, they say, they are something else: special trusts that are typically exempt from paying federal taxes.         \n\nThe trust structure has been around for years but, until recently, it was generally used only by funds holding real estate. Now, the likes of the  \n, which owns and operates 44 prisons and detention centers across the nation, have quietly received permission from the  \n to put on new corporate clothes and, as a result, save many millions on taxes.         \n\nThe Corrections Corporation, which is making the switch, expects to save $70 million in 2013.  \n, which operates 22 casinos, including the M Resort Spa Casino in Las Vegas, recently won approval to change its tax designation, too.         \n\nChanging from a standard corporation to a real estate investment trust, or REIT \u2014 a designation signed into law by President Dwight D. Eisenhower \u2014 has suddenly become a hot corporate trend. One Wall Street analyst has characterized the label as a \u201cgolden ticket\u201d for corporations.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in this business for 30 years, and I\u2019ve never seen the interest in REIT conversions as high as it is today,\u201d said Robert O\u2019Brien, the head of the real estate practice at Deloitte & Touche, the big accounting firm.         \n\nAt a time when deficits and taxes loom large in Washington, some question whether the new real estate investment trusts deserve their privileged position.         \n\nWhen they were created in 1960, they were meant to be passive investment vehicles, like mutual funds, that buy up a broad portfolio of real estate \u2014 whether shopping malls, warehouses, hospitals or even timberland \u2014 and derive almost all of their income from those holdings.         \n\nOne of the bedrock principles \u2014 and the reason for the tax exemption \u2014 was that the trusts do not do any business other than owning real estate.         \n\nBut bit by bit, especially in recent years, that has changed as the I.R.S., in a number of low-profile decisions, has broadened the definition of real estate, and allowed companies to split off parts of their business that are unrelated to real estate.         \n\nFor example, prison companies like the Corrections Corporation and the Geo Group successfully argued that the money they collect from governments for holding prisoners is essentially rent. Companies that operate cellphone towers have said that the towers themselves are real estate.         \n\nThe conversions generally do not require the companies to change their underlying business. The chief executive of the Corrections Corporation, Damon T. Hininger, told investors in February that the new structure should help in the company\u2019s aim of \u201chousing more and more population for federal, state and local levels as they grow or deal with overcrowding.\u201d         \n\nThe I.R.S. released  \n, allowing a data and document storage company to convert, on April 5. The letter did not include the name of the company, but several data storage companies, including Iron Mountain and Equinix, are in the process of converting.         \n\nA few days later, a strategist at the Wall Street firm Jefferies wrote  \n: \u201cIt is not a far stretch to envision REITs concentrated in railroads, highways, mines, landfills, vineyards, farmland or any other \u2018immovable\u2019 structure that generates revenues.\u201d         \n\nToday, there are more than 1,000 real estate investment trusts, about 10 percent of them traded publicly on the stock market. Investors like them because, by law, they must distribute at least 90 percent of their taxable income to their shareholders \u2014 a particularly alluring prospect today, given the low interest rates paid by many other basic investments.         \n\nThe benefits of converting are obvious for stockholders and corporate insiders as well. The conversion typically drives up a company\u2019s stock price. Investors are drawn by the prospect of lucrative dividends under the new structure. The mere rumor that a company might convert has been enough to send its stock price soaring.         \n\nThe trend has been a concern to advocates of the traditional trusts, who fear that the newcomers may eventually jeopardize the tax status of older funds that do not do any business other than owning real estate.
