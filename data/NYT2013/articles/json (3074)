{"headline": "Knicks\u2019 Illusion Was Convincing, but Magic May Run Out", "body": "\nINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 The gap between expectations and reality stung hard, leaving  \n to split the difference Saturday night in his final postgame soliloquy of the season.         \n\nSitting on the dais at Bankers Life Fieldhouse, where his  \n had been vanquished by the Indiana Pacers, Anthony leaned into the microphone, his expression pained, his words hopeful.         \n\n\u201cOver all, we had a hell of a season, hell of a year,\u201d Anthony said, adding, \u201cTo get to this point right now, where we had a chance to get to a conference finals, we\u2019ll take that.\u201d         \n\nIt was a mixed message, ripe for overinterpretation. Where some observers heard optimism, others heard a tacit acceptance of failure after the Knicks fell short of their goals.         \n\nThe Knicks did not set out this season merely to improve or to win a single playoff series. They set out to challenge the Miami Heat\u2019s supremacy \u2014 a quest cut short by a Pacers team that was younger and tougher, less glamorous but more polished and determined.         \n\nBeat the Heat? The Knicks never even earned the chance to meet the Heat in the games that matter most.         \n\nAnthony is right to accentuate the positive, having delivered a 54-victory season, an Atlantic Division title and the franchise\u2019s first playoff series victory in 13 years. But so much more was expected of a team stocked with high-priced talent and distinguished veterans.         \n\nThe Knicks decorated their lockers with Larry O\u2019Brien Trophy decals, crowed when they routed the Heat twice and harrumphed when anyone suggested that the road to the title still went through Miami.         \n\nTheir bravado often outpaced their play, especially in the middle of the season, when the Knicks played at a .500 level for 40 games. From a team based in New York, the bravado and star power only inflated expectations: if the Knicks look and act like championship contenders, then they must be championship contenders.         \n\nThat thinking was as flawed as the roster itself, a hard truth that the front office must confront once again, now that the illusory title chase is over.         \n\nFor better or worse, the Knicks are defined by Anthony, a splendid scorer who has not learned to expand his game or to consistently involve teammates. After being rightly praised for a more team-oriented approach in the regular season, Anthony regressed in the playoffs, taking a career-high 25.8 shots a game and converting just 40.6 percent.         \n\nAt their best this season, the Knicks were a well-orchestrated, ball-moving, 3-point-shooting offensive juggernaut. That worked well as long as Anthony and J. R. Smith were participating in the ball movement part, and not so well when they reverted to predictable isolation play.         \n\nThe Knicks can win with Anthony, but they have to surround him with playmakers to offset his ball-dominating ways and find him a suitable co-star.         \n\nAmar\u2019e Stoudemire was supposed to fill that role, but his game and Anthony\u2019s have never meshed, and now Stoudemire\u2019s health is betraying him. He played 29 regular-season games between knee operations and sparingly in the playoffs.         \n\nThe idea that Anthony and Stoudemire might approximate the harmonious partnership of LeBron James and Dwyane Wade has never seemed more outlandish.         \n\nStoudemire could still be useful as a second-unit scorer, but it is hard to envision him back in a starting role. Anthony thrived this season at power forward, Stoudemire\u2019s position, and the Knicks had their most success when Stoudemire was out, going 21-9 to start the season and 21-5 after his second knee operation.         \n\nTeam officials will surely shop Stoudemire again, as  \n for two seasons, but his suspect knees and his contract \u2014 which has two years and $46.8 million remaining \u2014 make him virtually impossible to trade.         \n\nSmith briefly auditioned for the co-star\u2019s role, even winning sixth man of the year honors while earning praise \u2014 clearly premature \u2014 for his apparent maturation. Then came the playoffs, and he reverted to old, bad habits, on and off the court. He will be remembered for poor play and poor judgment this postseason, for elbowing Boston\u2019s Jason Terry and for clubbing with Rihanna.         \n\nIt is the most twisted of silver linings that Smith\u2019s erratic spring will probably help the Knicks keep him this summer. No team is going to overbid for him now.         \n\nThat still leaves the Knicks with a talent deficit and a payroll with no flexibility. Anthony, Stoudemire and Tyson Chandler are due $58.2 million next season \u2014 the equivalent of this season\u2019s salary cap \u2014 and the Knicks are committed to at least six others who will push the payroll well into luxury-tax territory if Smith stays. That means the Knicks cannot acquire players through sign-and-trade deals and will be limited only to cap exceptions.         \n\nThey cannot count on much growth from within. Iman Shumpert, who turns 23 next month, is the only rotation player younger than 29.         \n\nThe Knicks are paying the price for their obsessive pursuit of aging veterans last summer. Rasheed Wallace and Kurt Thomas did not last the season. Marcus Camby barely played but is guaranteed $4.4 million next season. Jason Kidd was invaluable in the locker room and for a time on the court, but he faded badly in the playoffs and is owed $3.1 million in each of the next two seasons, unless he retires.         \n\nWhat the Knicks called the three-year plan \u2014 acquiring older players to complement Anthony, Stoudemire and Chandler until their contracts expire \u2014 turned out to be a one-year plan. They now need a new plan and new players.         \n\nIn the final analysis, the problem is not that the Knicks got so close to their goal and failed. It\u2019s the illusion that they were ever close at all.
