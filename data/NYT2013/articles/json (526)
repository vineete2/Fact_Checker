{"headline": "Open-Air Bars Serving Summer Cocktails in Manhattan", "body": "\nTHE question isn\u2019t whether you can get a drink up on the roof; there are plenty of places in Manhattan for that every summer.         \n\nThe challenge is finding a place to have a warm-weather cocktail or a quality beer, talk for a bit and take in a view that is more expansive than a skyline composed of vodka and bourbon bottles.         \n\nYou want a quiet drink, but one amended for summer. That means some moderate noise \u2014 from the traffic, from a sound system, from the happy chatter of a crowd. You will probably drink out of a plastic cup. You will pay more than you expected for that drink in a plastic cup, but it is summer, after all, and you are outside. You will hear a song by Carly Rae Jepsen that may not be \u201cCall Me Maybe\u201d but could well be \u201cThis Kiss\u201d \u2014 and you will go with it.         \n\nThe goal is always to do all of those things at a rooftop bar that seems happy to have you as a guest. Here, five Manhattan bars that fit the description.         \n\n \n         \n\nThe rooftop at the Hotel Metro has a casual, vacation vibe and a fantastic view of the  \n, Macy\u2019s at Herald Square and the Herald Towers at 34th Street and Broadway. (Jackie Robinson lived there when it was the Hotel McAlpin.)         \n\nIt also grows its own jalape\u00f1os for a spicy margarita, which is not your everyday Manhattan agrarian occurrence.         \n\nThe Roof Terrace is not fancy. You pass the hotel\u2019s compact fitness center on the way in, and the cups are, yes, plastic, but it is low-key fun. Red awnings cover some of the seating areas and the bar. The music is pop \u2014 Katy Perry, Enrique Iglesias, Pink \u2014 played at medium volume. Fashion runs from guys in sport coats to a guy in an Iron Maiden T-shirt (the far better choice on a steamy night in late June). There always seems to be something of a breeze on this 14th-floor space, and it is a comfortable place to kick back while appreciating a memorable perspective.         \n\nThe drinks, fittingly enough, tend toward the resort-y: a pi\u00f1a colada, an apple martini and a decent, weather forecast-appropriate Dark and Stormy, made with Gosling\u2019s dark rum and Saranac ginger beer. (Most specialty drinks are $15.) Beers on tap include Brooklyn Lager, Blue Point Summer Ale and Harpoon I.P.A. (all $8).         \n\nThere were no homegrown jalape\u00f1os to be found on a recent visit, but a margarita with Patron tequila ($16) worked out O.K.         \n\n \n         \n\nThe rooftop bar at the Metropolitan Museum of Art was the second in a week at which a customer was wearing an Iron Maiden T-shirt (it was definitely not the same guy who was at the Hotel Metro\u2019s terrace), which just goes to show that every now and then a headbanger has to take a break from listening to \u201cEl Dorado.\u201d (Although it should be noted that you can see the El Dorado apartment building on the Upper West Side from here.)         \n\nThis being the Met, there is art. The current installation, which has the terrace painted in red-and-white patterns, is by Imran Qureshi, and previous summers have showcased work by Tomas Saraceno and Anthony Caro.         \n\nThere are also some strong drinks and sweeping views of Central Park, the  \n and the famous apartment buildings on Central Park West, including the San Remo.         \n\nIt\u2019s a great place to have a drink \u2014 though the limited seating and an 8 p.m. closing time make it hard to imagine anyone\u2019s having two \u2014 and to spend some of an early evening applauding the skyline. The crowd here includes people of all ages, from a young woman in booty shorts to an older woman wearing a boot cast.         \n\nThe specialty drinks, priced at $14 and served in (am I repeating myself?) plastic cups are fine: a martini made with Svedka vodka; a rosewater cocktail made with cachaca, rosewater essence, sparkling water, sugar, lemon juice and topped with yellow rose petals; and an iced black tea made with Jim Beam bourbon,  \n and cardamom pods.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if the cardamom seeds really add anything,\u201d one of my son\u2019s friends remarked \u2014 because at a museum, everyone\u2019s a critic. (Beers, including Brooklyn Summer Ale, are $9, and Hayes Ranch wines are $12. Museum admission should be considered a cultural cover charge.)         \n\nThe exit is down a mirrored stairwell, which constitutes something of an art installation of its own.         \n\n \n         \n\nThere is an odd piece of art hanging on a wall at Rare View at the Shelburne Hotel on Lexington Avenue, a mural of a showgirl in a champagne glass surrounded by hamburgers, a green beer bottle and some skyscrapers.         \n\nIt\u2019s not going to be hanging in the Met anytime soon \u2014 it\u2019s pretty ugly \u2014 but it does seem to capture the agreeably kooky atmosphere of this 16th-floor bar.
