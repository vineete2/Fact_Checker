{"headline": "Federer Deserves Ovation Tour, but Not Just Yet", "body": "\nAt the fourth and final Grand Slam event of the tennis year, poignant goodbyes can sneak up on us, like an old friend covering our eyes from behind and saying, \u201cGuess who.\u201d         \n\nIn 1981, at 25, Bjorn Borg lost a  \n final to John McEnroe, packed his bag and never played in another major. Pete Sampras won the same tournament by defeating his career rival, Andre Agassi, in 2002 and never played another tour match. One year ago, Andy Roddick announced his pending retirement during the first week of the tournament and was gone days later.         \n\nMarion Bartoli didn\u2019t even make it to New York this summer,  \n in Mason, Ohio, just weeks after her climactic career victory at Wimbledon.         \n\nThe R word no doubt still sounds profane to  \n, but I think I am speaking for most fans of the sport when I say: whenever the time does come for him to exit the stage, some serious advance notice would be appreciated.         \n\nIn the way the global tennis village said so long to Agassi, the Vegas showman, at Arthur Ashe Stadium in 2006, it will want to bid Federer \u2014 the modern standard-bearer for graceful, artistic tennis and the leader in Grand Slam men\u2019s singles titles (17) \u2014 a sincere and appropriate farewell.         \n\nEven as Federer, 32, has  \n from a surprising No. 1 at this time last year to a current No. 7, nobody really wants to broach the subject of his departure from the sport. For one thing, he has consistently made it clear that he hopes to play for several more years. For another, nobody who appreciates greatness wants to see him go.         \n\nFinally \u2014 and perhaps most persuasively \u2014 he tends to become defensive and prickly when questioned about the view beyond the next big tournament.         \n\nCase in point: Questioned about his rankings decline recently in Ohio, and what, if anything, that meant to him, Federer snapped, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d         \n\nI tend to think there is a possibility that Federer would at least consider quitting by the end of next year. But that\u2019s only if, as expected, he rededicates himself for next season and continues to slide.         \n\nIn Ohio, Federer said he was no longer playing for the money, the lifestyle or even the pursuit of regaining the No. 1 ranking. In doing so, he invoked the R word, if only in the most general sense.         \n\n\u201cIf passion doesn\u2019t overweigh the rest, the end is extremely near,\u201d he said.         \n\nBut he added: \u201cAnd for me, there\u2019s no question about that \u2014 my passion is sky high. That\u2019s why I\u2019m still doing it. I love what I\u2019m doing.\u201d         \n\nEven assuming he is past his recent back issues, what happens to the passion when one so accustomed to playing deep into major events begins to be sent off much sooner? The lower Federer drops in the rankings, the more difficult the draw and the greater the chance of losing during the first week \u2014  \n this summer.         \n\n\u201cIf he is going to be No. 9 in the world, or 11, is he going to be around? That\u2019s the question,\u201d said Jimmy Arias, a broadcaster and a former top 10 player. \u201cThat one no one will know but him. But great players like him always believe they\u2019ll get it back.\u201d         \n\nLast month, Federer briefly tried a larger racket head, which some had been urging him to do. Not Sampras, though.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he needs to panic and feel he needs to change everything,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s still a great player.\u201d         \n\nGranted, Sampras might have formulated this take based on his storybook ending after many had counted him out.         \n\nConversely, John McEnroe\u2019s decline in the mid-to-late 1980s was irreversible, and he, like Federer, played in his prime with a sprinkling of magic dust. McEnroe, the realist, countered Sampras by saying, \u201cObviously, Roger just turned 32, and it\u2019s not going to get any easier.\u201d         \n\nTo the expert eye, Federer\u2019s seeming decline has to do with age, as well as stiffening competition.         \n\n\u201cTo me, the reason he\u2019s dropped off a little bit \u2014 and I noticed it in the Australian Open this year after one match \u2014 is that he\u2019s a half-step slower,\u201d Arias said. \u201cHe always had this giant recovery step; I\u2019d never seen anything like it. But you could see he wasn\u2019t on the ball every time. He needed an extra step as he moved in to it. That little margin is all it takes.\u201d         \n\nArias added: \u201cOne thing I always thought about him was that he won so easily over the years. He was just crushing guys. Now he\u2019s got to win a lot of close matches and he doesn\u2019t play the close points, for the most part, that well.\u201d         \n\nLike many Federer followers, Arias admitted he had counted him out as a top-three player once or twice and been proved wrong. As far back as 2008, when Federer, then 27, struggled through the summer but  \n his fifth consecutive title in Flushing Meadows, what was more likely a news media concern than a premature dismissal brought a mild-mannered backlash from the Swiss family.         \n\n\u201cSome of you guys were writing negatively of him, saying Federer was gone,\u201d his father, Robert, said.         \n\nOf the supposed critics, he added, \u201cFederer proved them all wrong today.\u201d         \n\nFederer, who has not won the United States Open since 2008, picked up on that theme in Ohio, saying: \u201cSometimes, the media uses what they have to make a good article for them, which makes sense, but right now for me, it is getting back playing well, going deep into tournaments, and then the ranking will follow automatically, up or down.\u201d         \n\nIt has always been difficult to read Federer, on court and off, so who knows what he is thinking. Did he make recent stops he hadn\u2019t made in years (Gstaad, Switzerland, and Hamburg, Germany) thinking he might never pass that way again? Or were they to test the new racket he soon discarded (for now)?         \n\nWhatever happens, one would hope that Federer\u2019s sunset \u2014 if that is what he is approaching, or in \u2014 will not be darkened by misinterpretation of opinion or fact. For the past decade, he has been every bit the salesman and much more the statesman for his sport that Tiger Woods has been for golf. He has been as classy an act as baseball\u2019s departing Mariano Rivera, who has been touring the country to a standing ovation in his farewell season.         \n\nPerhaps something for Federer to consider in the future \u2014 if not the near future \u2014 on a global level, come to think of it.
