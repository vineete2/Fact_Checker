People who actually watch N.H.L. playoffs tried to warn them while they climbed on and did not bother to hold on very tight. Tuesday night\u2019s  \n in Los Angeles jolted many of them right to the pavement.         \n\nPretty much everything you need to know about Tuesday night\u2019s game: when the player everyone was hailing as the difference-making defenseman, Duncan Keith, feels the need to whack Kings center Jeff Carter in the face with his stick \u2014 apparently just for the fun of it \u2014 the wheels are coming off your game:         \nDuncan Keith is sorry for high-sticking Jeff Carter \n\nPerhaps Keith was just reminding everyone how insane it is that hockey does not yet require its players to wear visors to protect their eyes from such things, although there finally was movement on that front with  \n for any player entering the league (although current players would still have a choice). But did anyone need any reminders after  \n? Really? Here are Staal\u2019s two brothers, Eric and Jordan, talking about the issue earlier this year on TSN:         \nHockey Safety - Eric and Jordan Staal - OTR - Mandatory Visors for NHL Players \n\nThe French Open produced a shocker Tuesday, with Jo-Wilfried Tsonga thrilling his home country fans with a  \n of the once great Roger Federer. Sure, there were clues that Federer would not do so well here \u2014 needing five sets to beat Gilles Simon in the last round being a big one \u2014 but still, this?         \nTsonga ELIMINATES Federer at French Open \n\nCollege sports paused Tuesday as Gordon Gee, the walking verbal pratfall serving as Ohio State\u2019s president and a constant reminder why college sports has run off the rails, announced his retirement after his latest off-the-cuff adventures. Many will miss Gee\u2019s wacky brand of candidness because he  \n, but others are thrilled to watch his act exit stage right. He was, you have to admit, an original. How many university presidents give demonstrations on tying a bow tie? (Video cameras were favorites of his, too.)         \nHow to Tie a Bowtie \n\nNot every sports highlight of the day required formal wear. In a Buffalo Bisons game, in fact, it would have been helped by a beach towel, which Manager Marty Brown might have spread out on the infield to make taking a seat there in protest a little more comfortable:         \nBuffalo Bisons Manager Marty Brown Sits On Grass After Ejection \n\nThe attire in this last video speaks for itself, and it\u2019s hard to tell which is weirder: that a mascot at a New Zealand rugby game who tackled a streaker who ran on the field was wearing a chicken suit, or that he was wearing a James Harden Houston Rockets jersey.
