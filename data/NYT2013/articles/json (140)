{"headline": "With Money at Risk, Hospitals Push Staff to Wash Hands", "body": "\nAt  \n on Long Island, motion sensors, like those used for burglar alarms, go off every time someone enters an intensive care room. The sensor triggers a video camera, which transmits its images halfway around the world to India, where workers are checking to see if doctors and nurses are performing a critical procedure:  \n.         \n\nThis Big Brother-ish approach is one of a  \n to promote a basic tenet of infection prevention, hand-washing, or as it is more clinically known in the hospital industry,  \n. With  \n, according to a recent report by the federal  \n, and with hospital-acquired infections costing $30 billion and leading to nearly 100,000 patient deaths a year, hospitals are willing to try almost anything to  \n of transmission.         \n\nStudies have shown that without encouragement, hospital workers wash their hands as little as 30 percent of the time that they interact with patients. So in addition to the video snooping, hospitals across the country are training hand-washing coaches, handing out rewards like free pizza and coffee coupons, and admonishing with \u201cred cards.\u201d They are using radio-frequency ID chips that note when a doctor has passed by a sink, and undercover monitors, who blend in with the other white coats, to watch whether their colleagues are washing their hands for the requisite 15 seconds, as long as it takes to sing the \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d song.         \n\nAll this effort is to coax workers into using more soap and water, or alcohol-based sanitizers like Purell.         \n\n\u201cThis is not a quick fix; this is a war,\u201d said Dr. Bruce Farber, chief of infectious disease at North Shore.         \n\nBut the incentive to do something is strong: under new federal rules, hospitals will lose  \n money when patients get preventable infections.         \n\nOne puzzle is why health care workers are so bad at it. Among the explanations studies have offered are complaints about dry skin, the pressures of an emergency environment, the tedium of hand washing and resistance to authority (doctors, who have the most authority, tend to be the most resistant, studies have found).         \n\n\u201cThere are still staff out there who say, \u2018How dare they!\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Elaine Larson, a professor in Columbia University\u2019s school of nursing who has made a career out of studying hand-washing.         \n\nPhilip Liang, who founded a company,  \n, that outfits hospital workers with electronic badges that track hand-washing, attributes low compliance to \u201chigh cognitive load.\u201d         \n\n\u201cNurses have to remember hundreds \u2014 thousands \u2014 of procedures,\u201d Mr. Liang said. \u201cTake out the catheter; change four medications. It\u2019s really easy to forget the basic tasks. You\u2019re really concentrating on what\u2019s difficult, not on what\u2019s simple.\u201d         \n\nHis company uses a technology similar to Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. The badge communicates with a sensor on every sanitizer and soap dispenser, and with a beacon behind the patient\u2019s bed. If the wearer\u2019s hands are not cleaned, the badge vibrates, like a cellphone, so that the health care worker is reminded but not humiliated in front of the patient.         \n\nJust waving one\u2019s hands under the dispenser is not enough. \u201cWe know if you took a swig of soap,\u201d Mr. Liang said.         \n\nThe program uses a frequent-flier model to reward workers with incentives, sometimes cash bonuses, the more they wash their hands.         \n\n \n, which manufactures the ubiquitous Purell, has also developed technology that can be snapped into any of its soap or sanitizer dispensers to track hand-hygiene.         \n\nAt North Shore, the video monitoring program, run by a company called Arrowsight, has been adapted from the meat industry, where cameras track whether workers who skin animals \u2014 the hide can contaminate the meat \u2014 wash their hands, knives and electric cutters.         \n\nAdam Aronson, the chief executive of  \n, said he was inspired to go from slaughterhouses to hospitals by his father, Dr. Mark Aronson, vice chairman for quality at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston and a professor at Harvard Medical School.         \n\n\u201cNobody would do a free test \u2014 they talked about Big Brother, patient privacy \u2014 nobody wanted to touch it,\u201d Mr. Aronson said.         \n\nHe finally got a trial at a small surgery center in Macon, Ga., and in 2008, North Shore also agreed to a trial in its intensive care unit. The medical center at the University of California, San Francisco, is also using Arrowsight\u2019s video system, and Mr. Aronson said eight more hospitals in the United States, Britain, the Netherlands and Pakistan had agreed to test the cameras.         \n\nNorth Shore\u2019s study, published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, found that during a 16-week preliminary period when workers were being filmed but were not informed of the results, hand-hygiene rates were less than 10 percent. When they started getting reports on their filmed behavior, through electronic scoreboards and e-mails, the rates rose to 88 percent. The hospital kept the system, but because of the expense, it has limited it to the intensive care unit, where the payoff is greatest because the patients are sickest.
