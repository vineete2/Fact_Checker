{"headline": "Finishes Beyond All Control in the N.F.L.", "body": "\nIn the N.F.L., teams play once a week and everyone essentially has too much time to think. It has led to a culture of excessive preparation that leaves nothing to chance.         \n\nA team\u2019s staff of 20 coaches strategizes throughout 16-hour days, the players watch endless video of opponents, and executives micromanage the roster trying to anticipate every contingency. The ethos of exactitude extends even to what happens in the desperate and frenzied final minutes of a close game.         \n\nThis is where the \u00fcberorchestrated N.F.L. routinely fails.         \n\nSome say N.F.L. stands for No Fun League. Not late in tight games and especially not in the tense postseason, when the wacky, unforeseen ending is a tradition that no amount of painstaking preparation can eradicate.         \n\nThe Music City Miracle, the Immaculate Reception, the Drive, the Fumble, the Catch and the desperation pass that inspired the nickname Hail Mary are only some of the unplanned outcomes in ever-memorable playoff shockers.         \n\nThe coming N.F.L. postseason promises more of the same because the regular season has been filled with wild finishes: New England scored two touchdowns in the final 61 seconds to defeat Cleveland; Minnesota and Baltimore scored five touchdowns in the final 2 minutes 5 seconds; and Carolina\u2019s Cam Newton outdueled the Patriots\u2019 Tom Brady in last-minute drives in a pivotal upset.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new world, baby, because everybody is just letting it fly,\u201d said Herman Edwards, a former Jets and Kansas City coach who is now an ESPN analyst. \u201cAnything can happen in the modern era because the ball is constantly in the air. Throw it that much, and you\u2019ll get unpredictability. And there\u2019s one other reason for the wild finishes: Everybody practices sophisticated trick plays.\u201d         \n\nBut that does not stop N.F.L. coaches from trying to prepare for the unexpected.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy,\u201d said Brian Billick, a  \n-winning coach with Baltimore and now an analyst for Fox Sports and the NFL Network. \u201cBut you ready yourself in practice for every possible thing you could try or that you could see, even though 90 percent of those situations will never come up.         \n\n\u201cI read once where a University of California professor ran a calculation of all the variables and permutations that can occur in the final minutes of a football game: down and distance, time left, score, yards to gain, how many timeouts remaining, which personnel to use, everything he could think of.         \n\n\u201cIt came out to like 150 million combinations. As a coach, I always felt like I covered 149 million possibilities, but it was the last million that killed me.\u201d         \n\nThey include more than hurry-up offenses and four-minute or two-minute drills. Onside kicks can be executed dozens of ways. Fake punts, and deception on kickoff returns, are options, as are reverses and throwback passes. Other tactics include icing the kicker before a potential winning or tying kick.         \n\nThe desperation pass has lost its spontaneity. What appears to be 10 players jumping like fans trying to catch a foul baseball is actually a play that is carefully diagramed and practiced, on both sides of the ball.         \n\nIn the final seconds with a game in the balance, football is serious business.         \n\n\u201cOne thing I always noticed was how quiet it got on the field at the end of tight games,\u201d said Gerry Austin, an N.F.L. referee who retired after 25 years and three Super Bowls. \u201cAll the chatter between players that you heard earlier in the game came to a sudden halt. It went silent.         \n\n\u201cThere was too much at stake. They wanted to be the one that won the game for their team, and they definitely didn\u2019t want to be the one who lost the game for their team.\u201d         \n\nA compendium of nervous, stressful end-of-game situations and outcomes follows.         \n\n \n         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a nerve-racking time, probably because of how many voices you hear in your head \u2014 real and imagined,\u201d Billick said. \u201cYou do have other coaches talking in your ear and making suggestions. You have to decide on the personnel, whether to call a timeout, when to spike the ball, what play to call. And then, by the way, you have to communicate all of that to the players in a very timely manner.
