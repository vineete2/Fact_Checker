This week we take a look at how it happens that those we were closest to can have stories about us \u2014 and what has happened between us \u2014 that are so bewilderingly different from our own. And we have three strategies that just might let the healing begin.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \nFew things are as emotionally upsetting as having a family member who has severed ties with you (or with the whole family). Most of us work especially hard  \nto cut off ties with family, precisely because they are family. And so when someone does, it is often experienced by those cut off as being cavalier, petty, or the result of a failure to try hard enough.         \n\nIn short, he or she is holding a grudge. A grudge, by definition, is a thing that should  \nbe held. It\u2019s not a legitimate or healthy reaction and the resulting choices are bad ones. A more stable person would not have taken offense in the first place and a bigger person would surely have let go of it by now.         \n\nBut that\u2019s not how it\u2019s experienced by the people holding the grudge. They know that what they are doing is protecting themselves, drawing essential boundaries, doing the only thing left to them to do. When we cut ties with others it\u2019s not because we don\u2019t care; it\u2019s because the friction or pain or dysfunction have finally overpowered even the special pull of family.         \n\nNone of this tells us whether those who withdraw from families are right or wrong, justified or not. It only says that that their reasons make sense  \n, even if they don\u2019t make sense to us.         \n\n \n         \n\nBefore thinking about what to do, it\u2019s useful to understand a few reasons why people on each side of a conflict can experience it so differently.         \n\n1.  \n Everyone gets frustrated, resentful, disappointed, or even enraged with others on occasion. It may come out as shouting, sarcasm, snippiness, or simply a put-upon silence. In those moments, we don\u2019t see our emotional behavior as a big deal. They\u2019re the ones who were being unusually annoying, it was a tense situation, you were tired. You know that your anger in that moment is not who you \u201creally are.\u201d         \n\nBut to the other person, your anger is  \n who you are. Your emotional display is not incidental \u2013 it\u2019s at the heart of the story they tell of what happened between you. From their point of view, your anger \n the threat \u2013 the very thing they were coping with in that moment.         \n\nSo you will tend to subtract your own emotions from the story, while the other person counts your emotions, say, double. And the same is true in reverse: You count their emotional reactions double, while they subtract them.         \n\n2.  \n Now factor in that memories that have emotions involved have a big red tag on them, so that we locate and recall those memories easily, even years later (and even when we would rather not recall them). This is why a sister remembers something that happened in childhood as a central moment in a conflict with her brother, while the brother literally has no memory of the event. If it had little emotional resonance for him at the time, he didn\u2019t tag it. And so it didn\u2019t \u201cstick.\u201d         \n\nFurthermore, there is evidence that each time we recall a memory, or retell it, we overwrite the memory itself. We think we still have the master file \u2014 that we remember exactly what happened accurately \u2014 but in fact we\u2019re on version seven (or 77). And so is the other person. Over time each of our stories about what really happened grow farther and farther apart.         \n\nSimply recalling (your version of) an upsetting incident between you and a sibling \u2014 or experiencing the same kind of behavior from them now \u2014 can retrigger those feelings of hurt, confusion, disappointment, betrayal, or fear all over again. The original events were long ago \u2014 10 or even 40 years past. But the feelings are happening (again) now.         \n\nTaken together, emotional math and emotional memories partly explain why our family stories of past and present can be so disturbingly different, or even why we have no idea what their grudge-holding story might be.         \n\n \n         \n\nDon\u2019t write them a long letter or email explaining your perspective. Even if you do a beautiful and skillful job of it, even if you apologize, it is unlikely to achieve your purposes. Why? Because inevitably some aspect of what you describe will feel \u201coff\u201d to them (\u201cThat\u2019s not what happened!\u201d) or will leave out parts that they feel are most important. And their interpretation of your motives for writing the letter is colored by emotion. Your desire to reconnect is seen as a desire to absolve yourself of guilt, to manipulate, or to appear to be righteously taking the high road.
