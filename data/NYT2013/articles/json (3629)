{"headline": "A Solid, Comforting Family Member", "body": "\nThe last time I saw my family\u2019s Nakashima dining table, it was upended on a dusty Dodge Ram, a gray blanket wrapped around it. The ropes that tied the bundle to the van\u2019s roof didn\u2019t seem up to the task of keeping the precious cargo from slipping off and crashing on the road somewhere         \n\nbetween my mother\u2019s town house in Pennsylvania and the warehouse of the dealer in New York who had just purchased it.         \n\nMy mother had recently died, my father had passed away years earlier, and my three sisters and I had just sold the table. But I was having issues separating from the piece that my parents, in a burst of optimism, had commissioned more than four decades before.         \n\nIt was the spring of 1967. They were young and adventurous, two Brooklyn-born, Syracuse-educated liberals who had moved into a 1920s house on the outskirts of Philadelphia because my father, an industrial designer, had a job nearby. But my parents never really fit the suburban mold. They steered our red-and-white VW minibus to art galleries and folk concerts, and Sunday mornings my siblings and I raked leaves while our neighborhood pals went to church in patent-leather Mary Janes.         \n\nAt some point my parents heard about George Nakashima, a Japanese-American architect who had been interned during World War II and had set up a studio in New Hope, Pa., where he made furniture that celebrated the natural beauty of wood. They made a pilgrimage to ask him to build us a table.         \n\nWith Mr. Nakashima, they picked out a vividly grained piece of American walnut from the raw slabs of wood lined up in his workshop like giant pieces of toast. They watched as he sketched out a table whose top would consist of two book-matched planks with undulating edges, the pieces held together with three rosewood butterfly joints.         \n\nMy parents would keep the six-by-eight-inch scrap of paper in their safe deposit box. The table itself \u2014 once Mr. Nakashima had completed it and my parents had paid him $550, an extravagant sum for them at the time \u2014 became the centerpiece of our home.         \n\nOther houses in the neighborhood tended toward Lemon Pledged colonial reproductions. But our table went with our Hans Wegner lounge chair and ebony African figurines; architectural etchings by my father\u2019s father, a W.P.A. artist; and Kathe Kollwitz\u2019s lithograph of the 16th-century German peasant uprising, spears raised in the air. As a child, I envied the nondescript d\u00e9cor (and cushy chairs) of my friends\u2019 homes. But I now realize that my parents\u2019 design choices were their way of carving out an alternative universe in a place they didn\u2019t quite belong.         \n\nBoth were Jewish, neither religious. If my father worshiped anyone, it was Mr. Nakashima \u2014 never referred to in our house as George, as dealers do today. And he cared for our table in a way that seemed like a ritual of devotion. Periodically, he would remove the woven place mats that protected it from mealtime spatters, tipping a tall cylindrical container of oil onto it. Then, with a clean rag, he would anoint the wood, sweeping his arm back and forth. The table, still so natural looking, still so much a tree, drank it up like a living thing.         \n\nIt was at this table that we gathered to eat all our meals and slice into birthday cakes. It was at this table that my father pounded his fist in frustration with a career that he ultimately found unfulfilling and a marriage that was coming apart.         \n\nAnd it was at this table, in the town house my mother moved to after the divorce and the sale of the family home, that my sisters and I gathered to regroup after her death. Here we mourned, planned her memorial, sorted through her finances and discussed what to do with her possessions.         \n\nThere was an abundance of art and Danish Modern furniture, once again trendy. And there were a number of pieces by Nakashima, whose work had gained widespread recognition with an American Craft Museum retrospective in 1989, a year before his death. My mother had acquired four Nakashima chairs to go around the table, plus a Nakashima bench, ottoman and rocker, all of which she had saved for out of her schoolteacher\u2019s salary.
