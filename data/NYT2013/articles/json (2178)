{"headline": "Racing for Top, Owners of Knicks and Nets See the Bottom Fall Out", "body": "\nThe rivalry began with the unveiling of an oversize billboard. At the time, the battle was not between pro basketball teams as much as it was between two very wealthy men, both classic New York characters but from opposite ends of the cultural universe.         \n\nOne was  \n,\u00a0a\u00a0Russian billionaire playboy who had recently bought  \n, a sleepy team ready for a makeover. The other was  \n, a real estate and media magnate who owned the  \n, among other New York institutions, and was used to getting his way.\u00a0         \n\nProkhorov went after Dolan from the get-go. In 2010, he placed the billboard, 225 feet by 99 feet, directly opposite Madison Square Garden with his own portrait next to that of Jay Z, the celebrity face of the new-look Nets, who were moving to Brooklyn.         \n\nThe spending war was on. Now, three years and several hundred million dollars later, the two teams will face off Thursday in a nationally televised game that was supposed to be a marquee event.         \n\nBut there is a twist: The Nets and the Knicks are among the worst teams in the N.B.A. this year, franchises in a free fall despite their eye-popping, league-topping payrolls.         \n\nSome critics blame the one-upmanship between Dolan and Prokhorov as a critical part of the problem. In trying to outdo each other, have the two owners overdone it? Have they focused too much\u00a0on\u00a0the intracity rivalry at the expense of building a contender?         \n\nRod Thorn, a former Nets president, said Prokhorov had come to New York determined to make a splash. \u201cFrom the start he said that he wanted to have a really good team, and he was going to do whatever he had to do to make that happen,\u201d Thorn said. \u201cThat was his mantra, and he wasn\u2019t shy about it.\u201d         \n\nIn a race to win, both teams have traded away draft picks, locked themselves into punitive contracts for aging players and underachieved, shockingly so. Their big moves \u2014 trades, free-agent signings \u2014 have often been almost in sync, as if the teams have been clumsy dance partners stepping on each other\u2019s toes.         \n\nProkhorov and Dolan seem to have studied the Steinbrenner playbook, paying top dollar for big-name players who may be past their prime. The formula has worked for the Yankees (except when it hasn\u2019t); it has yet to bear fruit on a New York basketball court.         \n\nDavid Stern, the N.B.A.\u2019s commissioner, said he did not think the owners were competing to top each other. \u201cI think what they\u2019ve done is try to show their fans that they want to win, and they\u2019ll do whatever they have to do,\u201d he said.         \n\nBefore Prokhorov, the Nets were an unflashy, unstable team that mostly lost without distinction. Their predicament had long frustrated Stern.         \n\nAccording to Thorn, the Nets, under previous ownership, once inquired about sharing the Garden with the Knicks, the way the Los Angeles Clippers share Staples Center with the Lakers. The proposal never gained traction, but had Dolan signed on, he might have avoided having a competing building in Brooklyn and possibly ever hearing Prokhorov\u2019s name. The Nets\u2019 move to Barclays Center, which opened last season, has given the franchise a badly needed face-lift and a promising new fan base.         \n\nBut not, at least so far this season, a winning team. The Nets are 5-13 despite having the league\u2019s highest payroll, $101 million, along with a luxury-tax bill of $82 million.         \n\nThe Knicks may be worse, with a 3-13 record and a nine-game losing streak. They have the N.B.A.\u2019s second-highest payroll.         \n\nThursday\u2019s night showdown will not be the battle for bragging rights envisioned when the season opened. Instead, it looks likely to be a slog to avoid further embarrassment.         \n\nIf the teams are similarly troubled, the contrasts between the two owners are striking. The dapper Prokhorov is 6 feet 8 inches and knows his way around a basketball court. The rumpled Dolan is more than a foot shorter and sings the blues in a band.         \n\nProkhorov is considered to be a self-made man in post-Soviet Russia. A jet-setter who revels in stirring up trouble, he has been largely an absentee owner in New York. On the rare occasions he drops in on the Nets, Prokhorov can be charming and witty with the news media.
