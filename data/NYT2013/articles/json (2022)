{"headline": "Red Bulls Rewind: It\u2019s a Wrap", "body": "\nAmong his many haiku-like observations, the skillful genius and soccer philosopher Johan Cruyff once said, \u201cThey can\u2019t beat you, but you can lose to them.\u201d         \n\nThat, in essence, is the story of the Red Bulls\u2019 playoff run.         \n\nThat is not to denigrate the achievement of the Houston Dynamo, a team wonderfully coached by Dominic Kinnear that won back-to-back titles in 2006 and 2007 and lost in the final in each of the past two years to the Los Angeles Galaxy. But by making fatal mistakes on defense in each of their playoff games this season, the last in overtime at Red Bull Arena on Wednesday night, the Red Bulls torpedoed themselves.         \n\nThat the Red Bulls were the best team over a nine-month season in Major League Soccer is indisputable, the standings say, and they have a nice silver platter \u2014 the Supporters Shield, given to the top team in the regular season \u2014 to show for it. But that piece of silverware now appears as forlorn as the plate holding the remnants of Thanksgiving Day dinner. All that is left is to pick over the bones, stash the leftovers and take a snooze.         \n\nIn the context of the zero-sum game that are the playoffs in North American sports, this season was not a success, because \u2014 for the fourth year running, ever since the club moved into a gleaming stadium by the Passaic River in Harrison, N.J. \u2014 the Red Bulls lost a crucial playoff game in their own building.         \n\nLost was a grand opportunity for M.L.S. to have its championship game, M.L.S. Cup, played in the New York metropolitan area. Hardly on par with the coming Super Bowl, which is set to be played a few miles up the New Jersey Turnpike in February, but surely a chance to put the league, and particularly the club, on an unaccustomed pedestal after 18 years of dysfunction, failure and ridicule.         \n\nA cynical observer would gloss over where the Red Bulls were only one year ago: eliminated in the first-round of the playoffs; without a coach or sporting director/general manager; about to decline options on 15 players; and saddled with a designated player, Rafael M\u00e1rquez, who had worn out his welcome. There were also questions about the acquisition of the designated player Tim Cahill, questions that were forgotten and buried by the play this year of the tenacious and loquacious Australian international, who led the team in goals. One can argue that the Red Bulls are now Cahill\u2019s team.         \n\nThis year, with a rookie coach in the New York native and former MetroStars/Red Bulls player Mike Petke, and a savvy and connected sporting director in the Scot Andy Roxburgh, the Red Bulls cobbled together an entertaining and deep roster. In Petke, the club has a passionate leader dedicated to the club in a way that no European coach, mediocre or well-known, could possibly be. Kinnear may have won the coaching duel over Petke in the playoffs, but Petke is not the first, and surely will not be the last, to be beaten by a Kinnear team. Petke was able to communicate his passion and commitment to his players, but as much as he might have liked, he could not suit up and step on the field of play.         \n\nAfter Wednesday\u2019s debacle in Harrison, the Internet overflowed with comments from disgruntled fans who again lamented the decision by M.L.S. to disregard the away-goals rule used in cup competitions in most of the rest of the world, particularly in Europe. The Red Bulls\u2019 two goals last week at Houston would have negated the need for overtime after the 1-1 tie in New Jersey. But this is not Europe, and M.L.S. is not the Champions League. And everyone knew the rules. Will M.L.S. one day adopt the away-goals rule? Perhaps. Will it ever move its calendar to a European schedule and not play on FIFA\u2019s international dates? Maybe. Promotion and relegation? Not bloody likely. Will M.L.S. continue to tweak its playoff system? Count on it.
