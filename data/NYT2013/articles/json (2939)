{"headline": "Obama\u2019s Backers Seek Big Donors to Press Agenda", "body": "\n \n\u2019s political team is fanning out across the country in pursuit of an ambitious goal: raising $50 million to convert his re-election campaign into a powerhouse national advocacy network, a sum that would rank the new group as one of Washington\u2019s biggest lobbying operations.         \n\nBut the rebooted campaign, known as  \n, has plunged the president and his aides into a campaign finance limbo with few clear rules, ample potential for influence-peddling, and no real precedent in national politics.         \n\nIn private meetings and phone calls, Mr. Obama\u2019s aides have made clear that the new organization will rely heavily on a small number of deep-pocketed donors, not unlike the \u201c \n\u201d whose influence on political campaigns Mr. Obama once deplored.         \n\nAt least half of the group\u2019s budget will come from a select group of donors who will each contribute or raise $500,000 or more, according to donors and strategists involved in the effort.         \n\nUnlike a presidential campaign, Organizing for Action has been set up as a tax-exempt \u201csocial welfare group.\u201d That means it is not bound by federal contribution limits, laws that bar White House officials from soliciting contributions, or the stringent reporting requirements for campaigns. In their place, the new group will self-regulate.         \n\nOfficials said it would voluntarily disclose the names of large donors every few months and would not ask administration personnel to solicit money, though Obama aides will probably appear at some events.         \n\nThe money will pay for salaries, rent and advertising, and will also be used to maintain the expensive voter database and technological infrastructure that knits together Mr. Obama\u2019s 2 million volunteers, 17 million e-mail subscribers and 22 million Twitter followers.         \n\nThe goal is to harness those resources in support of Mr. Obama\u2019s second-term policy priorities, including efforts to curb gun violence and  \n and overhaul  \n procedures. Those efforts began Friday, when thousands of Obama supporters were deployed through more than 80 Congressional districts around the country to rally outside lawmakers\u2019 offices, hold vigils and bombard Congress with e-mails and phone calls urging members to support stricter background checks for gun buyers.         \n\n\u201cThere are wins we can have on guns and immigration,\u201d Jon Carson, the group\u2019s new executive director, told prospective donors on a conference call on Wednesday, according to people who participated. \u201cWe have to change the conventional wisdom on those issues.\u201d         \n\nBut those contributions will also translate into access, according to donors courted by the president\u2019s aides. Next month, Organizing for Action will hold a \u201cfounders summit\u201d at a hotel near the White House, where donors paying $50,000 each will mingle with Mr. Obama\u2019s former campaign manager, Jim Messina, and Mr. Carson, who previously led the White House Office of Public Engagement.         \n\nGiving or raising $500,000 or more puts donors on a national advisory board for Mr. Obama\u2019s group and the privilege of attending quarterly meetings with the president, along with other meetings at the White House. Moreover, the new cash demands on Mr. Obama\u2019s top donors and bundlers come as many of them are angling for appointments to administration jobs or ambassadorships.         \n\n\u201cIt just smells,\u201d said Bob Edgar, the president of Common Cause, which advocates tighter regulation of campaign money. \u201cThe president is setting a very bad model setting up this organization.\u201d         \n\nMr. Obama\u2019s new organization has drawn rebukes in recent days from watchdog groups, which view it as another step away from the tighter campaign regulation Mr. Obama once championed. Over the past two years, he has reversed course on several campaign finance issues, by blessing a super PAC created by former aides and accepting large corporate contributions for his second inauguration.         \n\nMany traditional advocacy organizations, including the Sierra Club and the National Rifle Association, are set up as social welfare groups, or  \n in tax parlance. But unlike those groups, Organizing for Action appears to be an extension of the administration, stocked with alumni of Mr. Obama\u2019s White House and campaign teams and devoted solely to the president\u2019s second-term agenda.         \n\nRobert K. Kelner, a Republican election lawyer who works with other outside groups, said the arrangement \u201cpresents a rather simple loophole in the otherwise incredibly complex web of government ethics regulations that are intended to insulate government officials from outside influence.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/23/us/politics/obamas-backers-seek-deep-pockets-to-press-agenda.html", "date": "2013-02-22", "description": "President Obama\u2019s political team is attempting to raise $50 million to convert his re-election campaign into a powerhouse lobbying group for his second-term goals."}
