{"headline": "Skepticism and Wariness in Talk of Syria Attack", "body": "\nWAYNESBURG, Pa. \u2014 From his bar-side perch at Hot Rod\u2019s House of Barbeque here, 57-year-old Wolf Tripp argued that President George W. Bush had ample cause a decade ago to dispatch troops and armor into Iraq to topple Saddam Hussein. \u201cLook at the mass graves,\u201d he declared. \u201cHussein gassed his own people.\u201d         \n\nThe gassing last month of hundreds of Syrian civilians is entirely another matter. And sending cruise missiles there to punish the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, is out of the question, Mr. Tripp said this week.         \n\n\u201cWhat are we going to do, borrow more money from China to fight?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s their civil war. Why are we going in there?\u201d         \n\nAs President Obama tries to rally domestic support for military action against Syria, the skepticism in Waynesburg only underscores the political hurdles he faces. This bucolic, if fading, corner of southwest Pennsylvania wears its patriotism on its sleeve, shirttail and pockets. At the time of Mr. Bush\u2019s decision to invade Iraq, a Quinnipiac University poll in Pennsylvania found that 86 percent of the voters in and around Waynesburg were solidly behind him.         \n\nBut in myriad ways, the calculus has changed. Some say they now believe that domestic needs neglected during a decade of war override foreign imperatives. Some, reviewing years of pitched struggle in Afghanistan and Iraq, see the Middle East as quicksand that must be avoided at all costs. Some say that Syria\u2019s civil war is Syria\u2019s problem, and that the United States is not the Mr. Fix-it for all of the world\u2019s crises.         \n\nAnd here, at least, more than a few see military action against Syria as unacceptable simply because it is Mr. Obama\u2019s idea.         \n\nIn town to speak to students at Waynesburg University about Syria, the area\u2019s congressman, Tim Murphy, a Republican who called himself undecided, said his office had received a few hundred calls and messages from constituents about Syria. \u201cGenerally, the calls are like this: \u2018I can\u2019t stand President Obama; don\u2019t you dare go along with him,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said.         \n\nIn the university library, Mr. Murphy spent an hour tutoring some 20 undergraduates on the complexities of Congress\u2019s impending decision. When he finished, all but one of the students pronounced involvement in Syria a mistake. Mr. Obama\u2019s main argument that the world has a moral obligation to act against those who use chemical weapons went unmentioned.         \n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go in if I were you,\u201d said one of the undergraduates, Jon Waldon, 22. \u201cPublic opinion was against it. Second off, we\u2019re in a lot of debt. Third off, there haven\u2019t been United States citizens targeted in the attack.\u201d         \n\nOff campus, the attitudes were similar. Jennifer Taylor said that she was managing the officers\u2019 club at the Marine Corps Air Station in Cherry Point, N.C., and cheering on Mr. Bush when American forces invaded Iraq. But this week, from her spot tending bar at Hot Rod\u2019s, she was decidedly against the use of force in Syria and questioned Mr. Obama\u2019s motivations in proposing it.         \n\n\u201cObama was against\u201d the invasion of Iraq, Ms. Taylor noted, \u201cand I don\u2019t understand why he\u2019s changed his stance.\u201d Seconds later, she offered an explanation: \u201cHe\u2019s having trouble keeping his popularity up; this war on guns has made him unpopular. And this is his way of getting back up.\u201d         \n\nIndeed, her customer, Mr. Tripp, suggested that the use of chemical weapons was actually a plot by Al Qaeda to lure the United States into toppling the Syrian government, and that Mr. Obama was falling for it. Terrorists will rush into the vacuum once Mr. Assad is gone, he warned.         \n\nTo be sure, not everyone here believes a strike against Syria is a mistake. \u201cWe\u2019re the watchdog of the world, and something\u2019s got to be done,\u201d Blair Zimmerman, a Democrat and a Greene County commissioner \u2014 Waynesburg is the county seat \u2014 said during a chat in the county office building. \u201cI\u2019m all for missile and airstrikes \u2014 but ending it there.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/us/proudly-patriotic-but-skeptical-on-syria-attack.html", "date": "2013-09-05", "description": "As President Obama tries to rally domestic support for military action against Syria, the skepticism in Waynesburg, Pa.,  underscores the political hurdles he faces."}
