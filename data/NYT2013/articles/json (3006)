{"headline": "New Guidelines Call for Broad Changes in Science Education", "body": "\nEducators unveiled new guidelines on Tuesday that call for sweeping changes in the way science is taught in the United States \u2014 including, for the first time, a recommendation that  \n be taught as early as middle school.         \n\nThe guidelines also take a firm stand that children must learn about evolution, the central organizing idea in the biological sciences for more than a century, but one that still provokes a backlash among some religious conservatives.         \n\nThe guidelines, known as the  \n, are the first broad national recommendations for science instruction since 1996. They were developed by a consortium of 26 state governments and several groups representing scientists and teachers.         \n\nStates are not required to adopt them, but 26 states have committed to seriously considering the guidelines. They include Arizona, Arkansas, California, Iowa, Kansas and New York. Other states could also adopt the standards.         \n\nEducators involved in drawing them up said the guidelines were intended to combat widespread scientific ignorance, to standardize teaching among states, and to raise the number of high school graduates who choose scientific and technical majors in college, a critical issue for the country\u2019s economic future.         \n\nThe focus would be helping students become more intelligent science consumers by learning how scientific work is done: how ideas are developed and tested, what counts as strong or weak evidence, and how insights from many disciplines fit together into a coherent picture of the world.         \n\nLeaders of the effort said that teachers may well wind up covering fewer subjects, but digging more deeply into the ones they do cover. In some cases, traditional classes like biology and chemistry may disappear entirely from high schools, replaced by courses that use a case-study method to teach science in a more holistic way.         \n\nIn many respects, the standards are meant to do for science what a separate set of guidelines known as the Common Core is supposed to do for English and mathematics: impose and raise standards, with a focus on critical thinking and primary investigation. To date, 45 states and Washington have adopted the Common Core standards.         \n\n\u201cThis is a huge deal,\u201d said David L. Evans, the executive director of the  \n. \u201cWe depend on science in so many aspects of our lives. There\u2019s a strong feeling that we need to help people understand the nature of science itself, as an intellectual pursuit.\u201d         \n\nThe climate and evolution standards are just two aspects of a set of guidelines containing hundreds of new ideas on how to teach science. But they have already drawn hostile commentary from conservative groups critical of mainstream scientific thinking.         \n\nFor instance, as the standards were being drafted, a group called  \n, which lists officers in Florida and Kansas, distributed a nine-page  \n attacking them. It warned that the standards ignored evidence against evolution, promoted \u201csecular humanism,\u201d and threatened to \u201ctake away the right of parents to direct the religious education of their children.\u201d         \n\nIn many states, extensive scientific instruction does not begin until high school. The guidelines call for injecting far more science into the middle grades, with climate change being one among many topics. In high school, students would learn in more detail about the human role in generating emissions that are altering the planetary climate.         \n\nWhile thousands of schools in the United States already teach climate change to some degree, they are usually doing it voluntarily, and often in environmental studies classes. In many more schools, the subject does not come up because students are not offered those specialized courses, and state guidelines typically do not require that the issue be raised in traditional biology or chemistry classes.         \n\nAdvocates of climate literacy hailed the new standards, saying they could fill a critical gap in public awareness.         \n\n\u201cQuite simply, students have a right to know about climate science and solutions,\u201d said Sarah Shanley Hope, the executive director of the  \n, which offers one-day programs in schools.         \n\nMany states are expected to adopt the guidelines over the next year or two, but it could be several years before the guidelines are translated into detailed curriculum documents, teachers are trained in the material and standardized tests are revised.         \n\nAnd all of this has to happen at a time when state education departments and many local schools are under severe financial strain. Inevitably, educators said, some states will do it better than others.         \n\nThe other states that helped draw up the guidelines were Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, Washington and West Virginia. The organizations included the  \n, the  \n, the  \n and  \n, a nonprofit education group that helped develop the earlier common  \n in mathematics and English. Financing was provided by private foundations, including the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the Noyce Foundation and the Cisco Foundation, as well as DuPont.         \n\nOutlining how the standards might change science classrooms, educators said they foresaw more use of real-world examples, like taking students to a farm or fish hatchery \u2014 perhaps repeatedly, over the course of years \u2014 to help them learn principles from biology, chemistry and physics.         \n\nEducators want to introduce students to topics that can be made comprehensible only by drawing on the ideas and methods of many scientific disciplines, one of the reasons climate change and other large-scale environmental problems are seen as holding so much potential in the classroom.         \n\nSome teachers are already ahead of the curve.         \n\nJudith Luber-Narod, a high-school science teacher at the  \n in Worcester, Mass., has incorporated climate change into her environmental studies classes, even though she teaches in a somewhat conservative area.         \n\n\u201cI hesitated a little bit talking about something controversial,\u201d she said. \u201cBut then I thought, how can you teach the environment without talking about it?\u201d         \n\nHer students, on the other hand, love topics some deem controversial, she said. She devised an experiment in which she set up two terrariums with thermometers and then increased the level of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, in one of them.         \n\nThe students watched as that terrarium got several degrees hotter than the other.         \n\n\u201cI say to them, \u2018I\u2019m here to show you the evidence,\u2019\u00a0\u201d she said. \u201c\u00a0\u2018If you want to believe the evidence when we\u2019re done, that\u2019s up to you.\u2019\u00a0\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/10/science/panel-calls-for-broad-changes-in-science-education.html", "date": "2013-04-09", "description": "New standards for curriculum, which at least 26 states have pledged to consider, take a firm stand on climate change and evolution and emphasize hands-on learning."}
