{"headline": "Four Touches, and in the Net", "body": "\nThe Red Bulls\u2019 third goal against Sporting Kansas City on Saturday, the eventual game-winner, was a thing of beauty.         \n\nIt went coast to coast, box to box, in a blink of an eye and resulted in a goal by Lloyd Sam, who was named the player of the week Monday in Major League Soccer for his goal and assist coming off the bench in the top-of-the-standings clash in the Eastern Conference that left the Red Bulls in first place.         \n\n\u201cObviously, that specific play was not in the game plan, but we always encourage Luis to outlet quick and get the attack going,\u201d Red Bulls Coach Mike Petke said in his weekly telephone conference call, referring to goalkeeper Luis Robles.         \n\nSam, a speedy wing, had entered the match in the 60th minute, replacing Eric Alexander (who was \u201creally winded,\u201d Petke said). Nine minutes later, Robles saved a shot by Kansas City\u2019s Soony Saad. Robles looked up and quickly unleashed a 50-yard outlet pass to Jonny Steele on the left flank.         \n\nBelow is video of the goal (apologies for the advertisement preceding the clip):         \n\n\u201cOur biggest target today was that when we do possess the ball we have to play it quick forward and beat them there and leave six or seven guys out of the play,\u201d Petke said.         \n\nAnd that is exactly what happened.         \n\nAfter crossing the midfield line as the ball approached, Steele let the ball bounce once, touched it softly with the instep of his left foot, and then curled a left-footed pass around the K.C. defense that found the streaking Sam coming out of the midfield. Sam settled the ball with his right foot, cut it around Peterson Joseph with his left and beat goalkeeper Jimmy Nielsen with a curling left-footed shot for what proved to be the game-winning goal in the Red Bulls\u2019 3-2 victory. (The goal made the score, 3-1, but the Red Bulls allowed a score in second-half injury time, the 12th time this season they have yielded a goal in the final 15 minutes of a match.)         \n\nOn the play, several Sporting players raised their arms in an appeal for offside and also stopped running on the play, allowing Sam to deal with Joseph one-on-one. As the video shows, he was onside.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we envisioned all week as far as that type of play,\u201d Petke said. \u201cGetting numbers up front is how they attack. It was extremely gratifying and enjoyable to watch it all unfold. It was a great pass from Steele and a phenomenal first touch from Lloyd.\u201d         \n\nPetke, in his first season as the club\u2019s coach (he was ejected for the first time late in Saturday\u2019s game) is a stickler for preparation. Sporting, under Coach Peter Vermes, is known for its tenacious style using high pressure to keep possession and create chances in the opposition\u2019s defensive zone. Opponents often attempt long, aimless clearances simply to relieve pressure. But Petke had a different idea.         \n\n\u201cWe went in with the right preparation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wanted to play it quickly out of the back and try to catch them. I\u2019m more proud that the guys actually listened and bought into it. I knew we would be behind the ball at K.C. \u2014 they're one of the best teams in the league at home. Potent and strong attacking-wise and defensively. You can either control the ball or just kick long and let them have it back. I knew we could exploit outside. I didn\u2019t use the word 'counterattack' all week. It was a bit of counter-mentality.\u201d         \n\nSam, who also earned an assist on a goal, the Red Bulls\u2019 second, by Fabian Espindola, finished the match with a slight quadriceps injury which could keep him out of the game Saturday at the Columbus Crew. In addition, defender Kosuke Kimura remains sidelined with a concussion sustained against Sporting. And midfielder Tim Cahill is not expected back until later this month as he recuperates from a knee injury.         \n\nWith the victory, the Red Bulls (11-7-5, 38 points) have notched consecutive victories over two conference leaders: Real Salt Lake and Sporting Kansas City.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a good position,\u201d Petke said. \u201cWe have to take advantage of it.\u201d         \n\nIn three of four matches remaining in August, the Red Bulls play at Columbus (eighth place in the Eastern Conference); and at Chivas USA and against D.C. United, both of which are in last place in their conferences.
