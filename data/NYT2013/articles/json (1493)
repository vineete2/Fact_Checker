{"headline": "Ice Cream\u2019s Identity Crisis", "body": "\nBack then, we knew something was up if our mother returned from ShopRite with a half-gallon of Breyers ice cream. It meant that another 8-year-old first communicant had feigned an understanding of transubstantiation. It meant that someone was celebrating her first birthday, or that someone had seen his last.         \n\nMost of all, it meant a reprieve from the cheaper fake version of ice cream that usually defiled our freezer, a store-brand ice milk that tasted like nothing so much as frozen sadness. Ice milk represented dessert as punishment.         \n\nBut in certain working-class homes, the Breyers brand lent a momentary class that lasted as long as room temperature would allow, in part because it was \u201cAll Natural.\u201d The Breyers vanilla that my father used as a salve for his psychic wounds (administered late at night, by spoon) had flecks of vanilla bean. And the Breyers strawberry that I preferred could be stirred into a fruity, pinkish goop that I savored in loud, teasing slurps; the more this irritated siblings, the sweeter the taste.         \n\nToday, you will still see the Breyers brand at your friendly neighborhood grocery conglomerate. But do not assume, as I did, that just any Breyers carton will transport you to those halcyon days when a war waged in Vietnam, the president kept an enemies list and the slurping of melted strawberry could ignite a glorious dining-room donnybrook. Things have changed.         \n\nFirst, as part of typical trompe l\u2019oeil packaging, the cartons now hold 48 ounces, not the half-gallon\u2019s 64. (The good news is that your hands haven\u2019t become freakishly large; the bad news is that you\u2019re not suddenly much stronger.)         \n\nSecond, that age-old Breyers boast of \u201cAll Natural\u201d has been replaced with \u201cQuality,\u201d which is one of those impressive words that loses impact the more you think about it.         \n\nLastly, not all Breyers is what we once understood the name to mean. A Breyers carton in the store\u2019s freezer might be ice cream, but the Breyers carton right beside it, identical in nearly every way, might be something called \u201cfrozen dairy dessert\u201d \u2014 which, when translated from the original Orwell, means: not ice cream.         \n\nRemember the old schoolyard song?         \n\nI scream,         \n\nYou scream,         \n\nWe all scream for frozen dairy dessert ...         \n\nYou might ask what the difference is between ice cream and a frozen dairy dessert, and I might answer that it is the same as the difference between a slice of American cheese and a slice of Kraft Singles American Pasteurized Prepared Cheese Product. Since this is not helpful, we turn to a spokeswoman for the Food and Drug Administration, the guardian of \u201cstandards of identity,\u201d who explained the distinction in a written response: \u201cIce cream requires specific levels of milk fat content, nonfat milk solids content, total solids in each gallon of ice cream, and total weight in each gallon of ice cream, while frozen dairy products do not.\u201d         \n\nIn general, ice cream has at least 10 percent dairy fat, and a frozen dairy dessert does not. In my freezer, the Breyers vanilla fudge twirl frozen dairy dessert has the ubiquitous corn syrup, and the Breyers vanilla ice cream does not.         \n\nWhy, Breyers, why?         \n\nBefore H\u00e4agen-Dazs, before Ben & Jerry\u2019s, before ice cream became an artisanal product that could not be fully appreciated unless you had personally squeezed Elsie\u2019s udder \u2014 there was Breyers. So: why?         \n\nFirst, a little history. Breyers began as a family business in Philadelphia in 1866. Sixty years later, it became part of what is now Kraft. Then, in 1993, Unilever \u2014 a multinational goliath that makes a variety of products, including soap and ice cream, but do not confuse the two \u2014 bought the Breyers brand and moved it first to Green Bay, Wis., then to Englewood Cliffs, N.J.         \n\nNick Soukas, the brand-building director for Unilever\u2019s ice cream in the United States, said that Breyers introduced its line of frozen dairy desserts in the last couple of years in direct response to what we, the consumers, want.         \n\n\u201cPeople really drove that decision,\u201d he said.         \n\nIn other words: it\u2019s our fault?         \n\nMr. Soukas did not mention the possibility that using less dairy fat is cheaper, but he did say that people have different flavor and texture desires. Through various surveys and taste tests, he said, \u201cPeople are telling us, \u2018We want a smoother texture.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nSmoother than ice cream?         \n\n\u201cSmoother than ice cream.\u201d         \n\nAlthough ice cream still represents about 60 percent of the Breyers line, Mr. Soukas said, frozen dairy desserts have proved so popular that consumer complaints \u2014 at least those to the company \u2014 have plummeted. And he dismissed those howls of outrage expressed in  \n as representative of a tiny, tiny minority.         \n\nBut what about the ingredients? \u201cThey\u2019re basically the same ingredients,\u201d Mr. Soukas said. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much about the ingredients as the way they\u2019re put together.\u201d         \n\nI may not be a professional food writer, but I once dabbled in investigative journalism. So I donned my fedora and read the ingredients.         \n\nBreyers natural vanilla ice cream: milk, cream, sugar, tara gum, natural flavor. Period.         \n\nBreyers extra-creamy vanilla frozen dairy dessert: milk, sugar, corn syrup, cream, whey, mono and diglycerides, carob bean gum, guar gum, carrageenan, natural flavor, annatto (for color), vitamin A palmitate, tara gum.         \n\nGranted, the ingredients in Breyers frozen dairy desserts do not include plutonium, or motor oil, or Kraft Singles American Pasteurized Prepared Cheese Product. And granted, this is a big country: some people out there might be demanding more corn syrup, less cream, in their frozen treats.         \n\nBut something more than ice cream is melting away. This is what I brood about, late at night, as I apply basic ice cream to my psychic wounds.
