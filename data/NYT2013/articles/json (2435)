{"headline": "Marriage Is Yard Work", "body": "\nSAN DIEGO \u2014 On a recent Thursday evening, the United States Navy notified Ryan Benoit that instead of tracking the $150 million overhaul of the Essex, an 844-foot-long air and amphibious assault ship, he should probably drink a couple of gin and tonics with his wife and water the drooping lettuce in his planter.         \n\nThis being the year of the Great Congressional Sequester, the next day was Furlough Friday. And Mr. Benoit, a 37-year-old civilian port engineer and a lieutenant commander in the Navy Reserve, would be spending the accidental holiday in the garden.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m being told not to answer the phone,\u201d Mr. Benoit said. This slackness was a shock to his routine. \u201cI\u2019m always doing something. I very rarely get to relax.\u201d         \n\nOrders are orders. But there was work to be done at home, too: a renovation of the yard that is almost as ambitious as the warship\u2019s and only a little less reliant on industrial supplies. For the last four years, Mr. Benoit and his wife, Chantal Aida Gordon, 30, have been creating the quintessential outdoor room, a couple of blocks from the surfers\u2019 paradise known as Windansea Beach in this city\u2019s La Jolla section.         \n\nThe house? A two-bedroom, one-bath rental. A little over 750 square feet for $2,200 a month. Speak of it no more.         \n\nAs for the yard? This will be a place to host dinner parties and screen Chargers games and stash a shortboard and shower off and plant cactuses and harvest guava and blend cocktails and sleep off a hangover and catch up on back issues of The New Yorker. You know, that kind of space.         \n\nIt will also be a place to blog. As of this spring, the design project has turned into a new garden-and-style site,  \n. The yard is now a backdrop for photographing D.I.Y. delphinium garlands and Wellington boots by Le Chameau.         \n\nIt\u2019s a lot to ask of a 55-by-44-foot, concrete-covered lot. And to the extent that the couple is building practically every piece of furniture and planting every container, it\u2019s a lot to ask of themselves. You might say that Ms. Gordon and Mr. Benoit are not transforming the garden so much as the garden is transforming them.         \n\nJulian Mackler, a longtime friend who photographed the couple\u2019s wedding, has watched this change take root. \u201cSome people want to stay on the sidelines, and some people want to get their hands dirty,\u201d he said on the phone from Harlem. \u201cI never see people my age take such care of a garden unless they\u2019re a straight-up hippie.\u201d         \n\nMs. Gordon moved from New York University to an editorial-assistant post in the West Coast office of Vogue. (You can see her introducing Lauren Conrad to the copy machine in the first few episodes of MTV\u2019s docudrama \u201cThe Hills.\u201d) Mr. Benoit attended the United States Merchant Marine Academy, in Kings Point, N.Y. And for a couple of East Coast transplants, the quest for a classic Southern California space has inspired a shift in consciousness.         \n\n\u201cAt work, I\u2019m in an industrial environment: no plants, no nothing, just a steel structure,\u201d Mr. Benoit said. \u201cIt\u2019s the opposite of when I come home.\u201d         \n\nMs. Gordon looked at her husband sympathetically. \u201cDon\u2019t you think some of those old guys grow some tomatoes?\u201d         \n\nThe blog has revealed the earthy proclivities of many of their urbane friends. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe the number of people who got excited about the jacaranda story,\u201d she said, referring to a post about the omnipresent  \n trees that bloom purple in late May. \u201cTen years ago, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to spot a jacaranda.\u201d         \n\nMr. Benoit said, \u201cFour months ago, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to  \na jacaranda.\u201d         \n\nMs. Gordon added, \u201cIt just deepens your experience when you\u2019re walking down the street and you know what a tree is.\u201d         \n\nBefore Ms. Gordon was a gardener, she was a  \n. She volunteered at a community garden in East Harlem to research a coming-of-age novel, which her agent is now shopping. Titled \u201cThe Fame and Exile of the Lotus Eaters,\u201d it chronicles the escapades of a \u201cteenage nerd\u201d who discovers a new lotus cultivar.         \n\n\u201cThe flower becomes an overnight hit in Manhattan, the way those things do,\u201d she said. \u201cThings go downhill when her friends start using the flower as a study drug.\u201d (As a day job, she works anonymously as a copywriter for a business strategist.)         \n\nBefore Mr. Benoit was a gardener, he was a photographer. On his travels as a reservist, or with Ms. Gordon, he would fill up memory cards with botanical photos.
