{"headline": "Folk Remedy Extracted From Captive Bears Stirs Furor in China", "body": "\nCHENGDU, China \u2014 It was, at first glance, a rather modest initial public offering by a small Chinese company seeking to expand production of the key ingredient used in traditional remedies said to shrink gallstones, reduce fevers and sooth the aftereffects of excessive drinking.         \n\nBut  \n, the country\u2019s largest producer of bear bile extract, apparently overlooked one important factor before submitting its application to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange: China\u2019s increasingly audacious animal rights movement.         \n\nGuizhentang\u2019s proposal to triple the company\u2019s stock of captive bears, to 1,200 from 400, provoked a firestorm from those opposed to bear bile farming, a process that involves inserting tubes into the abdomens of bears and \u201cmilking\u201d them, sometimes for years.         \n\nProtesters in bear suits picketed drugstores, hackers briefly brought down Guizhentang\u2019s Web site and more than 70 Chinese celebrities, including the basketball star Yao Ming and the pop diva Han Hong, circulated a petition calling on the stock exchange to reject the I.P.O.         \n\nAfter some of China\u2019s biggest news media outlets posted harrowing  \n revealing cages so tight the bears could barely move,  \n, saying it needed more time to put together its filing.         \n\nFor China\u2019s animal welfare advocates, the victory signaled the growing clout of a movement that is frequently derided as bourgeois, frivolous or worse. Its most vociferous opponents paint animal advocates as foreign-financed traitors who would do away with such hallowed Chinese traditions as dog meat hot pot, ivory carving and dried deer penis, consumed to increase virility.         \n\nDeborah Cao, a lawyer who frequently writes about animal rights in China, said campaigns like the one that defeated Guizhentang showed how social media brought together the generation of educated Chinese urbanites who grew up with household pets and anthropomorphic Disney characters. \u201cIt\u2019s a bottom-up, grass-roots movement, one that is contributing to an emerging civil society increasingly aware of individual rights and obligations, be it to humans or animals,\u201d she said.         \n\nSuch activism is even more notable given the constraints the Communist Party typically imposes on public lobbying, street protests or any unsanctioned organizing.         \n\nAdvocates have not yet persuaded the government to enact animal welfare legislation. But optimists say they have started to chip away at the long-held notion that animals exist to satisfy the medicinal and gastronomical needs of humans.         \n\nActivists point to the growing visibility of public awareness campaigns targeting the consumption of shark fins as well as a recent spate of vigilante rescue efforts that have blocked trucks laden with cats and dogs from reaching the slaughterhouse. In December, the state-run broadcaster CCTV ran a series of expos\u00e9s highlighting the illegal consumption of monitor lizards, rhesus monkeys, barking deer and other wildlife, and the police crackdown on black market dealers that followed.         \n\n\u201cAnimal rights activists are walking an incredibly sensitive tightrope, but I think they\u2019re reaching a tipping point right now,\u201d said Jill Robinson, the director of  \n, an organization based in Hong Kong that has been campaigning for two decades to end bear bile farming.         \n\nStill, despite what appears to be growing public opposition to the practice, the Chinese government is not prepared to end the lucrative trade in ursodeoxycholic acid, the active ingredient found in bear gallbladders. Although scientists have engineered a synthetic alternative, traditionalists claim it lacks the therapeutic punch of raw bile, which can sell for as much as $24,000 a kilogram, roughly half the price of gold.         \n\nScientists have scrutinized the health effects of bear bile but have come to no definitive conclusions. But sold in powdered form as capsules, or as a tonic, bile is considered by many to be an elixir of sorts. Bile marketers say it fortifies the liver, reduces flu symptoms and improves eyesight.         \n\nYang Tingying, a vendor at the wholesale Chinese medicine market here in Chengdu, the provincial capital of Sichuan, insisted that bear bile cures all manner of liver ailments, including hepatitis. \u201cIt\u2019s the best because it\u2019s from nature,\u201d she said, pulling out a pair of desiccated gall bladders, which are illegal to sell.
