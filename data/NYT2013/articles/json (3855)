The response suggests that reaching consensus on immigration law changes remained difficult despite a new bipartisan push since the November elections.         \n\nSpeaking at a high school here in a state that has seen rapid growth in its Hispanic population, the president praised a bipartisan group of senators who  \n a day earlier, saying their plan was very much in line with his own proposals.         \n\nMr. Obama warned, however, that \u201cthe closer we get, the more emotional this debate is going to become.\u201d He said that if Congress did not move forward \u201cin a timely fashion\u201d on its own legislation, he would send up a specific measure \u2014 something the White House has put off for now \u2014 and demand a vote.         \n\nThe president\u2019s speech immediately exposed potential fault lines in the coming debate. He said, for example, that there must be a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants \u201cfrom the outset,\u201d a statement that would seem at odds with the assertion by some senators that citizenship must be tied to tighter border security.         \n\nSenator  \n, the Florida Republican seen as an influential party voice on an issue that cost Republicans in last year\u2019s voting, said he was \u201cconcerned by the president\u2019s unwillingness to accept significant enforcement triggers before current undocumented immigrants can apply for a green card.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWithout such triggers in place,\u201d he went on, \u201cenforcement systems will never be implemented, and we will be back in just a few years dealing with millions of new undocumented people in our country.\u201d         \n\nAlthough Mr. Obama did not say it in his speech, the White House is also proposing that the United States treat same-sex couples the same as other families, meaning that people would be able to use their relationship as a basis to obtain a visa \u2014 another element likely to be resisted by some conservative Republicans.         \n\nBrendan Buck, a spokesman for Speaker John A. Boehner, said in a statement that House Republicans \u201chope the president is careful not to drag the debate to the left and ultimately disrupt the difficult work that is ahead in the House and Senate.\u201d         \n\nA senior administration official said the speech was the start of a concerted campaign to force Republicans to follow through on the bipartisan proposal. He predicted that given the president\u2019s popularity with Hispanic voters, they would find it hard vote down a bill with his name on it.         \n\nMr. Obama offered a familiar list of proposals: tightening security on borders, cracking down on employers who hire illegal immigrants and temporarily issuing more visas to clear the huge backlog of people applying for legal status in the country.         \n\nHis speech, on the heels of the bipartisan Senate proposal, sets the terms for one of the year\u2019s landmark legislative debates. These are only the opening steps in a complicated dance, and both the politics and the policy can be treacherous ground, as shown by the failed effort to overhaul immigration laws in the George W. Bush administration.         \n\nBut the flurry of activity underscores the powerful new momentum behind an overhaul of the system, after an election that dramatized the vulnerability of Republicans on the issue, with Mr. Obama piling up lopsided majorities over Mitt Romney among Hispanic voters.         \n\n\u201cMost Americans agree that it\u2019s time to fix a system that\u2019s been broken for way too long,\u201d Mr. Obama said to an audience of about 2,000 high school students, many of them Hispanic. They applauded loudly when he mentioned the Dream Act, which offers amnesty to children of immigrants who are in the United States illegally.         \n\nIn scrambling to present their blueprint on Monday, the day before Mr. Obama\u2019s speech, the senators stole a march on the president. But their intent appeared less to undermine his efforts than to stake out their own role in drafting a comprehensive bill.         \n\n\u201cIt is a fascinating Washington horse race that you don\u2019t always see, and a signal of the seriousness to get across the finish line,\u201d said Angela Kelley, an expert on immigration at the  \n, a liberal research group.
