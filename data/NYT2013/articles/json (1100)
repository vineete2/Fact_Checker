{"headline": "Sign-Up Period Extended Again for Health Plan", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration said Tuesday that it would provide more time for people to complete their applications for health insurance if they could show that they missed the deadline because of problems with the federal health care website.         \n\nThe move was the latest in a series of deadline changes, exemptions and clarifications that have confused insurers and many Americans and opened the administration to increasing criticism from Republicans who have opposed the Affordable Care Act from the start and have repeatedly tried to overturn it.         \n\nIt was not clear on Tuesday how many people would be affected, or how consumers would prove that website errors had prevented them from signing up by the deadline on Tuesday night.         \n\nThe announcement itself was vague, saying only that if website problems had prevented any consumers from enrolling, they might qualify for what the government has called \u201ca special enrollment period.\u201d The administration did not say how long that would last. Nor did it define what website errors might be involved.         \n\nRepublicans said the announcement \u2014 coming a day after the federal website recorded more than two million visits \u2014 showed that President Obama was desperate to increase enrollment, widely seen as a measure of the success of the health care law.         \n\nFor their part, administration officials said the move was a common-sense response to heavy traffic on the website, which they cited as evidence of a huge need for more affordable insurance. Some 48 million Americans are uninsured. Many could qualify for subsidized coverage under the Affordable Care Act.         \n\nTara McGuinness, a White House spokeswoman, said the administration was not providing \u201ca blanket extension,\u201d but was offering to provide \u201cassistance to individuals on a case-by-case basis.\u201d         \n\nAnd Kurt DelBene, the new troubleshooter for the site, said it was performing well. \u201cWith the highest volumes we have seen to date, response time is fast, and the error rate is low,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe move did not mollify insurers who have grown concerned as new problems have erupted since the rollout on Oct. 1 and are worried about how they will be able to provide coverage for everyone who wants it by Jan. 1, when that coverage is supposed to go into effect.         \n\n\u201cThe goal posts keep moving,\u201d William G. Schiffbauer, a lawyer who represents insurance companies, said Tuesday evening. \u201cThat raises questions about whether insurers can collect premiums in a timely manner to pay claims from doctors and hospitals.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThe latest step creates confusion for consumers and insurers,\u201d he added.         \n\nInsurers said that Tuesday\u2019s action, combined with several recent unexpected shifts in federal rules and policy, made it harder for them to predict the number and characteristics of new subscribers. That, in turn, makes it harder for them to predict their costs and complicates efforts to set prices for their products.         \n\nIn general, insurance companies say they need substantial numbers of healthy people to balance the financial risks of covering older Americans who require more medical care.         \n\nThe open enrollment period continues to March 31. People who select health plans on the federal exchange starting Wednesday and continuing through Jan. 15 will generally be entitled to coverage that takes effect on Feb. 1, provided they pay their share of the first month\u2019s premium before then.         \n\nThe new offer to consumers who have had trouble with the website followed the last-minute surge of interest among people seeking coverage, and the administration hailed what it described as \u201camazing interest\u201d in new health insurance options.         \n\nThe original deadline for coverage starting Jan. 1 was Dec. 15. On Nov. 22, the deadline was extended to Dec. 23. On Monday, the White House provided a 24-hour grace period, to 11:59 p.m. on Tuesday.         \n\nThen on Tuesday, in a bid to ensure coverage for all who want it, the administration provided details of the \u201cspecial enrollment period\u201d for some people \u2014 but not all \u2014 who miss the deadline.         \n\n\u201cIf you weren\u2019t able to enroll in an insurance plan by Dec. 23 because of problems you had using HealthCare.gov, you still may be able to get coverage that starts Jan. 1,\u201d the administration told visitors to the website in  \n posted on the health insurance blog at HealthCare.gov. The message also highlighted the assistance available to shoppers.         \n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t enroll by December 23?\u201d it said. \u201cWe can still help you get covered.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/25/us/politics/white-house-again-stretches-health-care-sign-up-deadline.html", "date": "2013-12-24", "description": "The move was the latest in a series of changes that have confused insurers and many Americans and opened the administration to increasing criticism from Republicans."}
