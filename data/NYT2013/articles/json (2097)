{"headline": "A Leader \u2018Both Brilliant and Humble\u2019", "body": "\nThe word was  \n, and it was applied to Michael Weiner, over and over, long before he became the executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association.         \n\n\u201cIt was almost ridiculous,\u201d said Jim Duquette, a former general manager for the Mets and the Baltimore Orioles. \u201cYou\u2019d be negotiating contracts with agents, or just talking shop, and you\u2019d always hear it: \u2018The most reasonable guy in the union, the guy with the best rationale, is Michael Weiner.\u2019 Then they\u2019d go on to explain how he thought about something, and you\u2019d think, \u2018Wow \u2014 this guy really gets it.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nWeiner died on Thursday at his home in New Jersey, at age 51, after a 15-month fight with brain cancer. In January, at the baseball writers\u2019 dinner in New York, Weiner received an award for his courage, an honor he shared with Duquette, who had donated a kidney to his daughter. Weiner, who has three daughters, acknowledged young Lindsey Duquette in his speech and deflected attention from himself.         \n\n\u201cI kind of scratch my head \u2014 it\u2019s much easier for me to do these days \u2014 at the attention paid to how I\u2019m trying to fight my illness,\u201d said Weiner, who had lost most of his hair by then. \u201cAll I\u2019ve tried to do is live my life the way I\u2019ve always lived it. All I\u2019ve tried to do is to do my job as I\u2019ve always tried to do it. The only thing that\u2019s been different is the off-the-charts support I\u2019ve received from so many people in the baseball community.\u201d         \n\nThat affection came pouring out on social media Thursday night, with player after player expressing grief and praising Weiner for his kindness, intelligence and compassion. He served just under four years as the head of the union, but made an indelible mark.         \n\n\u201cMichael had a knack for making every player feel important,\u201d said pitcher Ross Ohlendorf, a player-officer in the union, in a text message from his honeymoon. \u201cHe was both brilliant and humble.\u201d         \n\nIn R. A. Dickey\u2019s first major league camp, in 1997, he remembered feeling intimidated by the longtime union bosses, Donald Fehr and Gene Orza, who addressed his team in spring training. Weiner, a graduate of Harvard Law School, had an important title \u2014 assistant general counsel \u2014 but carried himself with no airs. He wore jeans and Chuck Taylor sneakers, and made Dickey feel as important as a most valuable player.         \n\nThis month, when he accepted his Gold Glove award in New York, Dickey visited Weiner. He seemed very weak, Dickey said, and he knew he would not live much longer. Dickey said he was grateful to give him one last hug.         \n\n\u201cAs players, we knew that everything was going to be O.K. with him at the helm,\u201d Dickey said. \u201cHe was the right guy. There was not one attribute he lacked to be a great leader. We all miss him.\u201d         \n\nWeiner leaves behind a union widely acknowledged as one of the strongest in the nation, whose stance on drug testing, in particular, has evolved under his direction. The patriarch of the union, Marvin Miller, opposed drug testing. Fehr was also resistant for years. Weiner acknowledged the scope of the problem and pushed for sensible solutions.         \n\nThat issue rages on, and others will, too, despite years of labor peace and a collective-bargaining agreement negotiated under Weiner that has continued to enrich players while promoting competitive balance.         \n\nThe acting executive director, Tony Clark, is the first former player to serve in the role. Clark, 41, was a widely respected first baseman \u2014 when he played for the Yankees, teammates called him the hardest worker on the roster \u2014 but he does not have a background in law. He does have an abiding respect for Weiner.         \n\n\u201cWhere we are,\u201d Clark said in an interview last off-season, \u201cis a testament to Marvin, Don and Michael, and really what Michael has done the last three years, in transforming how we functioned for the 20, 25 years with Don and how we needed to change and adapt going forward.\u201d         \n\nNow the game will move forward without Weiner, one of the smartest people it had. Rational thinking can be hard to find in baseball, with so many competing interests among \u2014 and within \u2014 the ranks of the players and the owners. Weiner always had it.         \n\nLast July, at the All-Star Game, players said they were amazed that Weiner was still working, and were inspired by his example. He addressed the writers that week from his wheelchair. He had lost the use of his right arm, and his speech was slow. But he was strong enough to say words that should long be remembered.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I look at things differently,\u201d Weiner said. \u201cMaybe they just became more important to me, more conscious to me. As corny as it sounds, I get up in the morning and I feel I\u2019m going to live each day as it comes. I don\u2019t take any day for granted. What I look for each day is beauty, meaning and joy, and if I can find beauty, meaning and joy, that\u2019s a good day.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/22/sports/baseball/michael-weiner-a-leader-who-knew-how-to-make-every-player-feel-important.html", "date": "2013-11-21", "description": "Michael Weiner served just under four years as the head of the baseball players union, but made an indelible mark, earning praise for his kindness, intelligence and compassion."}
