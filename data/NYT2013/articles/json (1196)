{"headline": "In the N.H.L., a Stricter Standard for Safety\u2019s Sake", "body": "\nWhether it is happening fast enough is a matter for debate, but there is no question that the N.H.L. is evolving when it comes to player safety.         \n\nIn his decision Tuesday to  \n assessed to Boston\u2019s Shawn Thornton by the N.H.L.\u2019s department of player safety, Commissioner Gary Bettman emphasized that the standards of discipline in the league today were far more stringent than they were a decade ago.         \n\nThis remains a point many traditionalists find difficult to digest, including one of the foremost proponent of old-time hockey, the former  \n coach Don Cherry.         \n\nOn his weekly  \n during CBC\u2019s \u201cHockey Night in Canada\u201d on Dec. 14, Cherry did not excuse Thornton for his Dec. 7 attack on the unsuspecting Pittsburgh defenseman Brooks Orpik, which left Orpik with a concussion. But Cherry said that 10 games would have been a more appropriate punishment.         \n\nThat figure also happened to be at the low end of the 10- to 12-game range the N.H.L. Players\u2019 Association argued for in Thornton\u2019s appeal to Bettman. But as Bettman indicated in his support for the ruling, a different calculus is now in place.         \n\n\u201cStandards and expectations have changed over the course of time, just as the playing rules, game tactics and player training have evolved,\u201d Bettman said in denying the appeal.         \n\nSome of that change grew out of an increased awareness about the dangers of head trauma. Rule 48 limited checks to the head when it was introduced in 2010, and it has been strengthened in subsequent seasons.         \n\nOther rule changes governing icing, boarding, and checks from behind have come from the same desire to reduce serious injuries.         \n\nThis evolution is probably also motivated by a fear of lawsuits. In November, a  \n against the league for what they charge was an inadequate response to the dangers of concussions. The family of Derek Boogaard previously filed suit against the league.         \n\n\u201cThe protection of players\u2019 heads has been a matter of intense and increased attention over the course of several years,\u201d Bettman said. \u201cA player who today blatantly flouts the rules in a manner that causes a head injury can and should expect to be severely disciplined.\u201d         \n\nBettman added that players should not be surprised at increased levels of punishment.         \n\nGoing into this weekend, Thornton was still considering whether to appeal the league\u2019s ruling to an independent arbitrator. Such an appeal would plant Thornton even more firmly in the traditionalist camp, a place the N.H.L. left several years ago.         \n\n \n         \n\nThe recent news that USA Hockey is considering an automatic one-fight-and-you\u2019re-ejected rule for junior leagues has prompted more discussion about the diminishing role of fighting in the N.H.L.         \n\nPaul Bissonnette, a Phoenix Coyotes enforcer and fourth-line forward, has fought only once this season. He said this month that he could see the day when the N.H.L. would adopt a similar rule and because of that has tried to become a more complete player. Bissonnette\u2019s 6 points through the Christmas break matches the best total of any of his five previous seasons.         \n\nThe fourth-line Devils forward Cam Janssen is undergoing a similar evolution. Through the Christmas break, he had fought twice, putting him on pace to finish well below his eight-season N.H.L. average, 12. But he had three goals in 22 games, matching the total he had in his previous 312 games.         \n\nAsked if he had tried to cut down on the fighting and improve in other areas, Janssen said: \u201cAbsolutely, 100 percent. I\u2019ve worked on my game and changed a couple things I needed to change.\u201d         \n\nJanssen said that he would still fight if the situation arose but that he needed \u201cto contribute in another way, not just fighting.\u201d         \n\n\u201cYou have to be effective,\u201d he added, \u201cwhether it\u2019s forechecking or playing the system perfectly or body checking or getting the puck out every time or being good in the locker room. You have to integrate all this into your game; otherwise, you\u2019re going to get weeded out.\u201d         \n\nJanssen said his eureka moment came last season, when the Devils demoted him to the American Hockey League.         \n\n\u201cIt had a shock effect,\u201d Janssen said. \u201cI\u2019d been in the league eight years straight. It was like, Oh, O.K., I need to develop. Bottom line is, you need to be able to play the game effectively.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/29/sports/hockey/in-the-nhl-a-stricter-standard-for-safetys-sake.html", "date": "2013-12-28", "description": "Whether it is happening fast enough is a matter for debate, but there is no question that the N.H.L. is evolving when it comes to player safety."}
