{"headline": "New York Examines Over 800 Rape Cases for Possible Mishandling of Evidence", "body": "\nThe New York City medical examiner\u2019s office is undertaking an unusual review of more than 800 rape cases in which critical DNA evidence may have been mishandled or overlooked by a lab technician, resulting in incorrect reports being given to criminal investigators.         \n\nSupervisors have so far found 26 cases in which the technician failed to detect biological evidence when some actually existed, according to the medical examiner\u2019s office. In seven of those cases, full DNA profiles were developed \u2014 in some instances, evidence that sex-crime investigators did not see for years, hampering their ability to develop cases against rape suspects.         \n\nIn one of those instances, the newly discovered DNA profile matched a convicted offender\u2019s sample, leading to an indictment a decade after the evidence was collected, according to Dr. Mechthild Prinz, the director of forensic biology at the medical examiner\u2019s office.         \n\nIn two other instances, the new DNA profiles were linked to people either already convicted or under suspicion.         \n\nThe scope of the problem has yet to be determined; at several points over nearly two years, supervisors in the medical examiner\u2019s office thought they had gotten to the bottom of the technician\u2019s errors, only to find that the trail went further.         \n\n\u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve had anything like this,\u201d said Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the office of the chief medical examiner.         \n\nThe office has been at the forefront of forensic technology; its work after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and in trying to name the unidentified dead in the city\u2019s potter\u2019s field has been hailed. The office, which handles evidence from about 1,500 sexual assault cases a year, is now advocating the acceptance of so-called low copy number DNA \u2014 sometimes transmitted only by a touch \u2014 as a way to link suspects to crimes.         \n\nBut the continuing review of the technician\u2019s cases underscores how DNA evidence, widely perceived as being nearly irrefutable proof of guilt or innocence, can still be subject to human error.         \n\nEach time there is an accusation of a sexual attack, DNA evidence from saliva, semen or blood that may have been left by the assailant is collected in a rape kit. The task of analyzing the evidence falls to the medical examiner\u2019s office, which employs 48 technicians who conduct preliminary tests on the kits.         \n\nThe technician had two responsibilities when processing rape kits: She had to snip cuttings from swabs taken from victims\u2019 bodies and place them in test tubes for DNA analysis by more experienced lab workers.         \n\nShe also inspected the victims\u2019 clothing, usually underwear, for stains that might indicate DNA. Sometimes she overlooked stains, the review found. At other times, she identified stains, but then botched the chemical test used to detect semen and reported finding nothing.         \n\nThe errors, Dr. Prinz said in an interview, involved reporting false negatives, not false positives. \u201cWe do know that nobody was wrongfully convicted,\u201d she added.         \n\nThe medical examiner\u2019s office declined to publicly identify the technician, who worked there for nine years. She resigned in November 2011, after the office moved to terminate her employment, according to documents.         \n\nHer work fell under scrutiny after she enrolled in a training program to become a DNA analyst. As part of the program, she worked on a broader range of cases, including homicides, but her supervisors grew concerned as they \u201ccorrected deficiencies within cases,\u201d according to a letter from the medical examiner\u2019s office. The mistakes persuaded the office to look at her earlier work. The office has not yet concluded its review of 412 cases out of 843 it intends to examine, Mr. Lien said. The cases span from 2001 to 2011.         \n\nIn the course of reviewing the technician\u2019s work, supervisors discovered another problem. Sixteen pieces of evidence, generally swabs sealed in paper envelopes, were found in the wrong rape kit, commingling DNA evidence from 19 rape investigations, according to a letter from the medical examiner\u2019s office.
