But Mr. Cuomo has described the existing law as having \u201cmore holes than Swiss cheese,\u201d and he wants to broaden the number of guns and magazines covered by the law while also making it harder for gun makers to tweak their products to get around the ban.         \n\nMr. Cuomo, a Democrat, will outline his proposal in his State of the State address, but even before he speaks, he has incited anxiety among gun owners by acknowledging in a radio interview that \u201cconfiscation could be an option\u201d for assault weapons owned by New Yorkers. Since that interview, Mr. Cuomo has not mentioned the idea, and his aides have acknowledged that it would be impractical.         \n\nBut gun rights groups have seized on the comment, even promoting  \n that declares, \u201cWe do not live in Nazi Germany,\u201d and asks the Obama administration to block any effort at confiscation by Mr. Cuomo.         \n\nSince the shootings in Newtown, Mr. Cuomo has been trying to negotiate an agreement on gun laws with legislative leaders in Albany \u2014 he even contemplated calling them back into special session last month \u2014 and the talks continued into Tuesday, as the governor sought an agreement before his speech.         \n\nAccording to people briefed on the talks, the governor is considering not only rewriting the state\u2019s assault weapons ban, but also proposing more expansive use of mental health records in background checks of gun buyers, lower limits on the capacity of magazines sold legally in New York and a new requirement that gun permits be subject to periodic recertification.         \n\nNew York already has some of the toughest gun laws in the country, and the debate over new restrictions here reflects a significant change in the national conversation over guns, as states and the federal government grapple with whether and how to limit the possession of weapons that have been used in multiple mass killings in recent years.         \n\nMr. Cuomo, a shotgun owner, has long spoken in favor of tougher gun control but has not used his considerable political muscle to make the issue a priority over his two years as governor. Now, citing the recent killings, he is seeking to strike a deal that could be used as a model in other statehouses.         \n\n\u201cI think what the nation is saying now after Connecticut, what people in New York are saying is \u2018Do something, please,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Cuomo told reporters recently.         \n\nNew York\u2019s existing assault weapons ban was approved in the aftermath of another mass shooting, at Columbine High School in 1999. The next year, Gov. George E. Pataki surprised his fellow Republicans by pushing through the Legislature  \n, including the measure to outlaw assault weapons. But many high-powered rifles now in production are exempt from the ban because, advocacy groups say, manufacturers have altered their products to circumvent the law.         \n\n\u201cThis is a singular moment in the history of the gun control movement,\u201d said Richard M. Aborn, the president of the Citizens Crime Commission of New York City. \u201cThe governor has the opportunity to set the high-water mark and continue New York\u2019s leadership position in having the most effective gun control laws in the country.\u201d         \n\nThe state\u2019s District Attorneys Association  \n to the governor and legislative leaders on Tuesday calling for, among other things, the elimination of a grandfather clause that allows some high-capacity magazines. And  \n have endorsed a set of proposals that includes limiting handgun purchases to one per month, requiring a new form of ballistics identification and putting in place universal background checks.         \n\nBut Mr. Cuomo faces a complicated political landscape in Albany. The Assembly is controlled by Democrats who are eager for more gun restrictions, while the Senate this year is to be controlled by  \n of Republicans, who have largely resisted new gun laws, and dissident Democrats, who support more gun control. Mr. Cuomo, during his first half of his term, assiduously courted Senate Republicans, even persuading them to allow the vote that legalized same-sex marriage, but he has indicated that he is now willing to challenge the Republicans over the gun issue.         \n\nOn Saturday, after the  \n for violations of existing gun laws, but not tightening the assault weapons ban, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s spokesman said the Republican proposal \u201cinsults the common sense of New Yorkers.\u201d         \n\nGun rights advocates argue that Mr. Cuomo is wrong to focus his attention on assault weapons; of 769 homicides in New York State in 2011, only five were committed with rifles of any kind, according to the State Division of Criminal Justice Services.         \n\n\u201cThis issue is not about guns, and the reason they are pushing the gun issue is because it\u2019s much easier for them to say, \u2018Look what we did; we\u2019re going to make people safer in New York. We passed more gun laws,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Thomas H. King, the president of the New York State Rifle and Pistol Association. Mr. King, echoing the recommendation of the National Rifle Association, said that instead of banning certain guns, New York should require armed security at all schools.         \n\nSenator Catharine Young, Republican of Olean, in western New York, said she had been receiving calls from constituents who were worried about what action the Legislature might take.         \n\n\u201cThe vast majority of people who own firearms in my district are law-abiding and extremely responsible,\u201d Ms. Young said. \u201cThey aren\u2019t the problem; it\u2019s illegal guns and untreated mental illness that are the problems.\u201d         \n\nCracking down on high-powered weapons has long been a priority for many urban Democrats in the Legislature; to draw attention to the issue, one senator even went to a gun shop near Albany  \n while the transaction was recorded with a hidden camera.         \n\n\u201cA lot of people look at this as a battle between people who want to take away all the guns and people who want to have no restrictions on guns; but most members of the public and most members of the Legislature understand that reasonable restrictions on guns make sense,\u201d said Assemblyman Brian Kavanagh, a Manhattan Democrat. Last weekend, he said, brought another reminder of the urgency at hand: a 16-year-old from Mr. Kavanagh\u2019s district was  \n on Friday.
