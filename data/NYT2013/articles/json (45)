{"headline": "Heat, Flood or Icy Cold, Extreme Weather Rages Worldwide", "body": "\nWORCESTER, England \u2014 Britons may remember 2012 as the year the weather spun off its rails in a chaotic concoction of drought, deluge and flooding, but the unpredictability of it all turns out to have been all too predictable: Around the world, extreme has become the new commonplace.         \n\nEspecially lately. China is  \n in nearly 30 years. Brazil is in the grip of a dreadful heat spell. Eastern Russia is so freezing \u2014 minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit, and counting \u2014 that the traffic lights recently stopped working in the city of Yakutsk.         \n\nBush fires are  \n, fueled by a record-shattering heat wave. Pakistan was inundated by unexpected  \n. A vicious storm bringing rain, snow and floods just struck the Middle East. And in the United States, scientists confirmed this week what people could have figured out simply by going outside:  \n since records began.         \n\n\u201cEach year we have extreme weather, but it\u2019s unusual to have so many extreme events around the world at once,\u201d said Omar Baddour, chief of the data management applications division at the World Meteorological Organization, in Geneva. \u201cThe heat wave in Australia; the flooding in the U.K., and most recently the flooding and extensive snowstorm in the Middle East \u2014 it\u2019s already a big year in terms of extreme weather calamity.\u201d         \n\nSuch events are increasing in intensity as well as frequency, Mr. Baddour said, a sign that climate change is not just about rising temperatures, but also about intense, unpleasant, anomalous weather of all kinds.         \n\nHere in Britain, people are used to thinking of rain as the wallpaper on life\u2019s computer screen \u2014 an omnipresent, almost comforting background presence. But even the hardiest citizen was rattled by the near-biblical fierceness of the rains that bucketed down, and the floods that followed, three different times in 2012.         \n\nRescuers plucked people by boat from their swamped homes in St. Asaph, North Wales. Whole areas of the country were cut off when roads and train tracks were inundated at Christmas. In Mevagissey, Cornwall, a pub owner closed his business for good after it flooded 11 times in two months.         \n\nIt was no anomaly: the floods of 2012 followed the floods of 2007 and also the floods of 2009, which all told have resulted in nearly $6.5 billion in insurance payouts. The Met Office, Britain\u2019s weather service, declared 2012 the wettest year in England, and the second-wettest in Britain as a whole, since records began more than 100 years ago. Four of the five wettest years in the last century have come in the past decade (the fifth was in 1954).         \n\nThe biggest change, said Charles Powell, a spokesman for the Met Office, is the frequency in Britain of \u201cextreme weather events\u201d \u2014 defined as rainfall reaching the top 1 percent of the average amount for that time of year. Fifty years ago, such episodes used to happen every 100 days; now they happen every 70 days, he said.         \n\nThe same thing is true in Australia, where bush fires are raging across Tasmania and the current heat wave has come after two of the country\u2019s wettest years ever. On Tuesday, Sydney experienced its fifth-hottest day since records began in 1910, with the temperature climbing to 108.1 degrees. The first eight days of 2013 were among the 20 hottest on record.         \n\nEvery decade since the 1950s has been hotter in Australia than the one before, said Mark Stafford Smith, science director of the Climate Adaptation Flagship at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization.         \n\nTo the north, the extremes have swung the other way, with a band of cold settling across Russia and Northern Europe, bringing thick snow and howling winds to Stockholm, Helsinki and Moscow. (Incongruously, there were also severe snowstorms in Sicily and southern Italy for the first time since  \n; in December, tornadoes and waterspouts struck the Italian coast.)         \n\nIn Siberia, thousands of people were left without heat when natural gas liquefied in its pipes and water mains burst. Officials canceled bus transportation between cities for fear that roadside breakdowns could lead to deaths from exposure, and motorists were advised not to venture far afield except in columns of two or three cars. In Altai, to the east, traffic officials warned drivers not to use poor-quality diesel, saying that it could become viscous in the cold and clog fuel lines.         \n\nMeanwhile, China is enduring its worst winter in recent memory, with frigid temperatures recorded in Harbin, in the northeast. In the western region of Xinjiang, more than 1,000 houses collapsed under a relentless onslaught of snow, while in Inner Mongolia, 180,000 livestock froze to death. The cold has wreaked havoc with crops, sending the price of vegetables soaring.         \n\nWay down in South America, energy analysts say that Brazil may face electricity rationing for the first time since 2002, as a heat wave and a lack of rain deplete the reservoirs for  \n plants. The summer has been punishingly hot. The temperature in Rio de Janeiro climbed to 109.8 degrees on Dec. 26, the city\u2019s highest temperature since official records began in 1915.
