{"headline": "A Yellow Card, Then Unfathomable Violence, in Brazil", "body": "\nPIO XII, Brazil \u2014 It was midafternoon that Sunday when Ot\u00e1vio Jord\u00e3o da Silva Cantanhede left on his bike to play pickup soccer. His father said he did not see him tuck a knife into his shorts or slide a blade into his backpack.         \n\nAt 19, short and thin, Cantanhede rode through the remote town in northeastern Brazil with his younger brother George. They headed for the neighborhood of Centro do Meio, a few miles away down a red dirt road.         \n\nThe lumpy soccer field had wooden goal posts with no nets. Grass had worn bare in spots, exposing the sandy soil. Informal matches were played there. One team usually wore shirts, while the other played bare chested. No bleachers or scoreboard obstructed the verdant backdrop of palm trees and banana trees and mango trees that gave wide shade to stray dogs.         \n\nDuring the first half, Cantanhede played on defense. Then he twisted his ankle or his knee and became the referee. It was June 30. That same day, 1,300 miles to the south in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\u2019s national team defeated Spain to win the Confederations Cup, a tuneup for the 2014 World Cup. Not until a week later would the world learn what brutality had occurred in Centro do Meio.         \n\nFifteen or 20 minutes into the second half, Cantanhede ejected a player named Josemir Santos Abreu, 30, a friend and sometimes teammate who in an instant became an enemy. A yellow-card warning escalated into a red-card send-off, an argument, a lethal fight.         \n\nCantanhede twice stabbed Abreu, who died by the time he reached the nearby hospital. In retaliation, the police said, Cantanhede was set upon by at least four of Abreu\u2019s friends, whose bleakest impulses were fueled by alcohol, drugs and a crowd that stoked the violence the way wind stokes a fire. Cantanhede was tied up, smashed in the face with a bottle of cheap sugarcane liquor, pummeled with a wooden stake, run over by a motorcycle and stabbed in the throat, the police said. The moment of death remained uncertain. What came before did not stop another of the accused from a gruesome completion.         \n\nGraphic images taken by hospital workers showed that Cantanhede\u2019s lower legs were cut off and left beside him like prostheses. His right arm and left wrist remained attached by strips of skin. He was decapitated and his head was placed on a wooden fence post across the road from the field.         \n\n\u201cIn the first moment, I didn\u2019t believe it happened,\u201d said Valter Costa dos Santos, the regional police chief and lead investigator in the case. \u201cI didn\u2019t think human beings had such perverseness to do this.\u201d         \n\nFor a week the story incubated in isolation. Then the news media picked it up, and it spread like a contagion. Two men lay in separate cemeteries beneath mounds of dirt and melted candles. A neighborhood invisible even in Brazil became visible to the world for the darkest inclinations.         \n\nPeople rushed to give meaning to the incomprehensible, to assign logic to the irrational. The killings were widely reported as an extreme example of soccer violence in Brazil, a grisly contradiction to joga bonito, to play beautifully, as the country prepared to host the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics.         \n\nThe truth seemed far more complicated. It involved two murder victims \u2014 a distressed teenager and an older friend with a temper \u2014 and interior Brazil\u2019s wider culture of knives and revenge. It touched on hopelessness and rage born of poverty and inequality, and mistrust that seethed from inadequate policing and uneven access to justice. When formal justice seemed weak and unresponsive to one killing, another score was settled as scores have long been settled in this region of Brazil \u2014 with private justice, bloodshed trumped by bloodshed.         \nVillagers played soccer at the field in Centro do Meio, Brazil, where an argument escalated into a lethal fight in June. \n\nResidents of Centro do Meio felt ashamed. The world did not know a humble community, only what had been described as a mob. Even some in nearby neighborhoods thought Centro do Meio was cursed.         \n\nWhen Livanete Santos, 13, told her schoolmates in Pio XII where she lived, some of the children made the sign of the cross.         \n\n\u201cThey were protecting themselves from us,\u201d Santos said.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/sports/soccer/a-yellow-card-then-unfathomable-violence-in-brazil.html", "date": "2013-10-31", "description": "Hopelessness, rage that grew from poverty and inequality, and Brazil\u2019s wider culture of knives and revenge may have played a part in a confrontation on a soccer field that turned gruesome."}
