{"headline": "Senate Discord Drains Power of Finance Chief", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 After the Reagan landslide of 1980 swept Bob Dole into the chairmanship of the Senate Finance Committee, Mr. Dole was not sure how to break the news to Russell B. Long, the Louisiana Democrat who had presided over the panel with unquestioned authority for 15 years.         \n\n\u201cWho is going to tell Russell?\u201d asked an anxious Mr. Dole.         \n\nThat the incoming chairman of the Finance Committee was nervous about approaching the deposed head speaks volumes about the power vested in that position and the men who have held it.         \n\nThe imminent departure of Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, from both the Senate and the committee has put a new focus on the panel and the chairmanship, which has declined in stature and influence compared with the vital role it played in the Senate almost from the beginning. Without a shift in the power structure of the Senate, it appears likely the next committee leader will have only a fraction of the clout of those in the past.         \n\nIn addition to Mr. Long, the esteemed chairmanship was the domain of such Senate forces as Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, Mr. Dole of Kansas and Bob Packwood of Oregon (before his fall in a sexual misconduct scandal). Many other prominent Senate figures also held the gavel over the centuries.         \n\nThe committee handles all tax and revenue legislation, trade and tariffs; oversees Social Security and Medicare; and vets crucial nominations like the top jobs at the Departments of Treasury and Health and Human Services.         \n\nWhen President Lyndon B. Johnson yearned to cut taxes in 1964, he knew he could not succeed without tirelessly wooing Senator Harry Byrd of Virginia, the Democrat who held the Finance Committee job for a decade before Mr. Long.         \n\n\u201cAs powerful as Lyndon Johnson was, he was powerful because he knew how to play the committee chairs,\u201d said Richard A. Baker, a former Senate historian.         \n\nMr. Baker says he sees power ebbing from the Finance Committee because of a consolidation of control in the offices of the floor leaders. That is where most of the main decisions on policy and legislative priorities are made these days \u2014 in suites on the second floor of the Capitol rather than in the committee rooms of the Senate office buildings.         \n\n\u201cIt has been a gradual accretion through the \u201880s and \u201890s in the direction of the floor leader,\u201d said Mr. Baker, a co-author of the book \u201cThe American Senate: An Insider\u2019s History.\u201d         \n\nWhile all the committees have surrendered influence in recent years, the Finance Committee had typically been considered above all others since its creation in the early 1800s.         \n\n\u201cThe Finance Committee is second to none in the Senate in terms of the legislative responsibilities entrusted to it,\u201d declared  \n commissioned by Mr. Dole when he became chairman.         \n\nWhen a special committee led by Senator John F. Kennedy was formed in 1959 to select five outstanding senators through history, all five \u2014 Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, John C. Calhoun, Robert M. La Follette Sr. and Robert A. Taft \u2014 had served on the committee and Webster, Clay and Calhoun were chairmen.         \n\nThe committee has traditionally been viewed as a microcosm of the Senate, with the notion that a measure that could clear the Finance Committee with a bipartisan majority stood a solid chance of success in the Senate because members of the panel were representative of the whole Senate.         \n\nThe committee also had a deep history of working in a bipartisan fashion to push its major legislation. But with the decline of the spirit of bipartisanship and trust between members of the Senate, some of the power of the Finance Committee and its chairman has dissipated with it.         \n\n\u201cYou have an eclectic mix of people on the committee who have become less and less bipartisan,\u201d said Tom Daschle, the former Democratic Senate leader, who also served on the committee. \u201cThe environment is so different regardless of leadership.\u201d         \n\nAs control of the Senate \u2014 and of the committee leadership \u2014 has shifted between parties, the power of the chairman has diminished. Senate Republicans have put a six-year limit on how long a member can serve as chairman of a single committee.
