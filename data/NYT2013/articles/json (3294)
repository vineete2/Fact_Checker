{"headline": "After U.N. Vote on Sanctions, 2 Koreas Ratchet Up Threats", "body": "\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 The governments of North and South Korea escalated their hostile warnings to the highest level in years on Friday, with each threatening to annihilate the other a day after the  \n unanimously imposed tightened sanctions on the North for its nuclear test last month.         \n\n \n said it was nullifying all nonaggression agreements with South Korea, and one of its top generals claimed his country had nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles ready to blast off. South Korea said that if North Korea attacked the South with a nuclear weapon, the government of the North\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, would be \u201cerased from the earth.\u201d         \n\nIt was the most vitriolic verbal back-and-forth between the two Koreas, still technically at war, since they engaged in an artillery skirmish three years ago, and it reflected the heightened tensions that followed the Security Council\u2019s 15-to-0 vote to further penalize North Korea in response to the Feb. 12 nuclear test, its third.         \n\nThe mutual warnings also represented a clash of nerves between the young North Korean leader, who is building his credentials as head of his militaristic country, and Park Geun-hye, South Korea\u2019s first female president, who has stressed security as her top priority.         \n\nWhile experts say North Korea does not have the technical ability to use nuclear-tipped missiles, that did not stop it from threatening to deploy them.         \n\n\u201cIf we push the button, they will blast off and their barrage will turn Washington, the stronghold of American imperialists and the nest of evil, and its followers, into a sea of fire,\u201d said Kang Pyo-yong, the vice defense minister of North Korea.         \n\nHis speech Thursday in the capital, Pyongyang, was carried Friday by the North\u2019s main party newspaper, Rodong Sinmun. On Saturday, the Foreign Ministry issued a statement repeating that the North\u2019s \u201cstatus as a nuclear state\u201d would become \u201cpermanent,\u201d and calling its nuclear arsenal the strong guarantee of its sovereignty and security.         \n\nIn the last few days, North Korea\u2019s state-run news media have carried a slew of official remarks threatening to launch \u201cpre-emptive nuclear strikes\u201d at the United States and South Korea with \u201clighter and smaller nukes,\u201d hinting that the country has built nuclear warheads small enough to mount on long-range missiles. But American and South Korean officials strongly doubt that the North has mastered that technology, despite its launching of a long-range rocket in December and  \n.         \n\nSouth Korean military officials called the remarks bluster, designed not so much to threaten Washington as to infuse the North with a sense of crisis and empowerment as Mr. Kim consolidates his grip on power and uses his country\u2019s growing confrontation with the outside world to enhance his status at home.         \n\nThe North\u2019s state media has shown tearful soldiers running into his arms or shaking their rifles overhead in jubilation during Mr. Kim\u2019s visits to their units. North Korean television reports have also shown soldiers rushing waist-deep into the ocean to see Mr. Kim off after a recent visit to a front-line island. Such scenes are not unusual in North Korea, where the state media depicts the nation\u2019s leader as a fatherlike protector and calls for unconditional adoration and obedience.         \n\nMs. Park, however, warned that with its behavior, North Korea was only hurting itself.         \n\nNorth Korea \u201cwill collapse in self-destruction if it continues to waste its resources on  \n development while its people are going hungry,\u201d she said Friday at a commission ceremony for young military officers.         \n\nAlso Friday, North Korea said it was nullifying all denuclearization agreements and cutting off the North-South hot line, in retaliation for the United Nations sanctions and the joint military exercises South Korea is staging with the United States.         \n\nThe North said this week that it considered the 1953 armistice agreement that halted the Korean War to be null and void as of Monday because of the joint military exercises. The North has threatened to terminate that agreement before, but American and South Korean military officials pointed out that legally, no party armistice can unilaterally terminate or alter its terms.         \n\nThe Americans and South Koreans were not dismissing the threat entirely. Gen. James Thurman, the American commander in charge of enforcing the armistice conditions, said in a statement: \u201cIt is concerning when any signatory to a mutual agreement makes a public statement contrary to that agreement.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/09/world/asia/north-korea-sanctions.html", "date": "2013-03-08", "description": "North Korea responded angrily to a decision to impose tightened sanctions, saying it was nullifying all nonaggression agreements with South Korea."}
