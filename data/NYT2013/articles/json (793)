{"headline": "Garment Trade Wields Power in Bangladesh", "body": "\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 In the honking, congested heart of this overcrowded capital, one glass office tower stands uniquely alone, surrounded by water, accessible by a small bridge. It is a symbol of the power of Bangladesh\u2019s garment industry, the headquarters of the country\u2019s most powerful association of factory owners. It is also illegal.         \n\nSo said the Bangladesh High Court, concluding that the land had been illegally obtained, the building had been erected without proper approvals and the location threatened a network of lakes that form the natural drainage system of the capital. The High Court called the building \u201ca scam of abysmal proportions\u201d and ordered it demolished within 90 days.         \n\nThat was two years ago. The building still stands. The case is now in a legal limbo \u2014 more proof, according to critics, of the power of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association. Members control the engine of the national economy \u2014 garment exports to the United States and Europe. Many serve in Parliament or own television stations and newspapers.         \n\nFor two decades, as Bangladesh became a garment power, now trailing only China in global clothing exports, the trade group has often seemed more like a government ministry. Known as B.G.M.E.A., the organization helps regulate and administer exports and its leaders sit on high-level government committees on labor and security issues. Industry trade groups in the United States could only imagine such a role.         \n\nBut the April  \n, which killed more than 1,100 people, has placed the entire global supply chain that delivers clothes from Bangladeshi factories to Western consumers under scrutiny. And the quasi-official garment group, in the eyes of its critics, presents a major conflict of interest at the center of Bangladesh\u2019s troubles and is a big part of the systemic problems that have made the country a dangerous place for garment workers.         \n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t put the fox in charge of the chickens,\u201d said Rizwana Hasan, an environmental lawyer. \u201cB.G.M.E.A. has no regulatory authority under the laws of the country. It\u2019s a clubhouse of the garment industry.\u201d         \n\nBangladesh is working to restore the garment industry\u2019s credibility after last month\u2019s decision by the Obama administration to  \n. The European Union is also considering penalties. Bangladesh has responded by  \n and pledging to inspect the structural safety and legal compliance of the nation\u2019s 5,000 garment factories.         \n\nIn both instances, the garment group\u2019s interests were well represented. It has hired a team of engineers and is helping oversee the post-Rana Plaza factory inspections \u2014 even as the High Court cited the group for a litany of violations on its own headquarters. Meanwhile, the trade group brought its influence to bear in a lobbying campaign as Parliament amended the labor laws this month.         \n\nBangladeshi officials promised to overhaul their labor laws, which fall short of standards defined by the International Labor Organization and tend to suppress unions, contributing to safety problems, labor advocates say. But the results of the overhaul were less significant, especially for the garment industry. One amendment required that industries create profit-sharing programs for workers. But exporting industries, notably the garment sector, were exempted.         \n\nRestrictions on labor organizing were eased, but far from fully lifted. The new law requires that 30 percent of factory workers must sign petitions to form a union, a telling obstacle given that many factories have thousands of employees and have few places to hold meetings and organize.         \n\n\u201cBangladesh had a golden opportunity,\u201d said Roy Ramesh Chandra, a labor leader, who said that the political influence of factory owners diluted some of the amendments. \u201cThe employers have tremendous influence.\u201d         \n\nBusiness interests dominate Bangladesh\u2019s Parliament. Of its 300 members, an estimated 60 percent are involved in industry or business. Analysts say 31 members, or 10 percent of the country\u2019s national legislators, directly own garment factories, while others have indirect financial interests in the industry.
