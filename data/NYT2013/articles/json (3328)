{"headline": "Who Made Those Hot Wheels?", "body": "\n\u201cHere was this car you always dreamed about, and you can buy it for a dollar,\u201d says Larry Wood, who began designing Hot Wheels toys in 1969. Wood arrived at Mattel just a few years after Elliot Handler, the co-founder of the company, who died in 2011, decided to sell a miniature customized muscle car to kids. At that time, gearheads and backyard mechanics paraded around in hot rods that looked as if they\u2019d come from a child\u2019s fevered imagination. Painted in lollipop colors, the cars sprouted chrome-plated wings made out of exhaust pipes; they belched and roared and reared up on their haunches.         \n\nIn 1968, Mattel introduced a line of tiny dragsters with mag wheels, bubble windshields and names like Beatnik Bandit. Wood remembers watching Handler crawling on the floor, piecing together orange plastic tracks to test the cars. In those days, Barbie was queen. \u201cHot Wheels was his baby,\u201d Wood says. Of his time at Mattel in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Wood recalls that he \u201cwas basically alone, doing Hot Wheels for 15 years. And then we noticed it going crazy when the fathers who grew up with Hot Wheels started buying cars for their sons. That\u2019s when all hell broke loose, and we had to hire more designers.\u201d These days, Wood signs autographs at Hot Wheels conventions where collectors pay thousands of dollars for, say, a Beach Bomb VW bus with tiny surfboards sticking out of the back. Wood conceived many of these collector items, but, he says, \u201cthe fanatics know more about these cars than I do.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n My parents owned more than 10,000 items related to cars. I have the gene. Six months after I started collecting Hot Wheels, I read about a rare car being sold \u2014 the pink rear-loader Beach Bomb.         \n\n \n Well, I can\u2019t say. But I can tell you it was in the neighborhood of $72,000.         \n\n \n Yes, at his Malibu house. I took him to his first Hot Wheels convention. He didn\u2019t know they existed. In the last years of his life, he traveled with his wife to Barbie conventions; he would be the husband schlepping along. But he got a standing ovation from the Hot Wheels people.         \n\n \n Mr. Handler told me that the greatest toys had \u201cplayability.\u201d Mattel had psychologists watch kids play through one-way glass. Matchbox cars, if you pushed them, would only go a few inches. Hot Wheels would go several feet.
