{"headline": "Blood and Chaos Prevail in Egypt, Testing Control", "body": "\nCAIRO \u2014 Egypt erupted into violent chaos on Friday, raising doubts about the new authorities\u2019 capacity to maintain order, as Islamists and other opponents of last month\u2019s military takeover fought security forces and their civilian allies in street battles across the capital and other cities.         \n\nThe country seemed to descend into anarchy. Terrified protesters caught in a cross-fire jumped or fell from an overpass in a panicked effort to escape. A gunfight erupted on the doorstep of a Four Seasons hotel. Men wielding guns and machetes \u2014 some backing the Islamists, others police supporters in civilian clothes, others simply criminals \u2014 roamed the streets of the capital and other cities, and it was often impossible to tell friend from foe.         \n\nNews reports put the civilian death toll for Friday at well over 100, which would bring the total since Wednesday to nearly 750. Health Ministry officials said Friday\u2019s civilian toll was 27, but late Friday afternoon more than 30 uncounted corpses were seen at a field hospital in a mosque near the center of the fighting, in Cairo\u2019s Ramses Square.         \n\nDefying a 7 p.m. curfew, antagonists battled there into the night, lit by an unchecked fire that consumed a nearby office building. The military-appointed government issued a statement declaring that the military, the police and the people were \u201cstanding together in the face of the treacherous terrorist scheme against Egypt of the Brotherhood organization.\u201d But the extent of the mayhem cast doubt on its ability to deliver on its central promise of restoring order and security.         \n\nFrance and Germany called for an emergency meeting of European foreign ministers to respond to Egypt\u2019s violence. \u201cThe toll of death and injury is shocking,\u201d said Catherine Aston, the top diplomat for the European Union. \u201cResponsibility for this tragedy weighs heavily on the interim government, as well as on the wider political leadership in the country.\u201d         \n\nJust two days earlier, the police had routed thousands of protesters from sit-ins in support of the ousted president, Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, killing several hundred. The government suspended legal protections against arbitrary police action and authorized security forces to kill anyone who threatened a public facility.         \n\nFor many on Friday, however, shock at the scale of the bloodshed began to outweigh the threats. The violence started soon after noon prayers, as thousands of Islamists marched in a last defense against a return to the era of political exclusion, imprisonment and torture they endured under 60 years of military-backed dictatorship.         \n\nFor the first time since the president\u2019s removal six weeks ago, some non-Islamists stood with the Morsi supporters, sometimes risking their own lives as well.         \n\n\u201cWhere are we going with this?\u201d one young man asked another watching at the edge of the Ramses Square battle. \u201cAre we just going to fight one another endlessly?\u201d         \n\nHis friend replied that he had protested against President Morsi, and that the police had protected him from threats. But now they were killing the Islamists, he said.         \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re Egyptian, too,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy were we safe while they\u2019re being killed by the police?\u201d         \n\nThere was no sign that the chaos would end anytime soon. The Muslim Brotherhood, the main Islamist group behind Mr. Morsi, called for similar marches every day for the next week, and vowed to hold daily, nonviolent marches to Ramses Square for morning and evening prayers, declaring, in the words of Thomas Jefferson, that the bloodshed \u201cirrigates the tree of liberty in Egypt.\u201d         \n\nAs they have since the ouster of Mr. Morsi, state and private news media cheered on the battle against the Brotherhood. \u201cEgypt is fighting terrorism,\u201d a deep voice intoned periodically over Egyptian state radio throughout the day; a similar slogan in English and Arabic flashed on state television.
