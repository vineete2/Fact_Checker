Snowden, the fugitive American intelligence contractor, from finding refuge in Latin America, where three left-leaning governments that make defying Washington a hallmark of their foreign policies have publicly vowed to take him in.         \n\nVice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. took the unusual step of telephoning President Rafael Correa of Ecuador to urge him not to give asylum to Mr. Snowden. Senior State Department officials have also pushed Venezuela, one of the three countries offering to shelter him, with both sides keenly aware that hopes for better ties and an exchange of ambassadors after years of tension could be on the line.         \n\nAnd all across the region, American embassies have communicated Washington\u2019s message that letting Mr. Snowden into Latin America, even if he shows up unexpectedly, would have lasting consequences.         \n\n\u201cThere is not a country in the hemisphere whose government does not understand our position at this point,\u201d a senior State Department official focusing on the matter said recently, adding that helping Mr. Snowden \u201cwould put relations in a very bad place for a long time to come.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIf someone thinks things would go away, it won\u2019t be the case,\u201d the official said.         \n\nBut Washington is finding that its leverage in Latin America is limited just when it needs it most, a reflection of how a region that was once a broad zone of American power has become increasingly confident in its ability to act independently.         \n\n\u201cOur influence in the hemisphere is diminishing,\u201d said Bill Richardson, a former American ambassador to the United Nations who visited Venezuela this year as a representative of the Organization of American States. \u201cIt\u2019s important that the Obama administration and Secretary of State Kerry devote more time to the region and buttress our relationship with some of the moderate countries, like Mexico and Colombia and Brazil and Peru, to resist that anti-U.S. movement.\u201d         \n\nAt the same time, Mr. Richardson said, there should be efforts to build bridges to countries antagonistic to the United States.         \n\nThe countries offering to take in Mr. Snowden \u2014 Venezuela, Nicaragua and Bolivia \u2014 belong to a bloc of governments engaged in a constant war of words with the United States. Venezuela and Bolivia have expelled American ambassadors and other officials, and in a television interview this week Venezuela\u2019s foreign minister openly shrugged off the American pressure campaign.         \n\n\u201cThe State Department and the government of the United States should know that Venezuela learned a long time ago and defeated pressures from any part of the world,\u201d the minister, El\u00edas Jaua, said.         \n\nThe United States has continued to reach out to Venezuela. Roberta S. Jacobson, assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, repeated the Obama administration\u2019s position on Mr. Snowden this week in a phone call with the charg\u00e9 d'\u00e1ffaires of the Venezuelan Embassy in Washington, a government official said.         \n\nIn some cases, the diplomatic effort seems to have paid off. Ecuador at one point appeared eager to grant Mr. Snowden refuge, but it gradually seemed to back off, saying that it could not even consider his request for asylum unless he was in the country or in one of its embassies abroad.         \n\nThe call from Mr. Biden brought an uncharacteristically warm response from Mr. Correa, who often rails against what he sees as excessive American influence in the region. In an interview, he praised Mr. Biden as being cordial, saying the vice president asked him not to grant asylum and explained that \u201cit could greatly deteriorate relations, but without any kind of threat, just presenting the importance that the Snowden case has for them.\u201d         \n\nBy contrast, Mr. Correa bristled at what he viewed as threats by American senators who vowed to end trade preferences on some Ecuadorean goods if his country sheltered Mr. Snowden. One group of preferences expires at the end of the month unless renewed by Congress, but Ecuador has sought separate White House approval for duty-free treatment for roses, broccoli and artichokes. The White House said last week it was postponing a decision.         \n\nMr. Snowden\u2019s leaks sometimes appear timed to coincide with where he is at the moment or hopes to go. When he was hiding out in Hong Kong,  \n about American spying in China.
