{"headline": "Where the Pho Is a Sure Thing", "body": "\nATLANTIC CITY \u2014 New Yorkers have been known to grouse about the Vietnamese food in their city. Many have tasted mind-numbingly good pho in places like Houston, San Diego and Falls Church, Va. (national hot spots of Viet cuisine), yet when they encounter the iconic beef and rice-noodle soup at home, the flavors often seem pallid and unknit.         \n\nThere\u2019s no need to hop onto a plane, though. A scant 125 miles away, in and around this gambling mecca, are a clutch of Vietnamese cafes that arguably rank among the nation\u2019s most authentic, where the steaming bowls of pho have the kind of flavors that can make connoisseurs of the dish leap up from their plastic chairs with pleasure.         \n\nTake the pho dac biet at Hu Tieu Mien Tay. This modest cafe owned by Ha and Thomas Vu \u2014 its neon-lighted walls hung with Chinese paintings of raptors soaring over sunlit cliffs \u2014 is deep within the food court of Asian Supermarket in Pleasantville, N.J., just across a bay from Atlantic City. At lunch the place is packed, not just with Vietnamese, but with working-class patrons of every stripe, who eat silently save for the loud sound of slurping.         \n\nThe pho is a favorite with this crowd, based on a deeply amber beef broth glittering with tiny droplets of oil. The first flavor to hit the tongue is star anise, followed in quick succession by scallions, cilantro, garlic, onions, charred ginger and perhaps a touch of chicken in the long-boiled broth. Last to unfold is pungent Chinese celery, an ingredient that Vietnamese restaurants in New York usually omit. In the depths is a hoard of meats, including raw steak sliced razor-thin \u2014 the bright pink color fading as you watch \u2014 along with bumpy white tripe, gobs of gluey tendon and tender brisket like something a Jewish mother might make.         \n\nBut as good as the soup already is, you are encouraged to customize it, first from a plate heaped with bean sprouts, sliced jalape\u00f1os, holy basil, lime wedges and the elongated herb called Vietnamese cilantro. Finally, there is a caddy of a dozen jarred and bottled condiments, some obviously homemade, including fish sauce, a red-chile pur\u00e9e, a caramel-like hoisin and (in an apparent tip of the hat to French colonialists) red wine vinegar.         \n\nHow did such serious pho come to settle here?         \n\nLien Pham, the chef and owner of Little Saigon, recounted how she started Atlantic City\u2019s first Vietnamese restaurant, far from the gambling haunts on a side street that has become the center of a Vietnamese neighborhood. \u201cI came to Atlantic City in the 1980s to take a job as a dealer in one of the casinos,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were many Vietnamese casino employees. One day my friends asked, \u2018Why don\u2019t you start a restaurant?\u2019 And I did.\u201d         \n\nDecorated with banks of customer snapshots and framed articles from local publications, Ms. Pham\u2019s small cafe is the best known of the Vietnamese restaurants, and the one most likely to attract random beachgoers, vacationers and gamblers. Among her specialties are examples of what might be called French-Indochinese haute cuisine, including tom ram man (succulent grilled shrimp cooked in caramel sauce in a clay pot, tendered with a sprig of fresh mint) and bo xa luc lac (cubes of saut\u00e9ed beefsteak coated with black pepper, served with lettuce and radicchio for wrapping).         \n\nLittle Saigon opened in 1991, and now there are a half-dozen Vietnamese restaurants on the city\u2019s slender barrier island and in adjacent Egg Harbor Township. The 2010 census counted about 1,400 residents of Vietnamese descent in Atlantic City, a municipality with a population of only 40,000, and there is certainly a sizable number in the surrounding area. Over the last two decades, the casinos have worked to attract Vietnamese and Chinese customers, partly through Asian-themed gambling areas, foreign-language entertainment extravaganzas and small, semi-secret noodle bars where patrons can quickly indulge in Asian staples before returning to their games.
