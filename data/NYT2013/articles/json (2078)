{"headline": "Reconciling a Sport\u2019s Violent Appeal as a Fighter Lies in a Coma", "body": "\nThree men sat inside a Manhattan diner. Their fighter, the Russian heavyweight Magomed Abdusalamov, remained in a medically induced coma at Roosevelt Hospital, across the street.         \n\n\u201cOne week ago, the doctors say he has 100 percent chance to die,\u201d his manager, Boris Grinberg, said 10 days after Abdusalamov entered the ring. Since then, his condition has improved, and there is talk of bringing him out of the coma, his representatives said.         \n\nAbdusalamov fought Mike Perez at the Theater at Madison Square Garden on Nov. 2. He expected a tough bout, perhaps even a bloody one, the kind of televised fight that could propel him to greater heights.         \n\nThe fight lasted 10 rounds, and Abdusalamov took the worst of the exchanges. Blood dripped from his nose and from cuts above his left eyelid. He fought most of the match with a broken hand. He kept asking his team, in Russian, how his face looked.         \n\nHis promoter, Sampson Lewkowicz, said in the diner that he considered trying to stop the fight in the eighth round. Security stopped him.         \n\nAfter the fight, sportswriters and promoters gathered at a nearby bar and recounted the match. I was among them. The consensus: great, action-packed fight.         \n\nAt around the same time, Abdusalamov left the arena and vomited on the curb. A cab dropped Abdusalamov at the hospital. Doctors asked his brother to sign off on surgery. Abdusalamov, they said, had a half-hour to live.         \n\nA brain scan showed swelling and a blood clot. Doctors induced a coma and removed a portion of his skull. While in the coma, Abdusalamov had a stroke.         \n\nHis family set up in the intensive-care unit, where they have remained since. His brother slept on two chairs pushed together in a corner. His wife flew up from Florida with their three daughters, ages 8, 4 and 11 months. \u201cDa-Da,\u201d the youngest kept saying.         \n\nAbdusalamov\u2019s manager described him as a quiet man, \u201calways thinking about his future, about his goals.\u201d He added, \u201cHe is dying to be champion of the world.\u201d         \n\nDuring the fight, I sat 10 feet from the boxers, in the first row of the news media section. I saw Abdusalamov\u2019s face, swollen and disfigured. What a warrior, I thought. What a fight.         \n\nIn the weeks since, I have wrestled with questions over why we cover this brutal sport, in which so many combatants end up dead or neurologically impaired.         \n\nBernard Hopkins, a boxer known as The Executioner, talked it over with me. He discussed the opportunities boxing offered, the prospect for the kind of fortune and fame that he had enjoyed. He elaborated on the risks involved, and gladiatorial sacrifice made for the entertainment of others. He could not explain to an outsider why boxers box, or why a Russian heavyweight lay unconscious in a Manhattan hospital. But he tried.         \n\nHopkins remembered visiting a fellow boxer, Leavander Johnson, as he lay in a coma after emergency brain surgery after a title fight gone wrong. Hopkins stood on one side of the bed. Oscar De La Hoya, a man Hopkins once leveled with a devastating body blow, stood on the other. They prayed, and when they lifted their heads, their eyes met.         \n\n\u201cMan,\u201d Hopkins said he told De La Hoya, \u201csee what we put our bodies through.\u201d         \n\nJohnson died, and yet neither man considered retirement. Hopkins, 48, fought last month.         \n\nBoxing, Hopkins says, saved his life.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t expect you to understand,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, how many people go to work and say, literally say, \u2018I might die tonight.\u2019 But that\u2019s boxing. Whenever there\u2019s a fight, there\u2019s a possibility of death.\u201d         \n\nHopkins could not explain why boxers box, but since they do, he wants to help.         \n\nHe tells fighters to take out insurance, above what promoters are required to by commissions, which varies from state to state. He says that networks and promoters should take 3 percent of the gross revenue for televised and pay-per-view events and start a fund for boxers who incur severe injuries or worse.
