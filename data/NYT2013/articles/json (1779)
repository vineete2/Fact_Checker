Hours later, the mall\u2019s gleaming floors were smeared with blood as police officers dashed through the corpse-strewn corridors, trying to find the assailants.         \n\nA standoff with the attackers, who were reported to be heavily armed and holding an unknown number of hostages, continued as the sun rose on Sunday.         \n\nThe mall, called Westgate, is a symbol of Kenya\u2019s rising prosperity, an impressive five-story building where Kenyans can buy expensive cups of frozen yogurt and plates of sushi. On Saturdays, it is especially crowded, and American officials have long warned that Nairobi\u2019s malls were ripe targets for terrorists, especially Westgate, because a cafe on the ground floor, right off the street, is owned by Israelis.         \n\nFred Ngoga Gateretse, an official with the African Union, was having coffee at that cafe around noon when he heard two deafening blasts. He cowered on the floor and watched eight gunmen with scarves twisted over their faces firing at shoppers and then up at Kenyan police officers who were shooting down from a balcony as panicked shoppers dashed for cover. \u201cBelieve me, these guys were good shooters,\u201d Mr. Gateretse said. \u201cYou could tell they were trained.\u201d         \n\nSeveral witnesses said the attackers had shouted for Muslims to run away while they picked off other shoppers, executing them one by one. The mall, one of Nairobi\u2019s most luxurious, with glass elevators and some of the most expensive shops in town, is also popular with expatriates. It has served as the place for a power lunch, to catch a movie, to bring children for ice cream.         \n\nFour Americans were believed to have been injured in the attack, American officials said, and none were reported killed. Secretary of State John Kerry, who called the attack \u201ca heartbreaking reminder that there exists unspeakable evil in our world,\u201d said the wife of a local employee of the American government was among the dead. Two Canadians, one of them a diplomat based in Nairobi, and two French citizens were killed, their governments said.         \n\nA confidential United Nations security report on Saturday described the attack as \u201ca complex, two-pronged assault\u201d with two squads of gunmen dashing into the mall from different floors at the same time and opening fire.         \n\nThe Shabab, an Islamist militant group based in Somalia, took responsibility for the attack, saying it was revenge for Kenya\u2019s military operations in Somalia, which began nearly two years ago. \u201cKenya will not get peace unless they pull their military out of Somalia,\u201d said Ali Mohamoud Rage, the Shabab\u2019s spokesman, in a radio address. The Shabab also sent out a barrage of buoyant Twitter messages, bragging about the prowess of their fighters before Twitter abruptly suspended the account late Saturday. Later, a new one was set up.         \n\nKenya\u2019s president, Uhuru Kenyatta, called the terrorists cowards and said Kenya would remain \u201cas brave and invincible as the lions on our coat of arms.\u201d He also sounded a somber note, pleading with Kenyans to give blood , and said he had lost \u201cvery close family members in this attack,\u201d though he did not specify further.         \n\nIn addition to the 39 people killed, who included women and children, Mr. Kenyatta said, more than 150 were wounded. Government officials said the wounded ranged in age from 2 to 78.         \n\nBy Saturday night, Kenyan commandos had cornered several of the assailants on the third floor of the mall, witnesses said. Western officials said they expected that the assailants would fight to the death, though the Kenyan news media reported that one wounded gunman had been captured and died in a hospital. Several witnesses also said one of the assailants was a woman.         \n\nThroughout the day, as the police cleared sections of the mall, terrified shoppers emerged with their hands up and collapsed in each other\u2019s arms.         \n\nEarly Sunday, the government said that the mall\u2019s upper levels had been secured and the gunmen contained in one place, but that hostages remained in several locations.         \n\nWitnesses described attackers using AK-47 and G-3 assault rifles and throwing grenades.         \n\nVivian Atieno, 26, who works on the first floor of the mall, described \u201cintense shooting,\u201d starting around 11 a.m., before she escaped through a fire exit.
