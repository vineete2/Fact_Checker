{"headline": "Decoding a 44-Year-Old Horoscope", "body": "\nThe black folder had a cardboard, cartoon fish stapled to the front cover, indicating the birth sign: Pisces. Inside was an eight-page, all-italics work-up on me \u2014 the planets, my innate strengths and weaknesses. Cora Sitrusis of Cora Sitrusis\u2019 School of Astrology Inc. had included instructions that were at times underlined (impress upon him the reason he must master such things as multiplication tables); in all caps (the horoscope shows TENDENCIES); and, very rarely, underlined  \n in all caps (ONCE HE LEARNS, HE NEVER FORGETS!). The horoscope was dated June 9, 1969. I was nearly 3 months old.         \n\nI am the only child of parents who lived in a retrofitted chicken coop and drove a flowery VW bug they painted themselves, so it came as no great surprise that one of their friends commissioned the horoscope and gave it to them. Four decades later, I wound up with it as well as some other old things \u2014 some baby shoes; a tiny white T-shirt with the logo of my birth, \u201cAn M&J production\u201d (yes, my birth had a logo).         \n\nI thought the horoscope looked interesting but put it aside. When I finally cracked it open two years later, I couldn\u2019t say why. The pages, fronted by a clear, acetate sheet, were still crisp and white. I took a closer look at Cora\u2019s logo, a man in a tunic and sash, holding a scroll, encircled by the 12 signs of the Zodiac.         \n\n\u201cEarthy Taurus enters Cameron\u2019s IXth House, the House of the Higher Mind and Adventure, at 6 degrees. Even though he may appear slow in grasping the fundamentals of knowledge, do not worry, since this placement augurs this.\u201d         \n\nAs a child I often got both legs stuck in the same hole when trying to put on underwear. I melted down at my birthday party \u201csuitcase race\u201d \u2014 changing outfits was a timed event \u2014 locking myself in my room.         \n\n\u201cSlow in grasping the fundamentals\u201d is my wife\u2019s favorite part. I struggle with instructions. I\u2019m easily lost. On the subject of history, our 10-year-old daughter estimates I\u2019m the fifth-most-informed member of the family, behind my wife, my daughter and Swimmy and Goldie, the goldfish. Then again, our darling daughter isn\u2019t one to talk \u2014 she\u2019s a Pisces, too.         \n\n\u201cFiery Aries is positioned in this VIIth House. Cameron will want to take the lead in all partnerships, and he should be able to do so, without much trouble, as long as he does not rush headlong into projects without thinking them through.\u201d         \n\nIn Cub Scouts, my friend Gary and I made our Pinewood Derby cars together \u2014 alas, neglecting to add ball bearings to the wheels. My car shot into the lead as it screamed down the ramp but stopped on the straightaway as if it had hit a patch of tar. I stormed out of the gymnasium and sat in the dark \u2014 \u201cif frustrated too much, he will be capable of reacting very strongly\u201d \u2014 the fog lifting only when Gary came out minutes later, laughing hysterically, for of course his car had done the same.         \n\nAs an adult, I quit a job at a well-known magazine to rush headlong to a not-well-known but promising start-up that published 12 issues before folding.         \n\n\u201cCameron will face adversity with courage and fortitude; and, since Venus, the Planet of Love, and Saturn, the Planet of Restriction, are placed in conjunction in this VIIIth House, he must learn the lessons of patience and self-denial.\u201d         \n\nCollege was a self-denial-free zone. Even now, I buy too many shoes. When I recently contacted a novelist to pass along my compliments and ask how long it had taken to write the book, and he wrote back, \u201cThanks \u2014 about 10 years,\u201d I had to re-evaluate plans to write my own best seller on a three-week vacation.         \n\nWhy was I that kid? Why am I this man? Cora listed my gem (amethyst), flowers (water lily, lotus, tuberose), friends and companions (Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn). My wife is a Capricorn by just a few days, and I breathed a surprising sigh of relief.         \n\nThe horoscope started as just another off-the-wall relic of my parents\u2019 past \u2014 like the stories about naked gardening and the icky poison-ivy cautionary tale \u2014 but I saw too much of myself in its pages to continue to classify it as such. I suppose that makes me a believer, if not a BELIEVER. But then again, it could just be the Fiery Aries in me, rushing headlong into things before thinking them through.
