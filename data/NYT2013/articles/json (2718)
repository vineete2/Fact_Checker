{"headline": "Boss\u2019s Kindness Repaid With a Burst of Violence", "body": "\nIt was at church where John Choi met the man accused of shooting him.         \n\nSang Ho Kim, 63, was out of work, drinking too much and generally lost. He had been arrested several times, including for driving while intoxicated. He had left his first wife in South Korea, married, divorced and married again. Nothing he did seemed to work out the way he wanted and, often, he blamed those around him for his failures.         \n\nMr. Choi, 68, arrived in New York from Seoul, penniless, four decades ago. His first job was selling wigs for Jewish women in Herald Square and, because his boss learned that he was the only employee not skimming profits, he was promoted. He saved up and bought a deli, then a carwash. Eventually he and his wife, Christine, 67, started  \n, a business selling energy-efficient LED light fixtures.         \n\nA year ago, after they met at the Hyo Shin Bible Presbyterian Church in Queens, Mr. Choi offered Mr. Kim a job. More than a job, it was a chance to get his life back on track.         \n\nBut what started with an act of Christian kindness turned into a nasty business dispute and ended in a bloody rampage.         \n\nOn Wednesday, the police say, Mr. Kim walked into Mr. Choi\u2019s office in East Garden City, N.Y., pulled a gun and shot him in the head. They said he also shot and killed Yong Jae Shin, a young man who worked at the company.         \n\nOn Thursday, at Nassau University Medical Center, his face bandaged where the bullet had entered and narrowly missed his brain, Mr. Choi had a simple message for Mr. Kim, whom the police were still seeking: Turn to Jesus. Heaven is not out of reach.         \n\nAlice Corey, 36, Mr. Choi\u2019s daughter, said such a gesture of forgiveness was a reflection of the life her father tried to lead, including his job offer to Mr. Kim.         \n\n\u201cHe had no friends, and no job, and my parents said let\u2019s give him a second chance,\u201d she said.         \n\nDavid C. Lee, a close family friend who helped found an advocacy group, Korean-American Public Affairs Committee, with Mr. Choi, said that extending a helping hand came naturally to his friend.         \n\n\u201cMr. Choi is a good Samaritan,\u201d he said. \u201cHe tries to help any person.\u201d         \n\nBut problems arose nearly as soon as Mr. Kim started working at Savenergy. He was brusque, demanding and domineering, according to other employees. Although Mr. Kim worked in the field, he showed up daily unannounced at the Garden City headquarters.         \n\nAlways dressed in a brown suit, and imposing at 6 feet 2 inches, he intimidated colleagues and demanded his commissions before deals were closed; he was also paid $37 an hour, Ms. Corey said. According to a co-worker, he once said to a colleague that if a client did not sign a contract with the company, he would \u201cthrow a grenade\u201d in the front window of the client\u2019s store.         \n\nMs. Corey, who also worked at Savenergy, said she found Mr. Kim\u2019s presence so menacing that she quit and begged her parents to fire him.         \n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Dad and Mom, I love you, I know of your Christian faith and you love to help people, but you\u2019re not Jesus Christ; don\u2019t act like Jesus Christ,\u2019\u00a0\u201d she said. \u201c\u00a0\u2018Everyone is scared of him.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nBut Mr. Choi, who started Savenergy with his wife because they believed that environmental stewardship was part of their Christian ethic, relished giving jobs to those out of work and was known for it in his church community. Yet about four months ago, Mr. Choi relented and began to cut back Mr. Kim\u2019s hours.         \n\nAnother dispute arose, this one between Mr. Kim and Mr. Shin. Mr. Kim did work at Mr. Shin\u2019s parents\u2019 home, but they believed the work was shoddy and refused payment, according to fellow employees.         \n\nWhen Mr. Kim entered the office on Wednesday, he said he was looking for Mr. Shin, who was talking with Mr. Choi.         \n\nSurrounded by his family in his hospital bed on Thursday, Mr. Choi, who was unable to speak, wrote notes praising God and the young man who had been killed. At one point he drew a picture of the shooting, showing how Mr. Kim shot him first, then Mr. Shin.         \n\nMr. Kim\u2019s family disputed the account provided by Mr. Choi and other employees. While not denying that Mr. Kim shot Mr. Choi and Mr. Shin, Mr. Kim\u2019s wife of three years and his sister both said they believed he had been ill treated at work.         \n\nAfter the shooting, Mr. Kim fled in his white Honda Pilot, setting off a manhunt that has sprawled from Long Island to Dutchess County, involving hundreds of police officers and prompting lockdowns in several normally placid suburbs. As the police searched for a man they considered armed and dangerous, they closed streets, set up roadblocks, locked down nearby schools and colleges and screened shoppers leaving a mall.         \n\nMr. Kim\u2019s car was found late on Wednesday in Putnam County, but by Thursday evening, the police were still searching for him. Law enforcement officials said the search was focused on the village of Cold Spring, where the car was found, about 60 miles north of Times Square.         \n\nThe police said the shooting was the result of a workplace dispute and identified Mr. Kim as the only suspect, releasing his photo to the news media and asking the public for their assistance.         \n\nFor the families and friends of the victims, they were left wondering how an act of kindness could end in bloodshed.         \n\n\u201cCan you believe such a good man got this much tragedy?\u201d Mr. Lee asked.         \n\nMr. Kim\u2019s sister, a resident of Syosset, N.Y., who asked not to be named, said that last week, her brother told her that he believed that files on his computer at work had been deleted so that he would not have to be paid.         \n\nThe last word she got from her brother was about two hours after the shooting, when he left a voice message. He did not express remorse, but rather, provided instructions with what to do with his body should he be found dead.         \n\n\u201cIf I die, don\u2019t put me in the land,\u201d he said, according to the sister. \u201cCremate me and put me in my mother\u2019s dying place.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/27/nyregion/police-hunt-for-suspect-in-shooting-near-long-island-mall.html", "date": "2013-09-26", "description": "John Choi, a Long Island business owner, gave a job to Sang Ho Kim, who is accused of shooting Mr. Choi and killing a co-worker."}
