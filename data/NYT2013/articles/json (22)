{"headline": "In a Soaring Homicide Rate, a Divide in Chicago", "body": "\nCHICAGO \u2014 This city\u2019s 471st homicide of 2012 happened in the middle of the day, in the middle of a crowd, on the steps of the church where the victim of homicide 463 was being eulogized. Sherman Miller, who was 21, collapsed amid gunfire not far from the idling hearse that was there to carry away James Holman, 32, shot to death a week earlier.         \n\nThe  \n at St. Columbanus Catholic Church on the South Side left neighbors fretting that no place, not even a church, felt safe any longer. \u201cIt\u2019s become the Wild Wild West,\u201d said Charles Childs Jr., who had watched from across the street as mourners screamed and scattered.         \n\nThe shooting, on Nov. 26, was one more jarring reminder of just how common killings seem to have grown on the streets of Chicago, the nation\u2019s third-largest city, where 506 homicides were reported in 2012, a 16 percent increase over the year before, even as the number of killings remained relatively steady or dropped in some cities, including New York.         \n\nBut the overall rise in killings here blurs another truth: the homicides, most of which the authorities described as gang-against-gang shootings, have not been spread evenly across this city. Instead, they have mostly taken place in neighborhoods west and south of Chicago\u2019s gleaming downtown towers.         \n\nAlready, 2013 began with  \n, two of them on the South Side. Like other cities, Chicago has long been a segregated place, richer and whiter on the North Side, and the city\u2019s troubling increase in killings has accentuated a longstanding divide.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s two different Chicagos,\u201d said the Rev. Corey B. Brooks Sr., the pastor of New Beginnings Church on the South Side, who had led the funeral service for Mr. Holman the day shots rang out, then found himself leading Mr. Miller\u2019s funeral service a week later. The authorities here have described both shootings as gang related. \u201cIf something like that had happened at the big cathedral in downtown Chicago or up north at a predominantly white church, it would still be on the news right now, it would be such a major thing going on.\u201d         \n\nMore than 80 percent of the city\u2019s homicides took place last year in only about half of Chicago\u2019s 23 police districts, largely on the city\u2019s South and West Sides. The police district that includes parts of the business district downtown reported no killings at all. And while at least one police district on the city\u2019s northern edge saw a significant increase in the rate of killings, the total number there still was dwarfed by deaths in districts on the other sides of town, and particularly in certain neighborhoods.         \n\nAlong the streets downtown and in neighborhoods on the North Side not far from Lake Michigan, some residents acknowledged that they had heard about a rise in the city\u2019s homicide rate, but said it had not affected their own sense of safety. \u201cThis area is a bit of a Garden of Eden,\u201d said Gwen Sylvain, as she walked dogs along a residential street not far from the Loop.         \n\nOthers said they rarely had reason to go to the Chicago\u2019s South or West Sides, only a few miles away, and some longtime residents said they had never once ventured to such neighborhoods. Police business on the North Side rarely seems to rise beyond an overly enthusiastic Cubs fan or a parking quibble, said Kyong Lee, who said that in the past he had, without consequence, forgotten to lock up his family\u2019s shoe repair business.         \n\nIn Back of the Yards, a South Side neighborhood near the city\u2019s old meatpacking district, the tenor was far different. Mothers spoke of keeping their children inside from the moment school ended, and businessmen of decisions to lock the front doors of their shops during business hours. \u201cI don\u2019t go out at night,\u201d said Jesse Martinez, who recalled the gun pressed to his head as he was robbed a few years ago inside the hat and boot store he has run for 32 years.         \n\nOver all, crime in Chicago dropped 9 percent in 2012 from the year before in what city officials say was the largest decrease in 30 years. Among crimes that saw dips last year: rape, robbery and car theft. With the city\u2019s longtime gangs splintering into factions and increasing problems with retaliatory violence, homicides rose suddenly in the first three months of the year \u2014 running some 60 percent ahead of the year earlier \u2014 creating a pace that slowed significantly as the year went on.
