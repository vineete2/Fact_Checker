{"headline": "Winning Veterans\u2019 Trust, and Profiting From It", "body": "\nWith every slip and fall, every bruise and ache, the reality set in: Henry Schaffer, 86, could no longer live on his own. So his daughter, Kristi, began searching for a retirement home \u2014 and the money to pay for it.         \n\nAt Aspen View, a senior living complex in Billings, Mont., a lawyer accredited by the Department of Veterans Affairs delivered what seemed like good news: Mr. Schaffer, a World War II veteran, could probably qualify for a generous V.A. benefit. For a few thousand dollars, the man would help veterans like Mr. Schaffer get one.         \n\n\u201cMy dad kept on asking me, \u2018Don\u2019t you think this is too good to be true?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ms. Schaffer recalled. To assure him, she pointed to the lawyer\u2019s V.A. credentials.         \n\nIt was only after Mr. Schaffer had moved in that they learned the truth: He did not qualify at all. Ms. Schaffer says her father now worries that he will be evicted. He can afford only about half of his monthly bill.         \n\nThe benefit, known as the Veterans Pension program, can be worth more than $20,000 a year to war veterans who are disabled or over age 65. But it is open only to those with an annual income of less than $12,465 for a veteran with no dependents \u2014 and Mr. Schaffer collects more than that in Social Security.         \n\nMore money is available for veterans who are unable to cook or bathe on their own, but Mr. Schaffer, while he needs some help, didn\u2019t qualify for that, either.         \n\nAs baby boomers head toward retirement \u2014 worrying not only about their financial futures, but also their parents\u2019 \u2014 a cottage industry has sprung up around the pension program.         \n\nLawyers, financial advisers and insurance brokers have formed a lucrative alliance with retirement communities and assisted living facilities to extract many billions of taxpayer dollars from the V.A., according to interviews with state and federal authorities, as well as a review by The New York Times of hundreds of legal documents and client contracts.         \n\nQuestionable actors are capitalizing on loose oversight to unlock the V.A. money and enrich themselves, sometimes at veterans\u2019 expense. The V.A. accreditation process is so lax that applicants provide their own background information, including any criminal records. But the V.A. has only four full-time employees evaluating the approximately 5,000 applications that it receives annually. Once people get the V.A.\u2019s stamp of approval, they rarely lose it, even if a customer complains or regulatory actions mount. Last year, the V.A. revoked its accreditation for two of its more than 20,000 advisers.         \n\nSome advisers sell financial products like annuities and trusts that are meant to mask veterans\u2019 assets or income \u2014 arrangements can tie up family money for years or even decades. Others circumvent V.A. rules and charge hundreds or even thousands of dollars for advice that may \u2014 or may not \u2014 help veterans qualify. Still others offer to train lawyers and advisers about the workings of the V.A.         \n\n \n         \n\nThe development recalls the array of questionable business practices involving seniors and Medicaid. Indeed, many of the firms that zeroed in on those programs in the past have recast themselves as V.A. specialists. More than 200 firms nationwide now focus on V.A. retirement benefits, according to the Government Accountability Office.         \n\nThe V.A. accreditation allows someone to prepare benefits applications on veterans\u2019 behalf. In theory, federal rules ban these advisers from charging for that service. In practice, elder-care lawyers say, many get around the rules, win veterans\u2019 trust and then pitch costly products and services.         \n\n\u201cThe agency needs to take a closer look at who they are accrediting,\u201d said Daniel Bertoni, the director of disability issues at the Government Accountability Office, which issued a critical report on the V.A. in August. \u201cIt gives the air of a stamp of approval from the agency that has been paying their checks for many years.\u201d         \n\nRandal Noller, a V.A. spokesman, said the agency planned to review advisers\u2019 training materials and perform more robust background checks \u201cas necessary.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWe realize there are some areas in the program that we could improve to ensure that individuals who obtain and maintain V.A. accreditation are qualified,\u201d Mr. Noller said.
