{"headline": "Cahill\u2019s Late Theatrics", "body": "\nHARRISON, N.J. \u2014 The Red Bulls snatched a point and a playoff berth Saturday night in a 2-2 tie against the New England Revolution at Red Bull Arena, but like so much else for this club, it did not come easily.         \n\n\u201cWe should have never put ourselves in that position, but you get times in games and situations where you get tested; today we got tested big time,\u201d midfielder Tim Cahill said.         \n\nThe position the Red Bulls found themselves in was a goal down with the clock tick, tick, ticking more than six minutes into second-half stoppage time. They had squandered an early goal by Fabian Espindola and a dominant first half that should have provided a multigoal lead but did not. Instead, the Red Bulls first found themselves deadlocked late in the second half after a questionable hand ball in the penalty area on Jamison Olave that Lee Nguyen converted from the penalty spot. And then, minutes after the Revolution\u2019s Andy Dorman had been shown a red card for a studs-up challenge, the Red Bulls trailed after a goal from the impressive youngster Diego Fagundez in stoppage time.         \n\nBut Cahill, as he has done so many times this season, his first full year in Major League Soccer, showed again why he has emerged as the midfield engine and inexhaustible heart of the Red Bulls (15-9-8, 53 points).         \n\n\u201cHe embodies everything this team wants to be, from the character to just the hard work and he has had an incredible season,\u201d goalkeeper Luis Robles said. \u201cWithout Tim we wouldn\u2019t be in the position that we are in. That\u2019s why he\u2019s an elite player, that\u2019s why he has accomplished all that he has and we\u2019re very, very, very grateful that he\u2019s in our team.\u201d         \n\nWith a sellout crowd of 25,219 on its feet and the final whistle seconds away, Cahill perched himself at the top of the New England penalty area as the Red Bulls prepared for a last-gasp free kick, which was spotted midway between the left touchline and the penalty area. Robles also raced forward, giving the Red Bulls an 11-on-9 advantage with Dorman sent off and the rookie defender Andrew Farrell off the field receiving treatment for an eye injury. Jonny Steele\u2019s kick was punched out by goalkeeper Matt Reis and the ball found Cahill at the penalty spot. His looped header spun into the net and the Red Bulls had the tie, a point and a spot in the Eastern Conference playoffs. It was Cahill\u2019s team-leading 10th goal of the season.         \n\n\u201cWhen the ball fell I tried to just push it nicely, not hit it too high or not get enough on it,\u201d Cahill said. \u201cI just wanted it to sit in the net; because with the keeper coming out, all I needed to do was fish it and then after that I just wanted to let the ball float in and be safe. No one touched it and it hit the back of the net. Everyone was buzzing after that.\u201d         \n\nThe draw enabled the Red Bulls to hold on to first place in the conference. The club is off next weekend and has two regular-season matches left (at Houston on Oct. 20 and against Chicago on Oct. 27). There are also two FIFA international dates over the next 10 days, and Cahill and defender David Carney will leave to join Australia\u2019s national team for friendly matches at France and at England.         \n\n\u201cMy team for sure needs a rest, for sure, like I said, mentally and physically,\u201d the Red Bulls rookie coach, Mike Petke, said. \u201cI\u2019m welcoming a rest.\u201d Petke said rather than give the team a full week off and bring them back for a week of training, they would have three days off, three days on, three days off, and then five days leading into the game. He said this would keep the players sharp and in shape.         \n\nThe point makes the Red Bulls the first club to clinch a postseason berth this season. The team is unbeaten in six games and has a 7-2-5 record in its last 14 games dating to July 13. The next goal is winning the league\u2019s Supporters Shield, which goes to the No. 1 team over all during the regular season. And it is likely the Red Bulls will have to win both of their remaining games.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great moment right now for the organization,\u201d Petke said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good moment for me, to take a deep breath finally, but this was our initial goal. Our initial goal was to make the playoffs, and now our goals get recalculated.\u201d         \n\nThe captain Thierry Henry summed up clinching a postseason berth: \u201cThat was the aim at the beginning and obviously now we know we can go further than that. Hopefully we\u2019re going to perform well against Houston and Chicago in the last games, but I think we have to enjoy making the playoffs. It was kind of a long season \u2014 still not over, don\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 but talking about the playoffs, we made it. The hard way tonight.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/07/sports/soccer/cahills-late-theatrics-for-red-bulls.html", "date": "2013-10-06", "description": "The Red Bulls held on to first place Saturday night and clinched a playoff berth in M.L.S."}
