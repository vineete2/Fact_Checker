{"headline": "Nets\u2019 Lopez Breaks Bone in Foot and Could Miss Rest of Season", "body": "\nHealth has been everything for the Nets this season: the ominous variable that threatened to derail their season even before it began, the fickle state they lacked during their disastrous start, the factor they enthusiastically linked to their brief moments of success. As a vague and mutable concept, it still offered hope that the Nets could turn around their season. Now that seems far less likely.         \n\nThe Nets announced Saturday morning that Brook Lopez, their All-Star center and primary scoring option, had fractured the fifth metatarsal in his right foot, an injury that seemed likely to keep him sidelined for most, if not all, of the remainder of the season.         \n\nThe diagnosis delivered a devastating blow to the reeling, injury-stricken Nets, who spent the summer pumping up their ambitions to win the N.B.A. championship this season. Instead, they have stumbled to a 9-17 record while dealing with significant injuries to several players.         \n\nBut Lopez\u2019s injury overshadows them all. It will unsettle the Nets\u2019 deeply talented but still dysfunctional roster, forcing the team to scramble to fill a huge void. It will also magnify the already big health-related question mark that has wrapped itself around Lopez, even as he was earning plaudits as one of the league\u2019s premier offensive centers.         \n\nThe Nets did not immediately specify a timetable on his return, noting that they would have more information after further consultation with team physicians in the coming week. But a long layoff seems likely, given that it is the third time Lopez has fractured the foot.         \n\nLopez broke the same foot twice \u2014 and required two operations \u2014 during the lockout-shortened 2011-12 season, in which he appeared in just five games. This past summer, he had a third operation, to repair a bent screw that had been implanted in the foot after the initial fracture.         \n\nLopez, 25, was drafted 10th over all in 2008 after playing two years at Stanford. The Nets committed to him two summers ago, signing him to a four-year, $61 million contract. Lopez came back strong last season and was named to his first All-Star team.         \n\nBut concerns about whether he was another talented big man whose career could be undercut by foot injuries were already widespread. Chronic foot issues curtailed the careers of outstanding players like Bill Walton and Yao Ming.         \n\nAfter the front office assembled a roster filled with star players this past summer, Lopez remained the Nets\u2019 focal point on offense, a player whose presence needed to be established each night to open up the rest of the offense.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never played with a center whose skill level is at this point,\u201d Kevin Garnett said during the team\u2019s October training camp. \u201cI\u2019ve obviously played with greats, but to the point where he\u2019s young and still hasn\u2019t peaked yet.\u201d         \n\nLopez delivered when he was healthy. He played in 17 games this year, averaging 20.7 points, 6.0 rebounds and 1.8 blocks a game.         \n\nBut his health this season had already been a problem. He sprained his left ankle during a Nov. 15 game in Phoenix and missed seven games. He returned for a short spell and played well, but then sprained the ankle again and missed another two contests.         \n\nThe foot injury occurred Friday night during the Nets\u2019 121-120 overtime loss to the 76ers at Wells Fargo Center. The Nets did not say on which play Lopez injured his foot, but he did fall with 4 minutes 53 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter after colliding under the basket with Thaddeus Young of Philadelphia. Lopez seemed to land awkwardly on his right foot on his way down.         \n\nLopez played the remainder of the game, logging more than 44 minutes in all, and finished with 22 points. He did not make himself available to reporters after the game.         \n\nSize was considered a strong point of the Nets\u2019 roster, and players like Garnett, Andray Blatche and Mirza Teletovic will be called upon to make up for Lopez\u2019s inside presence. Reserve big men like the rookie Mason Plumlee and the veteran Reggie Evens could also have expanded roles. But making up for Lopez\u2019s production will be a difficult task.         \n\nThe Nets have battled numerous injuries. Deron Williams, the team\u2019s starting point guard, returned recently after missing considerable time with a series of ankle injuries. Paul Pierce, a veteran forward, strained his groin during the opening month and has been playing with a broken bone in his shooting hand.         \n\nThe team is also without forward Andrei Kirilenko, who has played just four games because of a sore back, and guard Jason Terry, who has played just 11 games while battling soreness in his surgically repaired left knee.         \n\nCapricious health has been a problem for the Nets this season, but there was a lingering sense that thing would stabilize, that the team could blossom before too long to chase a trophy.         \n\nThat feeling dissipated considerably Saturday.
