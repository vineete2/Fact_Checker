{"headline": "Jets\u2019 Smith, No Stranger to Setbacks, Knows the Value of Endurance", "body": "\nFLORHAM PARK, N.J. \u2014 Geno Smith was asked at his locker to share the most challenging experience of his rookie season with  \n.         \n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s just been one,\u201d Smith said.         \n\nThe four-turnover game in Tennessee begot the 40-point loss in Cincinnati, which begot the four-turnover debacle in Buffalo, which begot the misery last weekend in Baltimore. Every week, his buffet of options expands, and indeed it has once more.         \n\nFor all his struggles, Smith\u2019s most difficult moment has not happened yet. It will on Sunday, when the Jets, mired in a two-game losing streak and on the outskirts of the A.F.C. playoff race, play Miami at MetLife Stadium.         \n\nA victory resuscitates their chances. A loss could ruin them. A victory could instill faith in Smith. A loss could destroy it.         \n\n\u201cMany of these losses were my fault,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIf I had made a few plays here and there, we wouldn\u2019t be in this position.\u201d         \n\nSmith\u2019s teammates have praised his demeanor and his accountability, his practice habits and his willingness to learn. They want to believe that he will respond Sunday, and in the Jets\u2019 four games after that, but they do not know for certain.         \n\nAt every juncture in his football life, Smith has confronted other critical stages of his development, though not of this magnitude. He endured them. He dealt with them. He overcame them. And he says he will again.         \n\n \n\nOne yard separated Miramar (Fla.) High School from victory, and Geno Smith wanted the ball.The unbeaten  \n trailed their district rival Cypress Bay, 41-40, with 6.4 seconds left, and Smith, who had just thrown an 18-yard touchdown, remained on the field. They were going for two.         \n\nHis offensive coordinator, Chris Perkins, called a fake bootleg, giving Smith the option to run or pass. Smith took the snap and sprinted left. With his receivers covered, he bolted for the pylon. A Cypress Bay linebacker met Smith at the goal line and shoved him out of bounds. Smith broke the plane, or so he thought. The officials did not agree. He was ruled down. At the 1-inch line. Cypress Bay had won.         \n\nSmith ran to the Miramar sideline and told Perkins and Coach Damon Cogdell that he had scored, saying, \u201cThey\u2019re taking this away from us, they\u2019re taking this away from us.\u201d He was disconsolate \u2014 to the point of \u201cinjustice,\u201d Perkins said.         \n\n\u201cNow that I think about it, even going back to it, I can almost feel that pain,\u201d Smith said.         \n\nWhile discussing this game at his locker last week, Smith was calm and composed. But on the night Miramar lost by an inch, Oct. 11, 2008, Smith granted postgame interviews in tears. Upon returning to the locker room, Smith told Perkins: \u201cCoach, they got that one, but they won\u2019t get the next one. We\u2019re going to make sure of that.\u201d         \n\nIn Smith\u2019s first few years at Miramar, if Perkins sensed he was not putting forth a complete effort, he would rouse him for 5:30 a.m. training sessions. Smith would crab-walk around the field, run up and down the stadium\u2019s stairs and throw footballs \u2014 wet and dry \u2014 up and down the field, covering the full length at least 12 times.         \n\nBy his senior season, Smith no longer needed those morning practices. He approached the rest of the season with a singular focus, Cogdell said. He watched extra film and demanded the same of his teammates. When friends on Cypress Bay\u2019s team taunted him, Smith told them to wait, just wait. The rematch he craved came on Nov. 28, in a Florida Class 6A regional semifinal.         \n\nAgain, Miramar trailed by a point late in the fourth quarter, and Smith had driven the Patriots to the Cypress Bay 22 with 10 seconds left. Perkins still remembers the play. Smith pumped once and connected with Dante Chambers in the back corner of the end zone. Three seconds remained. Final score: Miramar 34, Cypress Bay 29.         \n\nMiramar\u2019s season ended two weeks later, with a loss in the state semifinals, but Cogdell said Smith learned an important lesson.         \n\n\u201cWhen you play well and win, it\u2019s a great feeling,\u201d Cogdell said. \u201cBut when you play well and lose, it\u2019s a different beast.\u201d         \n\n", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/01/sports/football/jets-smith-no-stranger-to-setbacks-knows-the-value-of-endurance.html", "date": "2013-11-30", "description": "Geno Smith\u2019s most difficult moment yet will come on Sunday, when the Jets, mired in a two-game losing streak and on the outskirts of the A.F.C. playoff race, play Miami."}
