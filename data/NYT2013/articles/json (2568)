He was in charge of dairy and frozen foods for the A.&P. supermarket chain, making $125,000 a year.         \n\nHe was also a guest that month at a White House forum on joblessness, in recognition of his work creating  \n, a volunteer networking organization with 28 chapters in New Jersey serving 1,200 unemployed, mainly white-collar, baby boomers. \u201cJohn has one of the best volunteer organizations out there,\u201d said Ben Seigel, a deputy director at the Labor Department. \u201cHe\u2019s tireless and always upbeat.\u201d         \n\nLately Mr. Fugazzie has been feeling a little weary and beat down. One morning last October, just before his 57th birthday, he was laid off and, carrying a box of belongings from his office, driven home in a car service hired by the company. In the 10 months since, he has applied for more than 400 positions and had 10 interviews, but still has no job.         \n\nHe and his family are living in his 88-year-old mother\u2019s home, and last month he awoke at 4:30 a.m., sweating profusely, in the midst of a heart attack.         \n\nAs happens to many Americans, when he lost his job, he lost his health insurance. He now owes $171,569.44 for the six nights he spent at the hospital.         \n\nAnd so on the evening of Aug. 15, at a meeting of the job club he himself started here two years ago, he told the others he was just like them. \u201cI need a job,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to make money now.\u201d         \n\nMost of the 15 men and women meeting at the library in this prosperous suburb were middle-aged or older, people who had worked all their lives, but lost jobs in the recession and its aftermath and have not been able to get back to where they were. Many of them worry that they never will, in part because of discrimination by employers against older workers.         \n\nOn the statistical surface, boomers seem better off than other age groups. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate for workers 55 to 64 (the category that best matches boomers, who range from 48 to 67) was 5.4 percent in July, compared with 7.4 percent for the general population.         \n\nBut almost every other number from the bureau makes it clear that while the economy may be improving, a substantial number of older workers who lost jobs \u2014 even those lucky enough to be re-employed \u2014 are still suffering. Two-thirds in that age group who found work again are making less than they did in their previous job; their median salary loss is 18 percent compared with a 6.7 percent drop for 20- to 24-year-olds.         \n\nThe re-employment rate for 55- to 64-year-olds is 47 percent and 24 percent for those over 65, compared with 62 percent for 20- to 54-year-olds. And finding another job takes far longer: 46 weeks for boomers, compared with 20 weeks for 16- to 24-year-olds.         \n\nNor are those who believe age discrimination was a factor likely to have much luck in court. In 2009, just as the economy was hitting rock-bottom, the Supreme Court issued a ruling that toughened the standard for proving bias.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier for younger workers to bounce back,\u201d says Mr. Seigel of the Labor Department. \u201cThey don\u2019t have many financial obligations. Older workers are supporting families; they may be supporting parents. They can\u2019t afford to spend two years going back for a degree to retrain.\u201d         \n\nAt the Aug. 15 meeting, Barbara Braun, who worked as a marketing director for a pharmaceutical company, said she wasn\u2019t able to relocate to California when the company moved. \u201cI have a mother with Alzheimer\u2019s, I think it would have killed her,\u201d she said. \u201cOur lives are full of complications we didn\u2019t have at 35.\u201d         \n\nThey have no doubt that their age is held against them, yet work to keep hopeful. When a woman suggested shaving a decade off her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and not posting a photo on networking and job search sites to hide her age, Mr. Fugazzie advised against it. \u201cWhen you go to the interview, you\u2019re going to look like who you are,\u201d he said. \u201cTo waste time hiding it when you\u2019re only going to lose at the other end makes no sense. If they don\u2019t want someone your age, you don\u2019t want them.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/27/booming/for-laid-off-older-workers-age-bias-is-pervasive.html", "date": "2013-08-26", "description": "A lower unemployment rate for older workers masks troubling trends of reduced pay and longer job searches."}
