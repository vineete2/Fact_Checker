{"headline": "Peaceful Protest Over Istanbul Park Turns Violent as Police Crack Down", "body": "\nISTANBUL \u2014 Police officers attacked a group of peaceful demonstrators on Friday in Istanbul\u2019s Taksim Square with water cannons and tear gas, sending scores of people, protesters and tourists alike, scurrying into shops and luxury hotels and turning the center of this city into a battle zone at the height of tourist season.         \n\nThe police action was the latest violent crackdown by the government against a growing protest movement challenging plans to replace a park in Taksim Square, Istanbul\u2019s equivalent of Cairo\u2019s Tahrir Square, with a replica Ottoman-era army barracks that would house a shopping mall.         \n\nBut while the removal of the park, which is filled with sycamore trees and is the last significant green space in the center of Istanbul, set off the protests at the beginning of the week, the gatherings have broadened into a wider expression of anger against the heavy-handed tactics and urban development plans of the government and its leader, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. His party, now in power a decade, is increasingly viewed by many Turks as becoming authoritarian.         \n\nMr. Erdogan still has great support among Turkey\u2019s religious masses, but secular critics cite his government\u2019s  \n and intimidation of journalists as evidence of its  \n.         \n\nMuch of the anger also centers on the struggle over Istanbul\u2019s public spaces. Mr. Erdogan\u2019s government has proceeded with disputed urban development plans with little public input, while his police forces have increasingly used tear gas against peaceful protesters, resulting in scores of injuries, including the hospitalization on Friday of a Turkish lawmaker, a member of the Kurdish Party who had become a vocal participant in the protests, after he was hit by a tear gas canister.         \n\nThe protest movement comes amid continued public anger at Turkey\u2019s policy of supporting the rebels in Syria, which many Turks feel has led to a violent spillover inside Turkey, including  \n in the southern city of Reyhanli, which killed dozens of people. The rising public disenchantment represents a significant political challenge to Mr. Erdogan, who is planning to run for the presidency next year and has been trying to alter the Constitution to create a more powerful presidential system.         \n\nIn the early afternoon Friday, as protesters gathered and began shouting antigovernment chants, police officers in riot gear began surrounding the group, positioning vehicles that resembled tanks at the edge of the square around the protesters, who were mostly sitting.         \n\n\u201cTaksim is ours; we are not giving it to the A.K.P.!\u201d they chanted, referring to Mr. Erdogan\u2019s Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party, known as the A.K.P.         \n\nAs they chanted, police officers casually put on their gas masks and the operators of the tanklike vehicles aimed their big guns, which fire a mixture of water and tear gas, at the group. Then chaos erupted. Protesters and onlookers, some of them tourists, ran down side streets where shopkeepers offered sliced lemons to soothe the burning sensation of the gas, and pharmacists doled out ointments for skin burns.         \n\n\u201cThe pigs, the pigs,\u201d said Esra Yurtnac, who was crying as she sought refuge in a bakery after being gassed. \u201cAll they know is how to use gas.\u201d         \n\nShe added, \u201cThey think they can silence us with force, but they won\u2019t.\u201d         \n\nHours after the clashes with protesters, an Istanbul court on Friday ruled in favor of a petition by a local advocacy group and halted the project until parties submitted their legal arguments to court, the semiofficial Anatolian News Agency reported. The interior minister also pledged on Friday that claims of excessive force would be investigated.         \n\nThe chaos followed a dawn raid on an Occupy Wall Street-style encampment in Gezi Park, near Taksim, in which the police also used tear gas to drive away protesters and later barricaded the park. In an earlier raid on the camp, on Thursday, the police set fire to some tents. The brief occupation of the park, which began after bulldozers had started to take down trees, had taken on a festival-like atmosphere, with yoga, barbecues and musical performances, while those gathered chanted, \u201cTaksim is ours! Istanbul is ours!\u201d         \n\nThe people adorned the camp with banners expressing the rising anger at the reshaping of Istanbul\u2019s urban spaces by the government.
