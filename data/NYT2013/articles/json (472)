{"headline": "No Nachos for You, General Zod, We\u2019re on Weight Watchers", "body": "\n \n         \n\nI\u2019m sorry you haven\u2019t heard much from me lately, but I\u2019ve been going to Weight Watchers and most of my time has been taken up measuring food. I know there are people who can do this by eye, using such Weight Watchers tips as one cup is equivalent to your fist. The problem is so few foods come in fist-shaped packages. Like popcorn. I spent so much time at \"Man of Steel\" trying to figure out how many fists were in my box, I missed key plot points, like why Superman\u2019s parents put him naked in the spacecraft without even a little onesie that said, \"My Parents Got Me This Shirt in Krypton But Now They\u2019re All Dead, Including the Planet.\u201d         \n\nI was also distracted by such Weight Watchers concerns as what the evil General Zod and Faora-Ul subsisted on when they were freed from that prison in space and went on an extended road trip through the universe.         \n\nDid they follow Weight Watchers\u2019 suggestion for vacation auto travel, packing their own healthy snacks like string cheese and soy chips? Does Evil Doing count as a food-burning activity and if so, how many points can you earn leaping to an airborne fighter jet, jumping through the window and flinging the pilot to his death? I think it should be good for at least 8 points, which equals one margarita, which, being nearly a third of my 26-point daily food allotment and not wishing to dig into my extra points bank, I haven\u2019t had for seven weeks.         \n\nI hope this doesn\u2019t sound as if I am down on Weight Watchers, by the way, because I always lose weight on it. Also for me the next best thing to eating is talking about eating, which we do at meetings a lot. Men talking about the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue are nothing compared with a room of Weight Watchers talking about peanut butter, which frequently gets me so heated up I have to go home and get some. I try to keep it to a tablespoon. (Thumb tip to first joint, 2 points.)         \n\nI also enjoy hearing members talk about weekly challenges, which often run along these lines: I went on a visit to my sister\u2019s house and though she knew I was on plan and I had brought my own crate of water-packed tuna, she insisted on making fried chicken and creamed corn and lemon meringue pie, holding a gun on me till I finished every bite. I was so upset that on the way home I bought one of those big plastic packs of miniature Milky Ways meaning to eat just one and throw out the rest, but I was just so annoyed I ended up eating every one. I knew what I was doing, but I just could not stop.         \n\nAnd we all sigh sympathetically and I go home thinking, \u201cWell, I may not be perfect when it comes to eating sugar rich foods that are high in empty calories, but at least I do not have a sister.\u201d         \n\nAnother great thing about Weight Watchers these days are their apps, which track not only your food, but also your activities. Activities are important because they allow you to rack up more points for food, the thing I always miss when dieting.         \n\nThe Weight Watchers app includes just about any activity you can think of: Ax chopping (1 point for 10 minutes), bobsledding (2 points for 10 minutes), cleaning the barn (not much opportunity for that in Manhattan, but in case you are in Iowa it\u2019s 2 points for 10 minutes), scrubbing the floor on hands and knees (1 point for 10 minutes, which I consider much too low. I would give it 8 points, for that margarita). I am especially intrigued by the points you can earn running while pushing a wheelchair. (2 points for 10 minutes.) The only reason I can think you would run while pushing a wheelchair is if somebody pushing a mugger in a wheelchair was chasing you. On the plus side if the mugger was on plan and took your iPhone, you could say: \"Listen, pal, before you run off with that could you add \u2018running while pushing wheelchair, 20 minutes,\u2019 to my daily tracker? That will come to 4 points which will help work off the 8-point double vodka I will be having as soon as you stop flashing that knife in my face.\u201d         \n\nThe only thing I could not find in the activity listing was sex. I cornered my group leader privately at the end of a meeting and asked him how one could calculate that.         \n\n\u201cIn a way you can,\u201d he said.         \n\nHe flipped to the end of a booklet and showed me a chart which determined the intensity of an activity by your regularity of breathing, whether you were sweating, and whether you could talk. The chart also listed ability to sing. If you can, your activity level is low (and you should probably have the \u201ctime to see other people\u201d discussion, though not until you are finished). If you cannot sing during an activity you can rate the activity as moderate or high.         \n\nI found this somewhat helpful though not as much as I would have liked and so, as a public service for readers who are also Weight Watchers, I am going to provide my own little chart.         \n\nSex during the first six weeks of relationship: High Intensity, 2 points for every 10 minutes.         \n\nSex when something is really worrying you: Low Intensity, because as soon as you are finished you will get up and have something to eat: 1 point for every 10 minutes.         \n\nSex when you are visiting friends in their thin-walled Fire Island beach house: No points, because you won\u2019t have any.         \n\nAnd if my sex-activity-points chart is too complicated, don\u2019t worry about it. As my group leader told me, \u201cIf you didn\u2019t earn points, would you stop doing it?\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/booming/no-nachos-for-you-general-zod-were-on-weight-watchers.html", "date": "2013-06-26", "description": "Is Evil Doing a food-burning activity?
