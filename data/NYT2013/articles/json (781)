{"headline": "Only Echoes Stir the Quiet at the Hall of Fame", "body": "\nCOOPERSTOWN, N.Y. \u2014 The  \n celebrates the sport\u2019s history at this time each year by inducting at least one new member with small-town pomp and fealty to decades of tradition.         \n\nUsually, he is alive, filled with joy and stories of his first days as a ballplayer.         \n\nBut on Sunday, for the first time since 1965, there was no breathing inductee to deliver a speech, tell a joke or remember advice from his first manager.         \n\nInstead, in a rain-delayed and sparsely attended ceremony that underscored the lingering damage that performance-enhancing drugs have inflicted on America\u2019s national pastime, the three men who were enshrined have been dead since the 1930s. Two were better known to historians and aficionados than fans. Several living players have Hall-worthy statistics and might have lured a huge crowd to this village, which was founded by James Fenimore Cooper\u2019s father and boosted by the myth of baseball\u2019s invention here.         \n\nBut Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens and Sammy Sosa, who were all in their first year of eligibility for election but tainted by their involvement in or connection to baseball\u2019s steroids era, were firmly rejected by the Baseball Writers\u2019 Association of America earlier this year. Last week, Ryan Braun, the Milwaukee Brewers star, was suspended for 65 games by Major League Baseball for his involvement with an anti-aging clinic in Florida that baseball officials believe distributed performance-enhancing drugs. Alex Rodriguez, the Yankees star who has not played this season, is a focus of the investigation and could be suspended soon.         \n\n\u201cI think baseball is hurt and the Hall suffers,\u201d said Johnny Bench, the Cincinnati Reds catcher who was inducted in 1989 before thousands of fans who had ridden buses to see him. Referring to players linked to performance-enhancing drugs, Bench said, \u201cDo they qualify by putting numbers that are tainted?\u201d         \n\nOzzie Smith, the Cardinals and Padres shortstop who entered the Hall in 2002, said that being rejected by voters \u201cis one of the things you have to weigh when you decide to do something wrong.\u201d         \n\n\u201cYou have to realize you won\u2019t get in,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe Hall estimated the attendance at 2,500 at the Clark Sports Center \u2014 that seemed kind, and it was well below the usual 10,000 to 15,000 \u2014 to see the inductions of Jacob Ruppert, the Yankees\u2019 owner from 1915 until his death in 1939; the umpire Hank O\u2019Day, who officiated at the first World Series in 1903; and Deacon White, a 19th-century catcher and infielder.         \n\nThere were no broad swaths of colorful team jerseys worn by fans to cheer for Ruppert, O\u2019Day and White as their distant relatives stood below a canopy to speak for them. Rows of white seats were unfilled. Fans played catch on the grassland that was so packed six years ago \u2014 when at least 75,000 attended the inductions of Cal Ripken and Tony Gwynn \u2014 that fans watched from distant hillsides as if they were faraway bleachers.         \n\nEven onstage, there were 32 Hall of Famers where there are usually 40 to 50. No Willie Mays. No Reggie Jackson. No Tom Seaver. No Yogi Berra.         \n\nStill, Jim and Carol Needham of Mira Loma, Calif., were in the sparse crowd. They knew little about the inductees but love baseball and love the pomp of the induction \u2014 even without the likes of Bonds, Clemens or Sosa. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that some players have to resort to that to make their games better \u2014 they were great already,\u201d Carol Needham said.         \n\nKeith Pittman of Terre Haute, Ind., came for his 12th induction, with friends who have attended the ritual for 17 and 32 consecutive years.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about honoring our heroes,\u201d he said, looking around at the near-empty grounds that he preferred to see as jammed as they were in 2007. He said that he was \u201churt and disappointed\u201d but had put his emotions aside because \u201ceveryone is to blame\u201d for the steroids era, \u201cincluding fans; it was too enjoyable to let go.\u201d         \n\nOne of his friends, Jim Mishk, a power plant mechanic from Fishkill, N.Y., said: \u201cI like to see the players on stage. Nobody got elected. But so what?\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/29/sports/baseball/with-no-living-inductees-only-echoes-stir-the-quiet-at-the-hall-of-fame.html", "date": "2013-07-28", "description": "The annual ceremony was especially notable for the players who were excluded and underscored the damage that performance-enhancing drugs have inflicted on baseball."}
