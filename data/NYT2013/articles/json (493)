{"headline": "Going, Going, Still Going? Voyager 1 at Solar System\u2019s Edge", "body": "\nAt the edge of the solar system, there are no signs that proclaim, \u201cYou are now entering interstellar space.\u201d         \n\nNASA\u2019s Voyager 1 spacecraft, launched more than 35 years ago and now  \n is closing in on this boundary. In recent years scientists have been waiting eagerly for it to become the first artificial object to leave the solar system and enter the wider reaches of the Milky Way, which they fully expect it to do. But there has been at least one false alarm.         \n\nOn Thursday, scientists reported that, no, Voyager 1 still had not reached interstellar space, but it had entered a region that no one expected and no one can yet explain, a curious zone that is almost certainly the last layer of our Sun\u2019s empire \u2014 technically speaking, the heliosphere. Three papers published in the journal Science describe in detail the sudden and unpredicted changes encountered in the surroundings of Voyager 1, which left Earth about three months after the original \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie was released and is heading for the cosmos at 38,000 miles per hour.         \n\nScientists had expected that Voyager 1 would detect two telltale signs as it passed through the heliosheath, the outermost neighborhood of the solar system, which is thought to abut the heliopause, as the actual boundary is known. Happily, the key instruments on Voyager 1, as well as those on its twin, Voyager 2, are still working after all these years, and its nuclear power source will last until at least 2020.         \n\nLast summer, one of the two events occurred, but not the other, leaving scientists perplexed. Scientists had predicted that at the boundary between solar system and interstellar space, the solar wind \u2014 a stream of charged particles blown out by the Sun \u2014 would fade away, and that Voyager 1 would no longer detect it. That happened.         \n\nThey also expected that the direction of the magnetic field would change as Voyager 1 emerged from the Sun\u2019s magnetic bubble. That did not.         \nAs the Voyager spacecraft near the solar system\u2019s outer limits, they are helping scientists learn about how cosmic rays make their way in. \n\n\u201cNature is far more imaginative than we are,\u201d said Stamatios M. Krimigis, a scientist at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory who is the principal investigator of an instrument that records charged particles hitting Voyager 1. Dr. Krimigis is an author of  \n.         \n\nLast July, the spacecraft \u2014 which is roughly 1,600 pounds and would fit inside a cube about 13 feet on each side,  \n \u2014 observed a momentary dip in the intensity of the solar wind. \u201cIt was exciting,\u201d said Edward C. Stone, the project scientist for the two Voyagers. \u201cWe had never seen such a drop before. It happened in less than a day. Then five days later, it was back up.\u201d         \n\nIn mid-August, there was a deeper momentary dip.         \n\nThen, on Aug. 25, the solar wind dropped by a factor of more than a thousand, vanishing to imperceptible levels, and it has remained at essentially zero since. At the same time, the number of cosmic rays from outside the solar system  \n.         \n\n\u201cIt looked like we were outside,\u201d Dr. Stone said.         \n\nBut the magnetic field has steadily, stubbornly pointed in the same direction, indicating that Voyager 1 is still ensconced within the Sun\u2019s magnetic field. Scientists guess that in this region the magnetic fields of the solar system partly connect to those of the surrounding interstellar space, allowing the solar particles to escape. (Charged particles travel along magnetic field lines.) They have named the zone through which Voyager 1 is hurtling the  \n.         \n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s clear we do not have a model which explains all of this,\u201d Dr. Stone said.         \n\nVoyager 2, which is moving slightly more slowly and is not as far from the Sun, has not yet encountered this region.         \n\nDr. Stone noted that when the two Voyagers launched in 1977 on a grand tour of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, the space age was just 20 years old, and there was no way to know that NASA had built something that would last 35 years, long after it passed the planets. But the designers of the mission were prescient to be prepared if they lasted that long.         \n\n\u201cIt turns out that in fact we designed the cosmic ray instrument specifically for this phase of this mission,\u201d Dr. Stone said. \u201cWe were planning, and it really paid off. We\u2019ve begun to see what\u2019s outside even though the magnetic field says you\u2019re not outside.\u201d         \n\nAs for actually reaching the outside of the solar system, Dr. Stone said, \u201cit could be a few months, or it could be several more years.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/28/science/space/going-going-still-going-voyager-1-at-solar-systems-edge.html", "date": "2013-06-27", "description": "Scientists waiting for the spacecraft to enter the wider reaches of the Milky Way are perplexed: Only one of two telltale signs of its departure has been detected."}
