{"headline": "G.O.P. Maps Out Waves of Attacks Over Health Law", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The memo distributed to House Republicans this week was concise and blunt, listing talking points and marching orders: \u201cBecause of Obamacare, I Lost My Insurance.\u201d \u201cObamacare Increases Health Care Costs.\u201d \u201cThe Exchanges May Not Be Secure, Putting Personal Information at Risk.\u201d \u201cContinue Collecting Constituent Stories.\u201d         \n\nThe  \n, the product of a series of closed-door strategy sessions that began in mid-October, is part of an increasingly organized Republican attack on the Affordable Care Act, President Obama\u2019s signature legislative initiative. Republican strategists say that over the next several months, they intend to keep Democrats on their heels through a multilayered, sequenced assault.         \n\nThe idea is to gather stories of people affected by the health care law \u2014 through social media, letters from constituents, or meetings during visits back home \u2014 and use them to open a line of attack, keep it going until it enters the public discourse and forces a response, then quickly pivot to the next topic.         \n\nFor a House more used to disarray than methodical game plans, the success so far has been something of a surprise, even to the campaign\u2019s organizers.         \n\n\u201cYeah, there is a method being followed here,\u201d said Representative Michael C. Burgess, a Texas Republican involved in the effort, \u201cbut, really, these stories are creating themselves.\u201d         \n\nFirst it was the malfunctioning website,  \n, then millions of insurance policy cancellation notices sent to individuals with plans that did not meet the requirements of the health law. Earlier this week, the House aired allegations that personal data is insecure on the Internet-based insurance exchanges.         \n\nAt a congressional field hearing set for Friday in Gastonia, N.C., the line of attack will shift to rate shocks expected to jolt the insurance markets in the next two years. Coming soon: a push to highlight people losing access to their longtime physicians and changes in Medicare Advantage programs for older people.         \n\nThe effort has its roots in a strategy developed last spring, when House Republican leaders \u2014 plagued by party divisions that were thwarting legislative accomplishments \u2014 refocused the House\u2019s committees on oversight rather than on the development of new policies.         \n\nRob Borden, a general counsel to Representative Darrell Issa of California, the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, moved to a newly created position that reported jointly to Speaker John A. Boehner and Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader. Mr. Borden\u2019s task was to coordinate and monitor oversight activities across separate committees to make sure they are not overlapping or undercutting one another.         \n\nThat aggressive campaign, which produced numerous hearings on the attacks in Benghazi, Libya, as well as on I.R.S. scrutiny of conservative groups, is now increasingly consumed by the health care fight. House Republican leaders empowered four committees \u2014 oversight, Ways and Means, Energy and Commerce, and Education and the Workforce \u2014 to take the lead, with support from other panels, such as the Science and Homeland Security Committees, which have examined computer security.         \n\nMr. Cantor and Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, another member of the Republican leadership, have also leaned on all 231 House Republicans. A 17-page \u201cHouse Republican Playbook\u201d walks members through \u201cmessaging tools\u201d like talking points, social media tactics and \u201cdigital fliers\u201d; details lines of attack; offers up a sample opinion article for local newspapers; and provides an extensive timeline on the health care law and an exhaustive list of legislative responses that have gone nowhere.         \n\nA message of the week is presented to the Republican members at the beginning of each week, Ms. McMorris Rodgers said. A \u201cCall to Action\u201d email chain distributes relevant breaking news. A new website,  \n, is collecting anecdotes from each member.         \n\nThe goal, according to Ms. McMorris Rodgers, is to use all the \u201cRepublican voices we have in the House, the media markets in all the districts we represent, to take our message all over the country.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIt penetrates,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s powerful.\u201d         \n\nTo Democrats, especially in the White House, the power of the effort stems from using anecdotes to paint a fundamentally misleading picture.
