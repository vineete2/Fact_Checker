{"headline": "In Syria, Doctors Risk Life and Juggle Ethics", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Months before a chemical weapons attack killed hundreds of Syrians and prompted threats of an American military strike, an anesthesiologist named Majid heard an explosion near his home in a Damascus suburb. He rushed to the makeshift hospital where he works and found patients with  \n skin,  \n and  \n.         \n\nMajid, who gave only his first name to protect his safety, collected hair and urine samples, clothing, tree leaves, soil and even a dead bird. He shared it with the  \n, a humanitarian group that had been delivering such samples to American intelligence officials, as proof of possible chemical attacks.         \n\n\u201cWe kept communicating with the State Department about what is next \u2014 they told us that these are limited attacks,\u201d said the society\u2019s president, Dr. Zaher Sahloul, adding that he had spoken with Robert S. Ford, the American ambassador to Syria, and Samantha Power, then a White House aide and now the United Nations envoy. \u201cIt was very important for us to get this information out, but it took time to gain traction, and for the world to react.\u201d         \n\nNow the world has reacted. United Nations inspectors have taken the first steps to  \n. But while the Obama administration claims credit for pushing President Bashar al-Assad into giving up the arsenal, some experts say the real credit lies with the doctors who risked their lives \u2014 and confronted thorny questions of medical ethics \u2014 to bring to light the use of chemical weapons.         \n\nSyria\u2019s civil war has been especially dangerous for health professionals; a United Nations  \n issued last month described the \u201cdeliberate targeting of hospitals, medical personnel and transports\u201d as \u201cone of the most alarming features of the Syrian conflict.\u201d By varying estimates, more than 100 doctors have been killed and as many as 600 have been imprisoned.         \n\nThe country\u2019s once-functioning health system is in a shambles. More than half of its public hospitals have been damaged in the two-year-old civil war and 37 percent are out of service entirely, according to a recent  \n by the World Health Organization. Many Syrian doctors have fled; those who remain describe dire conditions where even the most basic care is not available.         \n\nMothers are desperate to have their children vaccinated; patients with chronic conditions like heart disease and  \n struggle to get medicine; and there is \u201chuge anxiety in the population,\u201d said Dr. Adi Nadimpalli, a 38-year-old New Orleans pediatrician and internist who runs two hospitals in northern Syria for the humanitarian group  \n.         \n\nWorking among conflicting rebel factions has proved a delicate task. Dr. Nadimpalli cut a deal with the fighters: \u201cThey check their guns at the door.\u201d         \n\nChemical warfare \u2014 which appeared to begin with small-scale attacks this year and culminated in the sarin gas attack in August that killed hundreds of Syrians \u2014 made that difficult situation even more complex, posing ethical questions about whether, and how, to speak up.         \n\nDoctors Without Borders, also known as M.S.F. for its French name, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, is operating six makeshift hospitals in the rebel-controlled north, without permission from the Assad government. In January, it also began secretly providing technical advice, medical equipment and drugs \u2014 including atropine, an antidote to nerve agents \u2014 to hospitals and clinics in regions controlled by the government.         \n\nOn Aug. 21, the group got word from some of its \u201csilent partner\u201d hospitals of a flood of patients with \u201cneurotoxic symptoms\u201d \u2014 roughly 3,600 in a period of three hours, including 355 who died. Within days, its leaders had convened a conference call to debate how to handle the sensitive information, said Sophie Delaunay, the executive director of Doctors Without Borders\u2019 United States operations.         \n\nAny public statement, she and her colleagues knew, could put the group\u2019s doctors and their Syrian partners at risk, exposing them to accusations of siding with rebels and leaving them vulnerable to retaliation from government forces. And they feared that Western governments, including the Obama administration, could use their words as grounds for a military strike.         \n\nThe group issued a public  \n nonetheless; the information, Ms. Delaunay said, was \u201ctoo big\u201d and \u201ctoo credible\u201d to be withheld. The carefully worded release asked for an independent investigation, saying Doctors Without Borders could \u201cneither scientifically confirm the cause of these symptoms nor establish who is responsible for the attack.\u201d         \n\nSoon, though, Secretary of State John F. Kerry and Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, began  \n Doctors Without Borders\u2019 findings as justification for military intervention, just as the group had feared. It followed with a second statement, cautioning again that its information \u201ccould not be used as evidence\u201d to assign blame.         \n\nA State Department official, speaking anonymously to discuss internal decision making, said that American officials had been gathering intelligence on chemical weapons, and that the work of doctors and humanitarian groups provided \u201cjust another indicator.\u201d         \n\nBut J. Stephen Morrison, a global health expert at the  \n in Washington, said Ms. Delaunay and her colleagues \u201cdeserve an enormous amount of credit\u201d for forcing the issue onto the international agenda. \u201cThey moved the global discussion forward,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was very risky, and a tough call, and things could have gotten ugly for them.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/22/health/in-syria-doctors-risk-life-and-juggle-ethics.html", "date": "2013-10-21", "description": "As Syria moves toward destroying its chemical stockpile, some say the credit lies with doctors who risked their lives \u2014 and confronted questions of medical ethics \u2014 to expose the weapons\u2019 use."}
