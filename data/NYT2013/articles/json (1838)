{"headline": "Wall St. Fears Go Beyond Shutdown", "body": "\nWith Washington preoccupied by the government shutdown, Wall Street is shifting its attention to an even more worrisome situation: the possibility that the government could run out of money within the next few weeks, forcing an unprecedented default on its debt.         \n\nThe Treasury said last week that Congress had until Oct. 17 to raise the limit on how much the federal government could borrow or risk leaving the country on the precipice of default. If the  \n is not raised by then, the Treasury estimates it will be left with about only $30 billion in cash, which would be used up in a matter of days.         \n\nAs a result, economists and investors have quietly begun to explore the options the White House might have in the event Congress fails to act.         \n\nThe most widely discussed strategy would be for  \n to invoke authority under the 14th Amendment and essentially order the federal government to keep borrowing, an option that was endorsed by former President Bill Clinton during an earlier debt standoff in 2011.         \n\nAnd in recent days, prominent Democrats like Senator Max Baucus, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, have urged the White House to seriously consider such a route, even if it might provoke a threat of impeachment from House Republicans and ultimately require the Supreme Court to rule on its legitimacy.         \n\nOther potential October surprises range from the logistically forbidding, like prioritizing payments, issuing i.o.u.\u2019s or selling off gold and other assets, to more fanciful ideas, like minting a trillion-dollar platinum coin.         \n\nSo far, administration officials have continued to insist that there is no plausible alternative to Congressional action on the debt limit.         \n\nIn December 2012, Jay Carney, the White House spokesman, flatly renounced the 14th Amendment option, saying: \u201cI can say that this administration does not believe that the 14th Amendment gives the president the power to ignore the debt ceiling \u2014 period.\u201d And on Wednesday, a senior administration lawyer said that remained the administration\u2019s view.         \n\nStill, some observers outside government in Washington and on Wall Street, citing a game theorylike approach, suggest that the president\u2019s position is more tactical than fundamental, since raising the possibility of a way out for the White House like the constitutional gambit would take the heat off Republicans in Congress to act on its own before the Oct. 17 deadline.         \n\n\u201cIf a default is imminent, the option of raising the debt limit by executive fiat has to be on the table,\u201d said Greg Valliere, chief political strategist at Potomac Research. \u201cDesperate times require desperate measures.\u201d         \n\nSome professional investors echoed his view, which is a reason Wall Street remains hopeful that the economic and financial disaster a government default could usher in will be avoided.         \n\n\u201cAt the end of the day if there is no action and the United States has a default looming, I think President Obama can issue an executive order authorizing the Treasury secretary to make payments,\u201d said David Kotok, chief investment officer of Cumberland Advisors in Sarasota, Fla., which has just over $2 billion under management. \u201cThere\u2019s always been more flexibility in the hands of Treasury than they\u2019ve acknowledged.\u201d         \n\nAccording to some legal theorists, the president could essentially ignore the debt limit imposed by Congress, because the 14th Amendment states that the \u201cvalidity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law,\u201d including for debts like pensions and bounties to suppress insurrections, \u201cshall not be questioned.\u201d         \n\nAbsent Congressional approval for raising the debt limit, the constitutional route or some creative financing plan, the only alternative to default would be to cut spending by as much as a third, financing debt payments and other government obligations out of money coming in from tax receipts and other sources. If continued for more than a few days, that would deliver a shock to the economy that would almost certainly send the nation, and perhaps the global economy, back into a severe recession.         \n\nBefore that could happen, analysts say, the stock market would inevitably plummet. \u201cInvestors will hit the panic button on Oct. 18 if the debt ceiling has not been raised by then,\u201d said Ajay Rajadhyaksha, head of fixed-income research at Barclays. \u201cThe market will force Congress\u2019s hand.\u201d         \n\nThere are precedents for such a denouement. After the House rejected initial legislation authorizing the bank bailout known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program during the financial crisis in late September 2008, the Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 700 points in one trading session, prompting legislators to reverse course and approve a similar bill within days.         \n\nMarket turbulence also helped set the stage for a deal in summer 2011 when Congressional Republicans and Mr. Obama squared off over the debt ceiling but ultimately compromised.         \n\nAfter largely staying on the sidelines as the budget battle approached in recent months, business leaders are also increasing warnings about the danger of a default. On Wednesday, Jacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary, and other White House officials held a conference call with leaders of the Business Roundtable, which represents major American companies. Afterward, both Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. sat down to discuss the issue with Wall Street chieftains, including Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs.         \n\nAnother option, at least in the short term, would be to issue i.o.u.\u2019s to cover some of what is owed and buy more time. The California State government employed this tactic in summer 2009 during a fiscal showdown in Sacramento, issuing 450,000 i.o.u.\u2019s valued at approximately $2.6 billion.         \n\nMark A. Patterson, who served as the Treasury\u2019s chief of staff from 2009 until May 2013 said that he and other top administration officials studied various strategies before the 2011 standoff, including the constitutional path, selling gold and a trillion-dollar coin. \u201cWe would have been thrilled if we had an easy option to take default off the table,\u201d he said Wednesday. \u201cWe examined every idea and concluded that none of them would work.\u201d         \n\nThe idea of invoking the 14th Amendment has been attacked on both constitutional and pragmatic grounds. Some legal scholars said that the amendment did not confer any legal authority on the president, pointing to the words \u201cauthorized by law.\u201d Pragmatically, specialists on Wall Street said questions about the legality of such bonds might cause potential buyers to eschew them.         \n\n\u201cIf there is no borrowing authority, any Treasury debt issued after Oct. 17 could become susceptible to legal challenges,\u201d Mr. Rajadhyaksha of Barclays said.         \n\nWhile the Oct. 17 Treasury deadline will increasingly become the focus in the days ahead, both for politicians in Washington and investors around the world, there may still be a bit of wiggle room after that, said Michelle Girard, chief United States economist at RBS. But not much.         \n\nThe government\u2019s obligations are relatively light in mid-to-late October. That all changes on Nov. 1, when nearly $70 billion has to be paid for  \n,  \n, military paychecks and other obligations.         \n\nWithout additional Treasury borrowing, \u201cit\u2019s impossible to get beyond Nov. 1,\u201d Ms. Girard said. \u201cAnd in our view, even Oct. 31 is too close to be able to sleep comfortably.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/03/business/wall-st-fears-go-beyond-shutdown.html", "date": "2013-10-02", "description": "The prospect of Congress failing to raise the nation\u2019s debt limit has economists and investors exploring options the White House might have."}
