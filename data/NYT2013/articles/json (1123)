{"headline": "Babes in a Digital Toyland: Even 3-Year-Olds Get Gadgets", "body": "\nThe children come day after day, lining up in the cold and snow on Main Street in Midland, Mich., to wait their turn to enter Santa\u2019s house and whisper their Christmas longings to the jolly man in the red suit.         \n\n\u201cCellphone.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIPad.\u201d         \n\n\u201cNotebook.\u201d         \n\nAnd when they say such things, Tom Valent, now in his 38th year as Santa Claus, unleashes his best \u201cHo-ho-ho\u201d and replies: \u201cWell, I\u2019m good at toys. Electronics \u2014 that\u2019s a bit of a challenge.\u201d         \n\nSure, children still want and receive trains and dolls and Legos and other playthings of the type that Santa might make in his North Pole workshop.         \n\nBut their passion for playing with toys seems to be diminishing at earlier and earlier ages. After all, this is a generation that learned to amuse itself practically from babyhood with the smartphone and tablet swiped from their parents\u2019 hands.         \n\nFor Hanukkah this year, Maddon Segall asked for iTunes gift cards and the new iPad Mini. He is 3.         \n\n\u201cI hate to tell you but we got it for him,\u201d said his mother, Elyse Bender-Segall, of Livingston, N.J. She added: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like the toys. I buy him every toy. He\u2019s just not interested in them the way he is with the tech.\u201d         \n\nA recent survey of 1,000 parents with children between 2 and 10 found that more than half planned to buy a tech item for their children this holiday season. About two-thirds of those planned to give a tablet or smartphone, according to the survey, which was taken for PBS Kids, the brand of the public broadcasting network aimed at young children.         \n\n\u201cSmarter Giving With Apps!\u201d shouted the December cover of Manhattan Family, a monthly publication geared to families with young children. The article, written by a kindergarten teacher, noted that \u201ctraditional gifts, like clothes and toys\u201d can be costly \u201cand not always what children are wishing for.\u201d Apps, on the other hand, she wrote, are cost-effective, educational and fun \u2014 the perfect gift.         \n\nIt is a confounding situation for toy-makers, which, according to the Toy Industry Association and statistics compiled by NPD Group, have barely managed to eke out any gains in the past few years. Contributing to the doldrums is the fact that there is no superhot, must-have toy this holiday season \u2014 no 2013 equivalent of the Cabbage Patch doll or the Tickle Me Elmo or even the Zhu Zhu Pet.         \n\nInstead, some in the industry are trying to get a piece of the tech action. While electronic games have long been a staple of toy stores, this year, for the first time, Toys \u201cR\u201d Us introduced hands-on tablet displays in many of its stores, including iPads and Samsung tablets. The company has also designed and developed its own tablet for young children, the Tabeo e2, which, a spokeswoman said, \u201ccomes right out the box with 30 premium apps.\u201d         \n\nOn a recent snowy morning, the first thing holiday shoppers saw after entering the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us flagship store in Times Square (after being welcomed by a man in a giraffe costume) was a sign advertising the iPad.         \n\n\u201cIncreasingly tablets are a key growth category for the company,\u201d said Adrienne O\u2019Hara, the company\u2019s director of consumer public relations.         \n\nBut as the holiday shopping season is wrapping up, some parents have resisted.         \n\nThe Easy Bake Oven, which celebrated its 50th birthday this year, has been a strong seller at Walmart in recent weeks. Hot Wheels are having a good season, industry experts say, as are the Barbie Dream House and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Even Mr. Potato Head is still around.         \n\n\u201cIn many ways, retro is being fueled by the virtualization of toys,\u201d said M. Eric Johnson, dean of the Owen Graduate School of Management at Vanderbilt University, who has studied the toy industry.         \n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a mind-set in a lot of young moms that a physical toy is a good thing, it\u2019s almost a backlash to the popularity of the app,\u201d he said. \u201cSo they head down the toy aisle, and they find something they remember.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/24/business/for-babes-these-days-toyland-has-a-digital-bent.html", "date": "2013-12-23", "description": "Parents with young children are buying them tablets and other devices, while the toy industry stalls, but retro toys, perhaps in a backlash, are resurgent."}
