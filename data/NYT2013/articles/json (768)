{"headline": "Music, Cocktails and \u2018Madeline\u2019 at Bemelmans Bar", "body": "\nBemelmans Bar at the  \n is best known for the murals by the writer and illustrator it\u2019s named after, but it\u2019s the piano men who make the place.         \n\nEarl Rose plays Monday through Thursday nights starting at 5:30, and Robert Mosci is there on weekend evenings this summer. They\u2019re both good reasons to spend considerable time (and not inconsiderable money) at this enduring Upper East Side bar.         \n\nLudwig Bemelmans, author of the \u201cMadeline\u201d children\u2019s books, painted Central Park scenes on the walls, and they\u2019re charming, as are the shades on the table lamps inspired by them. (He did the murals in the 1940s in exchange for lodging at the hotel.) The bar opened in 1947, and the musicians in the murals have played alongside their real-life counterparts for decades, making it a place with a distinctly New York soundtrack.         \n\nMr. Rose has been performing on the Steinway grand at Bemelmans for more than 12 years. \u201cIt\u2019s fabulous,\u201d is how he described the experience. \u201cIt gives me a chance to play all the great Gershwin, Cole Porter, and also a lot of great jazz things \u2014 Duke Ellington, Billy Strayhorn.\u201d         \n\nMr. Mosci, an appealing vocalist, said he focuses on the American songbook, including Rodgers and Hart, and Gershwin. \u201cI always come back to that, no matter what,\u201d he said. \u201cbecause even the young people that go there seem to know that stuff and respond to it.\u201d         \n\nBoth men venture beyond: Mr. Mosci plays Stevie Wonder and Steely Dan, and Mr. Rose may serve up \u201cjazz interpretations\u201d of themes by the Catalan classical composer Federico Mompou or even a Coldplay song.         \n\nAnd then there\u2019s the McCartney factor. Mr. Rose said he plays Paul McCartney\u2019s \u201cMy Valentine\u201d every night. \u201cIt\u2019s a gorgeous song,\u201d he said.         \n\nAs for Mr. Mosci: \u201cPaul McCartney happened to walk in when I was playing his song \u2014 I didn\u2019t see him there. I was playing \u2018The Long and Winding Road,\u2019 and he tapped me on the shoulder and gave me a thumbs up. I almost fell over.\u201d         \n\nThere were no McCartney sightings on my recent visits, but I did see men in their 60s in navy sport coats as well as a man in his 20s in orange shorts whose girlfriend had her foot in his lap. (They were out of context.)         \n\nThe cocktails are pretty good. The Old Cuban is made with Bacardi 8 rum, Angostura bitters, lime juice, muddled mint and a splash of Canard-Duch\u00eane champagne. The Gin-Gin Mule is a long drink made with Gordon\u2019s gin, Regatta ginger beer, simple syrup, muddled mint and fresh lime juice. The La Poire and Ginger has Grey Goose pear vodka, Domaine de Canton ginger liqueur, fresh lemon juice and simple syrup. All go well with summer.         \n\nBut an attempt to order a drink on the menu called a Negronino was unsuccessful because the bar did not have the amaro it is made with; two nights later another customer asked for it, same story. (There are moments when the bar isn\u2019t quite as on-point as you\u2019d expect.)         \n\nIt should be noted that the drinks are expensive: Signature cocktails are $21, and an excellent martini made with Plymouth gin is $21.25. (Martini prices vary by choice of liquor.) Beers on an unsurprising roster are $10 a bottle; a glass of 2011 Il Conte pinot grigio is $18, and Flora Springs cabernet sauvignon from 2009 is $22.         \n\nThere is a cover charge for the music once trios start playing at 9 or 9:30 p.m.: $15 a person at the bar every night, $25 a person at a table Sunday through Thursday, and $30 on Friday and Saturday. (Mr. Rose leads one of those trios, and Chris Gillespie and Matt Baker lead others.)         \n\nAt any hour Bemelmans counts as a splurge, but a worthwhile splurge.         \n\nAnd we had to ask: Do the men at the piano at Bemelmans ever get asked to play Billy Joel\u2019s \u201cPiano Man\u201d?         \n\n\u201cAll the time,\u201d Mr. Mosci said. \u201cI didn\u2019t used to like the song, and I\u2019ve come to like it. I have played in rooms that the words to the song would actually sum up some of the people.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/26/booming/music-cocktails-and-madeline-at-bemelmans-bar.html", "date": "2013-07-25", "description": "Bemelmans Bar at the Carlyle is a splurge but offers pleasures like its piano men, specialty cocktails and signature murals by Ludwig Bemelmans."}
