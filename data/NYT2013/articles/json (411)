{"headline": "Supreme Court Invalidates Key Part of Voting Rights Act", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday  \n the heart of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by a 5-to-4 vote, freeing nine states, mostly in the South, to change their election laws without advance federal approval.         \n\nThe court divided along ideological lines, and the two sides drew sharply different lessons from the history of the civil rights movement and the nation\u2019s progress in rooting out racial discrimination in voting. At the core of the disagreement was whether racial minorities continued to face barriers to voting in states with a history of discrimination.         \n\n\u201cOur country has changed,\u201d Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote for the majority. \u201cWhile any racial discrimination in voting is too much, Congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy that problem speaks to current conditions.\u201d         \n\nThe decision will have immediate practical consequences. Texas announced shortly after the decision that a voter identification law that had been blocked would go into effect immediately, and that redistricting maps there would no longer need federal approval. Changes in voting procedures in the places that had been covered by the law, including ones concerning restrictions on early voting, will now be subject only to after-the-fact litigation.         \n\nPresident Obama, whose election as the nation\u2019s first black president was cited by critics of the law as evidence that it was no longer needed, said he was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by the ruling.         \n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg summarized her  \n from the bench, an unusual move and a sign of deep disagreement. She cited the words of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and said his legacy and the nation\u2019s commitment to justice had been \u201cdisserved by today\u2019s decision.\u201d         \n\nShe said the focus of the Voting Rights Act had properly changed from \u201cfirst-generation barriers to ballot access\u201d to \u201csecond-generation barriers\u201d like racial gerrymandering and laws requiring at-large voting in places with a sizable black minority. She said the law had been effective in thwarting such efforts.         \n\nThe law had applied to nine states \u2014 Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia \u2014 and to scores of counties and municipalities in other states, including Brooklyn, Manhattan and the Bronx.         \n\nChief Justice Roberts wrote that Congress remained free to try to impose federal oversight on states where voting rights were at risk, but must do so based on contemporary data. But the chances that the current Congress could reach agreement on where federal oversight is required are small, most analysts say.         \n\nJustices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. joined the majority opinion. Justice Ginsburg was joined in dissent by Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.         \n\nThe majority held that the coverage formula in Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, originally passed in 1965 and most recently updated by Congress in 1975, was unconstitutional. The section determined which states must receive clearance from the Justice Department or a federal court in Washington before they made minor changes to voting procedures, like moving a polling place, or major ones, like redrawing electoral districts.         \n\nSection 5, which sets out the preclearance requirement, was originally scheduled to expire in five years. Congress repeatedly extended it: for five years in 1970, seven years in 1975, and 25 years in 1982. Congress renewed the act in 2006 after holding extensive hearings on the persistence of racial discrimination at the polls, again extending the preclearance requirement for 25 years. But it relied on data from the 1975 reauthorization to decide  \n.         \n\nThe current coverage system, Chief Justice Roberts wrote, is \u201cbased on 40-year-old facts having no logical relationship to the present day.\u201d         \n\n\u201cCongress \u2014 if it is to divide the states \u2014 must identify those jurisdictions to be singled out on a basis that makes sense in light of current conditions,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt cannot simply rely on the past.\u201d         \n\nThe decision did not strike down Section 5, but without Section 4, the later section is without significance \u2014 unless Congress passes a new bill for determining which states would be covered.         \n\nIt was hardly clear, at any rate, that the court\u2019s conservative majority would uphold Section 5 if the question returned to the court in the unlikely event that Congress enacted a new coverage formula. In a concurrence, Justice Thomas called for striking down Section 5 immediately, saying that the majority opinion had provided the reasons and had merely left \u201cthe inevitable conclusion unstated.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/us/supreme-court-ruling.html", "date": "2013-06-25", "description": "The Supreme Court split along ideological lines with its ruling that Congress had not provided adequate justification for subjecting the states, mostly in the South, to federal oversight."}
