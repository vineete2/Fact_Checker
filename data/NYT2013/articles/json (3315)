{"headline": "If You Like Jos\u00e9 Feliciano, Try Ben Howard", "body": "\n \n  \n         \n\n \n         \n\nSometimes you just want it mellow. A soft melody with an easy tempo can work. But adding the right voice makes everything feel right. The voices of the Puerto Rican guitarist Jos\u00e9 Feliciano and the British singer and songwriter Ben Howard might be better than anything a doctor could order. Take a listen to these two and you won't be calling for help in the morning.         \n\n \n\n \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nA.  \n         \n\nQ.  \n         \n\nYou don\u2019t have to be a game show wiz to know that one. \"Feliciano: A name that is synonymous with \n opens his \n. And he has a back story to prove it. The legendary singer and guitarist  \n Montserrate Feliciano Garc\u00eda was born blind, one of 11 boys. On that alone Mr. Feliciano should be synonymous with survival (I have four boys, I know). At age 5 his family immigrated from Puerto Rico to New York City and his love for music eventually revealed itself in 14-hour-a day self-taught guitar practice. In his mid-teens he quit school to help support the family, playing in clubs and cafes. Robert Shelton of The New York Times heard him at Gerde's Folk City in Greenwich Village and \n as a \"10-fingered wizard who romps, runs, rolls, picks and reverberates his six strings in an incomparable fashion.\"  \nThe next day an RCA music executive, Jack Sommer, signed him. He soon became a teenage idol whose acoustic guitar and soothing vocals could rework any song and make it new.         \n\nRecognized as the first Latin artist to cross over to the English music market, he paved the way with more than 45 gold and platinum records and 9 Grammy awards. Along the way, two supporters in particular offered a suggestion that would lift his career. Another RCA executive, Rick Jarrard, suggested that Mr. Feliciano should cover the Doors' song \"Light My Fire\"; it became one of Mr. Feliciano's signature songs. And it was Ernie Harwell, the famed  \n Tigers' broadcaster, who in 1968 chose Mr. Feliciano to sing the National Anthem at the fifth game of the World Series. \"Using only his voice and an acoustic guitar, Mr. Feliciano delivered a soulful rendition of the \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner,\" \nGene Myers recounted in  \n Detroit Free Press. \"No one had strayed from a straight-laced anthem interpretation, let alone on national television. An uproar ensued across the country.\" Nowadays, that's what artists hope for; a story that goes viral.         \n\n \n\n \n\n \n         \n\n \n\n \n\n \n         \n\nLast summer I went to a small show at Reggie\u2019s Music Joint in Chicago to see one of my favorite emerging artists, the 25-year-old British singer and songwriter Ben Howard. My friend Norm Winer, program director for the Chicago rock station WXRT, sponsor of the show, took me backstage for what I thought would be a two-second meet and greet but turned into an invitation up to the rooftop grill for dinner with the band. (I gave myself a mindful pinch  \n \u2014 thanks, love my job.) Norm seated me right next to Ben. I put out my hand and said: \u201cI\u2019m Val Haller. I run a boutique music Web site that helps busy adults find artists like you.\u201d Donning his trademark sunglasses (\u00e0 la Feliciano), and already smoking a cigarette (I always wonder how singers can smoke) he pronounced the idea brilliant, promised to tell his mother about Valslist and shared some of his favorite bands. We chatted about the music industry, the trends and the difficulty of finding good artists in a tsunami of new music.         \n\nRaised by musical parents and grounded in the songs of Joni Mitchell and Bob Dylan, he started playing guitar at a young age because he liked to \u201cput words together and make stuff up,\u201d he said. Now the stuff he makes up sells out shows everywhere.  \n \"As he plays his acoustic and electric guitars left-handed, Mr. Howard's songs seem to cascade from his fingers, gathering words and melodies as they go, carrying his reedy, tremulous voice as their crescendos surge,\" \n of The Times wrote after a Bowery Ballroom show last year, adding, \"He's a pensive Romantic.\" Mr. Howard's bandmates, India Bourne (cello, bass, drums) and Chris Bond (drums, bass, guitar) add harmonies with perfection. His debut album \"Every Kingdom\" earned him two 2013 Brit Awards (Best Male Solo Artist and Best Breakthrough Act.) Although he has been likened to the 1960s musicians Nick Drake and John Martyn, his voice is more falsetto (hence my choice to pair him with Mr. Feliciano). His 2012 EP \"Burgh Island\" is more ominous-sounding; perfect for a gray day. He\u2019s playing the big stages now, from Kimmel to Letterman, SXSW to Coachella, and he\u2019ll be playing Central Park Summer Stage in New York City on July 29. To see how he connects with audiences, check out this video of him performing \u201cThe Fear.\u201d         \n\n \n\n \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/09/booming/if-you-like-jose-feliciano-try-ben-howard.html", "date": "2013-04-09", "description": "If you like the music of Jos\u00e9 Feliciano, whose acoustic guitar and soothing vocals made him a sensation, then try the singer and guitarist Ben Howard."}
