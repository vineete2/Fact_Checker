{"headline": "Tax Lobby Builds Ties to Chairman of Finance Panel", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Restaurant chains like McDonald\u2019s want to keep their lucrative tax credit for hiring veterans. Altria, the tobacco giant, wants to cut the corporate tax rate. And Sapphire Energy, a small alternative energy company, is determined to protect a tax incentive it believes could turn algae into a popular motor fuel.         \n\nTo make their case as Congress prepares to debate a rewrite of the nation\u2019s tax code, this diverse set of businesses has at least one strategy in common: they have retained firms that employ lobbyists who are former aides to  \n, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which will have a crucial role in shaping any legislation.         \n\nNo other lawmaker on Capitol Hill has such a sizable constellation of former aides working as tax lobbyists, representing blue-chip clients that include telecommunications businesses, oil companies, retailers and financial firms, according to an analysis by  \n, an online database that tracks Congressional staff members and lobbying. At least 28 aides who have worked for Mr. Baucus, Democrat of Montana, since he became the committee chairman in 2001 have lobbied on tax issues during the Obama administration \u2014 more than any other current member of Congress, according to the analysis of lobbying filings performed for The New York Times.         \n\n\u201cK Street is literally littered with former Baucus staffers,\u201d said Jade West, an executive at a wholesalers\u2019 trade association that relies on a former finance panel aide,  \n \u201cIt opens doors that allow you to make the case.\u201d         \n\nLike Ms. Baker, many of those lobbyists have already saved their clients millions \u2014 in some cases, billions \u2014 of dollars after  \n their requests to extend certain corporate tax perks, provisions that were adopted as part of the so-called fiscal cliff legislation in January. Baucus aides who later became lobbyists helped financial firms save $11.2 billion in tax deferments and helped secure a $222 million tax benefit that is shared with the liquor industry.         \n\nSean Neary, a spokesman for Mr. Baucus, said the senator had regularly rejected requests from those lobbyists for provisions benefiting their clients, like an appeal from one former aide,  \n, now working as a  \n, to extend an alternative grant in lieu of tax credit program that expired in 2011.         \n\nMr. Baucus\u2019s decisions are based on the merits of the policies, Mr. Neary said, not on who is advocating for them. \u201cThe fact is, oftentimes good policy can indirectly benefit someone,\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean it shouldn\u2019t be done.\u201d         \n\nThe debate over the tax code \u2014 which has emerged as part of the two-year effort to stimulate the economy and reduce the deficit \u2014 could turn into a battle royal. While many members of Congress talk about lowering the corporate tax rate, replacing that lost revenue would require eliminating many tax loopholes that legions of lobbyists, including many who had worked for other prominent lawmakers, make a living laboring to expand or defend.         \n\nMr. Baucus, 71, the son of a wealthy Montana rancher, is somewhat of a wild card in the tax debate: he is the top Democrat in what arguably is the Senate\u2019s most powerful committee seat. The finance panel helps dictate how the government raises almost all of its money, and spends nearly half of it.         \n\nBut he often bucks his party\u2019s leadership. Last month, for example,  \n against the Democrats\u2019 budget proposal for 2014, which included nearly $1 trillion in new revenues. He also favored the Bush administration\u2019s tax cuts in 2001 for Americans including the wealthy, putting him  \n         \n\nMr. Baucus, who has spent nearly his entire professional career in Congress, declined a request for an interview. But Mr. Neary said that every action the senator takes is motivated by his commitment to voters.         \n\n\u201cEvery vote has to answer one question for him and that is: How is it impacting Montanans?\u201d Mr. Neary said.         \n\nSeveral veteran Capitol Hill aides said it was na\u00efve to suggest that former aides could extract special favors from their one-time bosses \u2014 unless what they were pushing for had broad support. But the former aides still bring an advantage to the corporations that hire them.         \n\n\u201cIt does mean you will have someone who knows how the levers of power are pushed or how to push the levers, and who can describe to you how situations are going to play out based on their years of experience,\u201d said  \n, a former aide to Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader. Mr. Manley now works at a Washington lobbying and communications firm, QGA Public Affairs.         \n\nIn recent interviews, four former aides to Mr. Baucus said that their ties to him heightened their appeal to potential clients. The link also helped justify their salaries, in some cases $500,000 or higher, more than double or triple their Capitol Hill paychecks.         \n\nFormer Senate aides who become lobbyists must wait a year before they can contact Mr. Baucus or his staff on behalf of a client, according to  \n.         \n\nStaying active in their circle, one former aide said, also requires that they help Mr. Baucus\u2019s political career, through fund-raising and other assistance.         \n\nSeveral of the lobbyists regularly fly to Big Sky, Mont., for  \n that Mr. Baucus hosts, or attend more intimate events in Washington like a gathering last month near the Capitol, where Paul Wilkins, Mr. Baucus\u2019s chief of staff, talked about the millions of dollars Mr. Baucus will need to raise for his re-election campaign next year.         \n\nAmong them, the top givers include  \n Mr. Baucus\u2019s former Finance Committee staff director, who has donated a total of at least $25,000 to Mr. Baucus, his political action committee or the Montana Democratic Party. He attended the retreat in February at the Big Sky resort, which included skiing, snowmobiling and a big family dinner at Buck\u2019s T-4 Lodge. The totals grow much bigger \u2014 to hundreds of thousands of dollars \u2014 when donations from Mr. Forbes\u2019s clients, including  \n and  \n and other partners at his lobbying firm, are counted.         \n\nMr. Wilkins said that the donations and fund-raising had been vital, noting that the nearly $4.6 million expected in hand by the end of this month would rank Mr. Baucus\u2019s campaign chest among the top 10 in the Senate.
