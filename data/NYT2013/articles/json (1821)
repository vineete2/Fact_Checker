{"headline": "Staunch Group of Republicans Outflanks House Leaders", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 They have had their fleeting moments on cable television. Their closed-door run-ins with Speaker  \n spill occasionally into the pages of Capitol Hill newspapers. But outside their districts, and sometimes even within them, few have heard of the conservative cadre of House Republicans who have led the charge to shut down the government.         \n\nIn contrast to 1995, when Speaker Newt Gingrich led his band of \u201crevolutionary\u201d Republicans into the last battle that shuttered the federal government, this time a small but powerful group of outspoken conservative hard-liners is leading its leaders \u2014 and increasingly angering a widening group of fellow Republicans.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve passed the witching hour of midnight, and the sky didn\u2019t fall, nothing caved in,\u201d said Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, who still believes Republicans can achieve \u201cthe end of Obamacare.\u201d \u201cNow the pressure will build on both sides, and the American people will weigh in.\u201d         \n\nMr. King is part of a hard-core group of about two dozen or so of the most conservative House members who stand in the way of a middle path for Mr. Boehner that could keep most of his party unified while pressuring the Senate to compromise. Their numbers may be small, but they are large enough to threaten the speaker\u2019s job if he were to turn to Democrats to pass a spending bill that reopened the government without walloping the health law. Their strategy is to yield no ground until they are able to pass legislation reining in the  \n; if the federal government stays closed, so be it.         \n\nAnd they believe they are winning.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting better for us,\u201d said Representative Ra\u00fal R. Labrador, Republican of Idaho. \u201cThe moment where Republicans are least popular is right when the government shuts down. But when the president continues to say he\u2019s unwilling to negotiate with the American people, when Harry Reid says he won\u2019t even take things to conference, I don\u2019t think the American people are going to take that too kindly.\u201d         \n\nRepresentative Jeff Duncan, Republican of South Carolina, also did not flinch.         \n\n\u201cWe feel strongly enough\u201d to hold the line, he said. \u201cI was elected in 2010. I feel Obamacare is shutting down America.\u201d         \n\nFor nearly three years, Mr. Boehner has been vexed by an ungovernable conservative group made up of ideologically committed conservatives from safe House seats. The group has defied his leadership, rallied others to its cause and worn its gadfly status proudly. Earlier this year, the speaker disregarded them and passed three major bills that attracted only a minority of his party. Instead, he relied on Democratic votes to pass a budget plan that allowed taxes to rise on the rich, relief for victims of  \n and an expansion of the Violence Against Women Act.         \n\nThat nucleus of that group has stuck in the leadership\u2019s craw for some time. Representative Justin Amash, Republican of Michigan, has voted against Republican positions 136 times in his short stretch in Congress. Representative Paul Broun, Republican of Georgia, has voted no on Republican motions 84 times. Representative Thomas Massie, a freshman from Kentucky, is rising in the pesky ranks with 91 no votes in nine months.         \n\nIn March, Representatives Matt Salmon and David Schweikert, both Arizona Republicans, responded with a threat to bring down any bill that did not have overwhelming Republican support through procedural maneuvers. The speaker has refrained ever since.         \n\nBut the influence of the group is sparking an internal backlash, as a growing band of moderate and institutional Republicans are demanding that Mr. Boehner stand up to the conservatives \u2014 to reopen the government and reach bipartisan accommodations in the future.         \n\n\u201cYou have somewhere between 180 and 200 Republican governance votes in the House, and going forward on this issue and many other issues, we\u2019re going to have to find a coalition of Democrats to work with,\u201d said Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania, \u201cand recognize there is going to be a few dozen people on the Republican side who just aren\u2019t going to be there on a lot of these major governance matters.\u201d         \n\nWith much of the government shut down, patience is wearing thin among some Republicans who see the maneuvering of the coalition of conservatives as counterproductive. In 2011, the hard-liners insisted on including a constitutional amendment to balance the budget in a House spending-cut bill, splitting the Republicans in a way that many believe led to fewer cuts in the final Budget Control Act than they would have had otherwise. In December, when they brought down the speaker\u2019s proposal to let taxes rise on incomes over $1 million, Mr. Boehner was left with two choices: let the  \n expire for everyone, or accept a bipartisan Senate plan that raised taxes on households earning over $400,000. He chose the latter.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not suggesting their motives are not legitimately felt, but you get to a point where we can accomplish something here, but we\u2019re watching the speaker constrained on what he can deliver, a practical promise from a united House,\u201d said Representative Patrick Meehan, Republican of Pennsylvania. \u201cWe retreat from a position of strength and accept something that\u2019s worse.\u201d         \n\nNow, many Republicans believe conservative demands to inflict real damage to the health care law is letting slip away the chance to make more realistic changes to the law, like a repeal of its tax on medical devices.         \n\n\u201cThey have never followed any leadership plan, and now all of a sudden the leadership has adopted their plans and we\u2019re fully implementing their strategy and plan, which is I think is actually a lack of a strategy,\u201d said Devin Nunes, Republican of California.         \n\nHouse Republicans were seething Tuesday after two of the most ardent conservatives, Representatives Broun and Phil Gingrey of Georgia, voted against a House Republican bill that linked further government funding to a measure to deny federal subsidies to members of Congress and their staff, who must buy their health insurance on the health law\u2019s new insurance exchanges. The proposal is unpopular with staff members who would have to cover the full costs of their insurance, unlike most public and private sector jobs where employers pick up part of the premiums.         \n\nThey said the vote was unexpected because two weeks ago Mr. Gingrey stood at a closed-door party meeting and said members concerned about hurting their staff were misguided, since they would just go to lobbying firms \u201cdowntown\u201d and make a half-million dollars a year.         \n\n\u201cThe congressman made a pledge that he would not vote for a  \n that funded Obamacare. That was the compelling factor in his vote last night,\u201d said a Gingrey spokeswoman, Jen Talaber.         \n\nThe conservatives remain resolute against compromises, even some embraced by Republican leaders. Representative John Fleming, Republican of Louisiana, said he could not accept a repeal of the health law\u2019s tax on medical devices as a concession to reopen the government.         \n\n\u201cThat could be bad because it could improve a bad bill,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd while it\u2019s a terrible tax, removing a tax to make what is really an atrocious bill to the economy slightly better, I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d         \n\nTo many Senate Republicans, the House\u2019s position has now become mystifying.         \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t blame them for anything other than being sold a line that wouldn\u2019t work, seeing the outside support and saying \u2018maybe, maybe, maybe,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina, said of House conservatives. \u201cWell, you know that train only in a children\u2019s story actually gets to the top of the hill.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/02/us/politics/a-committed-group-of-conservatives-outflanks-the-house-leadership.html", "date": "2013-10-01", "description": "A powerful group of conservative hard-liners is leading party bosses in the House, and increasingly angering a widening group of fellow Republicans."}
