{"headline": "Roberts\u2019s Picks Reshaping Secret Surveillance Court", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The recent leaks about government spying programs have focused attention on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and its role in deciding how intrusive the \u00a0government can be in the name of national security. Less mentioned has been the person who has been quietly reshaping the secret court: Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.         \n\nIn making assignments to the court, Chief Justice Roberts, more than his predecessors, has chosen judges with conservative and executive branch backgrounds that critics say make the court more likely to defer to government arguments that domestic spying programs are necessary.         \n\nTen of the court\u2019s 11 judges \u2014 all assigned by Chief Justice Roberts \u2014 were appointed to the bench by Republican presidents; six once worked for the federal government. Since the chief justice began making assignments in 2005, 86 percent of his choices have been Republican appointees, and 50 percent have been former executive branch officials.         \n\nThough the two previous chief justices, Warren E. Burger and William H. Rehnquist, were conservatives like Chief Justice Roberts, their assignments to the surveillance court were more ideologically diverse, according to an analysis by The New York Times of a  \n who has served on the court since it was established in 1978.         \n\nAccording to the analysis, 66 percent of their selections were Republican appointees, and 39 percent once worked for the executive branch.         \n\n\u201cViewing this data, people with responsibility for national security ought to be very concerned about the impression and appearance, if not the reality, of bias \u2014 for favoring the executive branch in its applications for warrants and other action,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat and one of several lawmakers who have sought to change the way the court\u2019s judges are selected.         \n\nMr. Blumenthal, for example, has  \n that each of the chief judges of the 12 major appeals courts select a district judge for the surveillance court; the chief justice would still pick the review panel that hears rare appeals of the court\u2019s decisions, but six other Supreme Court justices would have to sign off. Another  \n by Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, would give the president the power to nominate judges for the court, subject to Senate approval.         \n\nChief Justice Roberts, through a Supreme Court spokeswoman, declined to comment.         \n\nThe court\u2019s complexion has changed at a time when its role has been expanding beyond what Congress envisioned when it established the court as part of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The idea then was that judges would review applications for wiretaps to make sure there was sufficient evidence that the F.B.I.\u2019s target was a foreign terrorist or a spy.         \n\nBut, increasingly in recent years, the court has produced  \n based on procedures devised not for complex legal analysis but for up-or-down approvals of secret wiretap applications. The rulings are classified and based on theories submitted by the Justice Department without the participation of any lawyers offering contrary arguments or appealing a ruling if the government wins.         \n\nThe court \u201cis becoming ever more important in American life as more and more surveillance comes under its review in this era of big data,\u201d said Timothy Edgar, a civil liberties adviser for intelligence issues in both the Bush and Obama administrations. \u201cIf the court is seen as skewed or biased, politically or ideologically, it will lose credibility.\u201d         \n\nAt a  \n, Judge James Robertson, an appointee of President Bill Clinton who was assigned to the surveillance court in 2002 by Chief Justice Rehnquist and resigned from it in December 2005, offered an insider\u2019s critique of how rapidly and recently the court\u2019s role has changed. He said, for example, that during his time it was not engaged in developing a body of secret precedents interpreting what the law means.         \n\n\u201cIn my experience, there weren\u2019t any opinions,\u201d he said. \u201cYou approved a warrant application or you didn\u2019t \u2014 period.\u201d         \n\nThe court began expanding its role when George W. Bush was president and its members were still assigned by Chief Justice Rehnquist, who died in 2005. Midway through the Bush administration, the executive branch sought and obtained  \n blessing to continue secret surveillance programs that had originally circumvented the FISA process.         \n\nThe court\u2019s power has also recently expanded in another way. In 2008, Congress passed the FISA Amendments Act to allow the National Security Agency to keep conducting a form of the Bush administration\u2019s program of surveillance without warrants on domestic soil so long as only foreigners abroad were targeted. It gave the court the power to create rules for the program, like how the government may use Americans\u2019 communications after they are picked up.
