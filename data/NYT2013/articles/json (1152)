{"headline": "Cool for Cats", "body": "\nPHOENIX \u2014 If there is a stylish product made for cats, chances are Kate Benjamin owns it or has written about it. Or both.         \n\nMs. Benjamin, 42, started blogging about her favorite things for cats in 2007, and over time a business began to emerge. Readers posted fan mail. Boutique manufacturers started advertising on her site and sending samples for her to review. And the number of cats in her 1,100-square-foot condominium grew. (At last count, she had 11.)         \n\nAs her advertising revenue climbed, Ms. Benjamin quit her day job as the marketing director of Boon, a company that sells modern baby products, and opened a design studio where she and her employees could create cat toys and accessories to sell on her website. And last year, she re-branded her Moderncat blog as  \n, an \u201conline magazine for design-conscious cat people.\u201d         \n\nNext on the horizon is a consulting business built around the concept of \u201ccatification\u201d: tailoring your living space to the needs of your cat without sacrificing aesthetics.         \n\n\u201cThe idea is to influence the mass cat-product industry to step up their game,\u201d said Ms. Benjamin, who has teamed up with Jackson Galaxy, the cat behaviorist from the television show  \n for this effort. \u201cWe just want to be the go-to source for anyone who wants to live stylishly with cats.\u201d         \n\nAs the tattoo on her arm announces, Ms. Benjamin is positioning herself as a cat lady for a new generation. A vegan with Bettie Page bangs, she has upended the old stereotype of the frumpy, middle-aged woman surrounded by cats. And her two-bedroom townhouse here is a showcase of the latest in feline interior design.         \n\nThe living room is filled with all manner of cat beds, scratchers, hiding spots and perches, including a miniature sun bed attached to sliding glass doors that open to  \n (a patio enclosed for the protection of her cats). The centerpiece on the dining table is not a flower arrangement or a fruit bowl, but a white porcelain cat bed designed to look like a sink. On the coffee table is a thronelike cat lounge that doubles as a scratcher. And a huge basket of cat toys is stationed next to the sofa.         \n\n\u201cIt is a little bit over the top,\u201d said Ms. Benjamin, who admits to showering in the second bathroom because the master bath has been given over to litter boxes. But that\u2019s all right, she said, because it means the cats \u201call have lots of options. Rarely is there a fight over places to sit.\u201d         \n\nThe crush of cat products is an inevitable consequence of having a blog that serves up a different item every day, along with a dose of attitude you won\u2019t find in the plain-vanilla pages of a magazine like Cat Fancy.         \n\nReaders leave comments, some gushing, others critical, as well as suggestions. (The new site gets about 150,000 page views a month, she said, but it is still building traffic; the old site, which she shuttered to avoid a lawsuit with a Canadian magazine that had adopted the Modern Cat name, got around 350,000.) The product manufacturers, which tend to be mom-and-pop shops, use the feedback to refine their wares and develop new items \u2014 which, of course, they send to Ms. Benjamin to review.         \n\nSome of these companies advertise on her site or have affiliate arrangements with Ms. Benjamin, who gets a flat fee or a percentage of sales when a customer clicks through from her blog and buys something (although she won\u2019t say exactly how much that amounts to over the course of a year). But others pay nothing to be on her site.         \n\n\u201cI keep my editorial honest and straightforward, regardless of whether or not I\u2019m receiving any compensation,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of my favorite things to do is to help promote a new or small company just because they make great products that my readers need to know about.\u201d         \n\nAs far as she is concerned, she said, what it comes down to is good design.         \n\n\u201cI would like to see every cat in a happy, loving, forever home, and I want to keep them there through design,\u201d said Ms. Benjamin, who studied environmental design and analysis, with an emphasis on interior design, at Cornell and branched out into industrial design and visual communications at Arizona State University. \u201cBecause if somebody doesn\u2019t want to buy a scratcher because the scratchers are so ugly, and then the cat scratches on the sofa, the cat\u2019s booted onto the street or taken to the shelter. If a product design can help change that, that\u2019s where I want to see this go.\u201d         \n\nThe people whose products appear on Hauspanther credit Ms. Benjamin with helping to build the market for designer cat furniture, a small but growing category. Once her blog became a go-to place for furnishings that appealed equally to cats and their owners, these vendors say, more specialty retailers cropped up, widening the product mix, and big chain stores like Walmart and Target began carrying nicer-looking cat products.
