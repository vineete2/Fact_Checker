{"headline": "Flying With the Black Ravens", "body": "\nMy father, Peter Rodrick, the commanding officer of VAQ-135, was killed when his EA-6B Prowler crashed in the Indian Ocean off the U.S.S. Kitty Hawk when I was 13 and he was 36. To me, Dad was a hero, but he was an apparition as well, gone 200 days of the year from when I was 6 until he died. He was such a ghost that I didn\u2019t fully accept he was really gone for years.         \n\nThirty years after his death, I decided to follow the aviators of VAQ-135, the Black Ravens, Dad\u2019s old squadron, joining them for the last of an eight-month deployment on the U.S.S. Nimitz in 2010. I wanted to understand his life better. What did it mean for him to leave his family behind?         \n\nOn the Nimitz, Lt. Cmdr. Scott (Sherm) Oliver helped me fill in the gaps. He took me up to the deck at night. I watched jets land on a speck of America floating in a black sea. I was ecstatic, bouncing up on the toes of my flight boots, looking for the next plane to emerge out of the night. But then the idea that I never had and never would have a conversation with Dad about what it\u2019s like to land on a carrier became unbearable. I went down to my stateroom and wept.         \n\nBy the time the Nimitz pulled into Bremerton, Wash., most of the aviators had flown the squadron\u2019s planes off the carrier, but one officer, Sherm, had volunteered to stay onboard and supervise the offload of equipment. There was no one waiting for him, he reasoned. His wife had moved back to North Carolina with their two boys.         \n\nAround 11 a.m., the Nimitz gracefully slid into its berth. A band played, the gangway dropped; first-time fathers disembarked first, regardless of rank, to their wives and families waiting below. Later that afternoon, Sherm and I made the long drive north to the Black Ravens\u2019 home base on Whidbey Island. We pulled into his driveway in the nearby town of Anacortes just as last light was fading.         \n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get this over with,\u201d Sherm said in a soft voice.         \n\nHe took a breath and got out of the car. He turned the key and opened the door. The house was giant and modern, a Pottery Barn showroom after closing time. But there was no sign of life. His kids\u2019 closets were bare except for some sad, stray reminders. A Mickey Mouse Halloween costume hung alone in the boys\u2019 bedroom. A child\u2019s finger painting had fallen off the refrigerator and was curled up on the kitchen floor.         \n\nSherm didn\u2019t say anything. His blue eyes were unreadable. We made a run into town and bought some beer. Back at the house, Sherm wanted to show me something, a video from his time flying over Iraq during the second gulf war. He popped the DVD into a giant plasma-screen television in his living room. Between the television and the couch there was a circular Fisher-Price train track complete with a ride-along engine and caboose. It had been too big to pack. Sherm turned up the sound on the TV. \u201cThis was one of the greatest moments of my life,\u201d he said.         \n\nSoon we were over Iraq in the first days of the air war. Sherm was filming it all with a hand-held camera. The Prowlers were fitted with missiles designed to destroy Iraqi radar stations. \u201cWatch this,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe track on an Iraqi missile site. Then we fire a HARM missile.\u201d         \n\nOn the screen, Sherm\u2019s Prowler jumped a bit, and a flash of white light fired off from the left wing. Sherm laughed and pointed at a darker spot on the screen. \u201cWe locked in on an Iraqi radar station. So we fired a missile, and we didn\u2019t see this B-52. And for a second we thought, We\u2019re going to hit the B-52. But it went way over the B-52\u2019s head. And then it went down and it did its job.\u201d         \n\nListening to Sherm\u2019s story, I thought about a trip I planned with my father just before he died. I was supposed to fly out to Hawaii in December 1979 and ride back on the Kitty Hawk from Pearl Harbor to San Diego. Finally I\u2019d understand what he loved so much about the Navy, maybe even more than he loved me. But then he crashed, and I was lost.         \n\nSherm restarted the DVD. We watched it a few more times. Then he told me something I already knew.         \n\n\u201cI love what I do for a living,\u201d he said. \u201cI just love it. It\u2019s my life.\u201d         \n\nSherm stepped over his boys\u2019 toys. For a second, I thought he was going to say something about what this life had cost him. But he just clicked off the television and got each of us another beer.
