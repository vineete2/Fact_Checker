{"headline": "Secret Bids Guide Hopi Indians\u2019 Spirits Home", "body": "\nThe auction in Paris was set to move briskly, at about two items a minute; the room was hot and crowded, buzzing with reporters.         \n\nMore than 100 American Indian artifacts were about to go on sale at the Drouot auction house, including 24 pieces, resembling masks, that are held sacred by the Hopi of Arizona. The tribe, United States officials and others had tried unsuccessfully to block the sale in a French court, arguing that the items were religious objects that had been stolen many years ago.         \n\nNow the Annenberg Foundation decided to get involved from its offices in Los Angeles. It hoped to buy all of the Hopi artifacts, plus three more sought by the San Carlos Apaches, at the Dec. 9 sale and return them to the tribes. To prevent prices from rising, the foundation kept its plan a secret, even from the Hopis, in part to protect the tribe from potential disappointment. Given the nine-hour time difference, the foundation put together a team that could work well into the night, bidding by phone in the auction in France.         \n\nThe foundation had never done something like this before \u2014 a repatriation effort \u2014 and the logistics were tricky, to say the least.         \n\nTwo staff members in Los Angeles, one a French speaker, were assigned to the job. The foundation also quietly arranged for a Paris lawyer, Pierre Servan-Schreiber, who had represented the Hopi pro bono in the court proceeding, to serve as lookout in the auction room.         \n\nHe stood in the back, on the phone to the foundation. Whispering updates to him was Philip J. Breeden, a cultural attach\u00e9 from the United States Embassy.         \n\n\u201cIt was intense, like a movie,\u201d Mr. Servan-Schreiber said.         \n\nBut camouflaging the role of the foundation was crucial.         \n\n\u201cI knew nothing good would come out of it if the house knew there were people out to get the whole thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI was sure that would jack up the prices.\u201d         \n\nThe sale had been assembled by the auction house EVE with pieces from a variety of American tribes that were held by a number of French collectors, all of whom said they had owned the items for many years and had good title to them. Several collectors said they had been impressed by prices realized at an April auction of 70 Hopi artifacts.         \n\nThe tribe had been angered by the earlier sale as well, which like this auction featured vibrantly decorated Hopi headdresses, known as Katsinam. The tribe, which had gone to court to block both sales, believes the items are not simply religious, but living entities with divine spirits.         \n\nGregory Annenberg Weingarten, vice president and director of the foundation who lives in Paris, had followed the legal battle in the French news media. After the Hopi lost in court on Dec. 6, he went to the auction house to preview the artifacts, all of which are more than a century old.         \n\n\u201cThese are not trophies to have on one\u2019s mantel,\u201d Mr. Weingarten would say later. \u201cThey are truly sacred works for the Native Americans. They do not belong in auction houses or private collections.\u201d         \n\nMr. Weingarten had his California staff tally the presale estimates from the auction catalog and confirm that the objects were authentic. The staff members also became familiar with the Hopi belief system and built a database that would allow them to follow online the bidding on the objects they wanted. Mr. Weingarten approved a budget of $500,000 to $1 million to buy all 27 disputed Native American lots \u2014 the 24 masklike Hopi artifacts and three items of divine significance to the San Carlos Apache, also in Arizona. To do so he tapped into a discretionary fund set aside for individual projects.         \n\n\u201cIt was a leap-of-faith kind of moment for us,\u201d said Leonard J. Aube, executive director of the foundation, which was founded by Walter H. Annenberg, the publisher, philanthropist and diplomat. \u201cNot a lot of foundations are geared up for this kind of clandestine, late-night activity.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/17/arts/design/secret-bids-guide-hopi-indians-spirits-home.html", "date": "2013-12-16", "description": "The Annenberg Foundation bought more than $500,000 in sacred artifacts at a Paris auction to restore them to the Hopi Indians in Arizona."}
