{"headline": "Step Away From the Phone!", "body": "\nWhenever Michael Carl, the fashion market director at Vanity Fair, goes out to dinner with friends, he plays something called the \u201cphone stack\u201d game: Everyone places their phones in the middle of the table; whoever looks at their device before the check arrives picks up the tab.         \n\nBrandon Holley, the former editor of Lucky magazine, had trouble ditching her iPhone when she got home from work. So about six months ago, she began tossing her phone into a vintage milk tin the moment she walked in. It remains there until after dinner.         \n\nAnd Marc Jacobs, the fashion designer, didn\u2019t want to sleep next to a beeping gizmo. So he banned digital devices from his bedroom, a house rule he shared with audiences during a recent screening of \u201cDisconnect,\u201d a film that dramatizes how technology has alienated people from one other.         \n\nAs smartphones continue to burrow their way into our lives, and wearable devices like Google Glass threaten to erode our personal space even further, overtaxed users are carving out their own device-free zones with ad hoc tricks and life hacks.         \n\nWhether it\u2019s a physical barrier (no iPads at the dinner table) or a conceptual one (turn off devices by 11 p.m.), users say these weaning techniques are improving their relationships \u2014 and their sanity.         \n\n\u201cDisconnecting is a luxury that we all need,\u201d said Lesley M. M. Blume, a New York writer who keeps her phone away from the dinner table at home. \u201cThe expectation that we must always be available to employers, colleagues, family: it creates a real obstacle in trying to set aside private time. But that private time is more important than ever.\u201d         \n\nMuch of the digital detoxing is centered on the home, where urgent e-mails from co-workers, texts from friends, Instagram photos from acquaintances and YOLO updates on Facebook conspire to upend domestic tranquillity.         \n\nA popular tactic is to designate a kind of cellphone lockbox, like the milk tin that Ms. Holley uses. \u201cIf my phone is buzzing or lighting up, it\u2019s still a distraction, so it goes in the box,\u201d said Ms. Holley, who lives in a row house in Red Hook, Brooklyn, with her son, Smith, and husband, John. \u201cIt\u2019s not something I want my kid to see.\u201d         \n\nAn empty fishbowl, which sits on a dining room credenza, serves a similar function for Jaime David, a publicist at the Starworks Group in New York, except there are consequences for violators. \u201cIf someone picks up the phone between 6:30 and 8:30 p.m. without a really good reason, they are tasked with getting our son to bed,\u201d said Ms. David, who lives in Maplewood, N.J., with her husband, Jon, and two sons, Milo, 4, and Jack, 10 months.         \n\nOthers assign a digital curfew. \u201cNo screens after 11 p.m.,\u201d said Ari Melber, a host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cT \n,\u201d who lives in a walk-up apartment in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, with his fianc\u00e9e, Drew Grant, a pop culture reporter at The New York Observer. The rule was instituted in January, after a vacation in Honduras where the couple found themselves without Internet access and ultimately happy about it.         \n\n\u201cWe found the evenings were more relaxing, and we were sleeping better,\u201d Mr. Melber said.         \n\nSleep is a big factor, which is why some, like Mr. Jacobs, draw the gadget-free line at the bedroom. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sleep next to something that is a charged ball of information with photos and e-mails,\u201d said Peter Som, the fashion designer, who keeps his phone plugged in in the living room overnight. \u201cIt definitely is a head-clearer and delineates daytime and sleep time.\u201d         \n\nHouseholds with young children are especially mindful about being overconnected, with parents sensitive to how children may imitate bad habits.         \n\nRebecca Minkoff, a fashion designer, makes a point of turning off the ringers and leaving her two phones on the opposite end of her Dumbo apartment when she plays with her 2-year-old son, Luca. \u201cIt isn\u2019t easy, but I do my best to make the few hours I have with my son cellphone-free until he goes to sleep,\u201d Ms. Minkoff said.
