{"headline": "Cardinals\u2019 Roster Feels Two Players Short", "body": "\nST. LOUIS \u2014 The Boston Red Sox are one win away from a World Series championship while hitting .205. The St. Louis Cardinals are one game from elimination while hitting .218. No team has allowed more than four earned runs in a game.         \n\nThis happens a lot in the postseason, when pitching dominates, and perhaps there was no way the Cardinals could beat Jon Lester in Game 5 on Monday at Busch Stadium. They could hardly touch him in Game 1, either, and went quietly this time in a 3-1 defeat.         \n\nBut the Cardinals\u2019 curious roster construction hurt their cause. Manager Mike Matheny carries two pitchers, Shelby Miller and Edward Mujica, in whom he has seemingly lost all confidence. Both had strong seasons but grew fatigued near the end, and they have combined for three innings this postseason, none in the World Series.         \n\nYet they remain on the roster, which limited Matheny\u2019s bench options with one out in the eighth inning, after David Freese doubled. Matheny let Pete Kozma, the worst hitter in the majors among everyday players, bat for himself, and Kozma predictably hit a lazy fly to left. He is 0 for 10 in the World Series and 5 for 35 in the postseason.         \n\n\u201cWith a left-hander on the mound, we only have our backup catcher as a right-handed bat, unless we throw another lefty in there,\u201d Matheny said. \u201cPete also, even though it\u2019s been a tough offensive season for him, he\u2019s been able to get some big hits for us at times. We needed him to come up big for us.\u201d         \n\nKozma hit .217 this season, with a .275 on-base percentage and a .273 slugging percentage. His .548 on-base plus slugging was the lowest in the National League in 21 years for a player who appeared in at least 140 games. It is hard to imagine worse options as the tying run in the eighth inning of a World Series game.         \n\nThe Cardinals do not have many appealing bench options \u2014 they deactivated the little-used outfielder Adron Chambers to get Allen Craig on the roster for the World Series. Rob Johnson was 6 for 35 this season and is off the roster, like Brock Peterson, who was 2 for 26.         \n\nBut Matheny is effectively operating with a 23-man roster, which hurt him Monday when he needed better options. He defended the inclusion of the forgotten Miller and Mujica on his roster.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always hindsight, and hindsight is usually always right,\u201d Matheny said. \u201cRight now we like the way our bench is being lined up. We had to stack it right-handed with our starters, so we didn\u2019t have a whole lot of options on our bench.         \n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t feel we\u2019ve been that short. But we have extra guys down in the pen just in case we get in situations that we don\u2019t predict. We\u2019ve been covered in most situations over all.\u201d         \n\nKozma was the last player to face Lester, who gave way to closer Koji Uehara for the last out of the eighth. Uehara struck out pinch-hitter Matt Adams and worked a 1-2-3 ninth to send the teams back to Fenway for Game 6 on Wednesday.         \n\nThe teams finished the regular season with identical 97-65 records, and both finished their championship series in six games. They split their first four games together, making this only the second World Series in the last 10 to be even through Game 4. But it was a wild right to get there.         \n\nThe Cardinals made three errors, and at least two more misplays, in losing Game 1. In each of the next two games, the Red Sox allowed the go-ahead run to score on a wild throw from the home plate area to third base. The second of those, Game 3, was the first World Series game to end with an obstruction call. Then came Sunday, when the Red Sox won the first World Series game ever to end with a pickoff.         \n\nBlunders, of course, are part of World Series lore. Babe Ruth was caught stealing \u2014 with Bob Meusel batting and Lou Gehrig on deck \u2014 to end Game 7 in 1926. Bill Buckner, Tony Fernandez and Mariano Rivera made crucial errors in potential or definite World Series clinchers. Base runners (Lonnie Smith), umpires (Don Denkinger) and even bad hops in Game 7 (1924 and 1960) all helped turn crucial games.         \n\nThe obstruction call that ended Game 3, when Allen Craig tumbled over the legs of third baseman Will Middlebrooks as he tried to score the winning run, stupefied one 79-year-old observer.         \n\n\u201cJust when you think you\u2019ve seen everything, which I like to convince myself that I have \u2014 and everything on and off the field \u2014 no, I never saw this before,\u201d Commissioner Bud Selig said. \u201cNever saw anything close to it.\u201d         \n\nNow we will see something that has not happened in baseball since 1975: the final game of the World Series on Yawkey Way. The sixth game of that series has been rightly celebrated as one of the most spellbinding in baseball history.         \n\nThat is a high standard for any World Series to meet, but this one has been captivating in its own, fractured way.         \n\n\u201cThis is what the postseason is all about,\u201d the Cardinals\u2019 Matt Carpenter said. \u201cBaseball is a game that something you\u2019ve never seen before can happen every day.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/29/sports/baseball/attempt-to-disrupt-hitter-led-to-game-ending-pickoff.html", "date": "2013-10-28", "description": "The Cardinals\u2019 curious roster construction hurt their cause Monday, in a game where there was no need to scroll through World Series past to look for something unprecedented."}
