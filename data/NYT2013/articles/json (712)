{"headline": "Just Neighbors, and Then Much More, for 38 Years", "body": "\n \n         \n\nKent and Jeanne Henriksen grew up across the street from each other in a Los Angeles suburb. They began dating as teenagers and have been married for 38 years. The couple now lives in Pleasant Hill, Ore., where Jeanne is a dental hygienist and Kent a vice president at PeaceHealth Medical Group, a division of PeaceHealth Hospital Organization. They have two adult children. A condensed and edited version of our conversation follows.         \n\n \n         \n\nJeanne: We don\u2019t remember. When I came home from the hospital at 2 days old, my future in-laws were invited over to meet me. He was just always there.         \n\nKent: We were more than neighbors. Her grandparents baby-sat me; my parents baby-sat her. My dad would play ball with her. I went to her birthday parties.         \n\nJeanne: By the time I was in eighth grade and Kent, who\u2019s three years older was in high school, I had the biggest crush. He was interested in the girl next door who was a cheerleader. I would climb up this tree in our yard and watch them. I sat for hours doodling our initials together.         \n\n \n         \n\nKent: One summer Jeanne went away to visit relatives in Alaska and when she came back I thought, \u201cThis little girl across the street is growing up.\u201d She looked so nice and I invited her out. It was our first date.         \n\nJeanne: I was 17 and starting my senior year of high school and he was at U.C. Irvine. After he called I put down the phone and was ready to scream with joy when I realized that his parents would be able to hear me through the screen doors. He had a Chevy Super Sport I was excited to ride in, but picked me up in his dad\u2019s old Ford, which had bench seats. What a player.         \n\n \n         \n\nJeanne: We had such a good time and he dropped me off and drove two hours back to his school. Unbeknown to me he was dating another girl at the university. He would take us out on alternate weekends.         \n\nKent: This is not my proudest moment. The logistics of it just got too crazy. At one point I took them both to events at the Santa Monica Civic Center on consecutive nights; the parking attendant was the same guy both nights and I got nervous. I realized I had to make a choice. I just stopped talking to the other girl. Jeanne was the one that I liked best.         \n\nJeanne: After that we dated exclusively.         \n\n \n         \n\nJeanne: We got married when I was 21, so it was about four years. In the meantime he graduated from U.C. Irvine and I went to Loma Linda University, a private Seventh-day Adventist church school. Kent and his friend Alan had always planned to travel the world when they graduated and in 1975 they actually followed through. He just left with plans to be gone for a year. I cried my eyes out. We didn\u2019t talk about staying together or breaking up. He left and we wrote letters to each other.         \n\nKent: My buddy and I had saved money and headed for South America. I was not being sensitive to her feelings at all. I left her behind to have this adventure, but I wrote all the time. We were gone about three or four months and I just really missed her, so I came back home. I ended up in Florida and took a Greyhound bus from Miami to L.A. because it was $11 cheaper than the direct flight.         \n\nJeanne: He had a little money left, so we talked about taking a trip to Europe, but neither of our parents were thrilled by the idea of us traveling together unmarried. And he turned to me and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just get married?\u201d We did, three weeks later, June 15, 1975.         \n\n \n         \n\nJeanne: I burned them. There was some pretty X-rated stuff in them. After reading some letters his parents had written each other, I thought, \u201cDo I want my kids to read these letters?\u201d I lived for those letters while he was away, but I don\u2019t regret burning them.         \n\n \n         \n\nJeanne: I\u2019ve never regretted one moment with him. Sure, if my life had gone a different way I probably could have been happy with someone else. But why would I go searching for some phantom guy when you have the one you love right there?         \n\nKent: She is the only one. We\u2019re very happy with what we have. I\u2019m also a guy who has liked the same flavor of ice cream for 60 years; I\u2019m not a person who needs lots of adventure.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/19/booming/just-neighbors-and-then-much-more-for-38-years.html", "date": "2013-07-19", "description": "Kent and Jeanne Henriksen started out on the same street, and now can\u2019t imagine life without the other."}
