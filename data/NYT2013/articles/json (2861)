{"headline": "Goodbye, Boston; Hello, Manager of the Year", "body": "\nIn his eight eventful seasons with the  \n, Terry Francona never received a first-place vote for the Manager of the Year award. This was mostly a function of the way voters judge managers, rewarding those perceived to do more with less. The Red Sox always had high payrolls and thus high expectations.         \n\nBut Francona did leave Boston with two championship rings that validated his approach. At least that was the premise a visitor gave Francona in mid-September, before a game at Kansas City. Francona, now the manager of the  \n, would not hear of it.         \n\n\u201cThat was more me being lucky,\u201d he said. \u201cI got put in a position where we had really good teams. I\u2019m not Casey Stengel.\u201d         \n\nThen he cursed, casually, the way so many baseball lifers do; in this case to emphasize his self-deprecation.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m just a normal baseball guy that got put in a really good position,\u201d Francona continued. \u201cAnd I love the players, I love being around them, and I don\u2019t really want to hide the fact that I do. When I have something to tell them, I\u2019m comfortable telling them. I don\u2019t do it through the media. I just tell them how I feel. I just think that\u2019s how it works the best.         \n\n\u201cYou know, everybody\u2019s different, but you\u2019ve got to be true to your own personality. I\u2019m not a big yeller or screamer. I think you can talk to players. I think if you have an atmosphere where guys want to do the right thing, more often than not, you\u2019re going to be O.K.\u201d         \n\nThat is the principal tenet of Francona\u2019s philosophy, which was finally recognized Tuesday by the Baseball Writers\u2019 Association of America. Francona, who helped the Indians improve by 24 games and reach the playoffs for the first time in six years, was named American League manager of the year.         \n\nHe received 15 of the 30 first-place votes, with John Farrell, who led some of Francona\u2019s former players to a World Series title with the Red Sox last month, finishing second.         \n\nFarrell had 12 first-place votes, and Oakland\u2019s Bob Melvin \u2014 last year\u2019s winner \u2014 had two. The Yankees\u2019 Joe Girardi (two second-place votes, five third-place votes) finished fourth, with five other managers behind him.         \n\nVoting was completed before the A.L. playoffs, which began with Francona\u2019s Indians losing the wild-card game at home to Tampa Bay.         \n\n\u201cBetween the front office, ownership and especially the players, this was one of the funnest years I\u2019ve had,\u201d Francona said after the announcement on MLB Network. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get to our end goal, but we\u2019re getting there and we\u2019re having fun doing it.\u201d         \n\nThat was evident in spring training, when Francona led the team in a \u201cHarlem Shake\u201d video, wiggling his rear end to the first beats of the music. He let energetic veterans like Nick Swisher have their fun, using Jason Giambi as a trusted conduit to the clubhouse, and wound up with 92 victories despite few standout performances.         \n\nNo player on the Indians had 25 homers or 85 runs batted in. No everyday player hit .300. No starter worked 200 innings, won 15 games or had an earned run average below 3.00. The pricey free-agent additions, Swisher and Michael Bourn, played below their career norms.         \n\nThe Indians had an $80 million payroll, up from the previous season but still around $68 million less than the Detroit Tigers. Yet they finished just one game behind Detroit in the A.L. Central in Francona\u2019s first year on the job.         \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a fun guy to be around and a player\u2019s coach,\u201d said Jason Kipnis, the Indians\u2019 All-Star second baseman. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t overstep any boundaries, and he lets his players go out and play the games. I think that gives you a feeling of where he\u2019s not in front of you, not talking down to you, not condescending. He\u2019s next to you and fighting with you.\u201d         \n\nFrancona had four losing seasons as manager of the Philadelphia Phillies before landing with the Red Sox for the 2004 season, after the team had lost a crushing A.L. Championship Series to the Yankees. He won championships with Boston in 2004 \u2014 the first for the franchise in 86 years \u2014 and again in 2007.         \n\nAs he was with the Indians, Francona was popular with players for most of his time in Boston. Things fell apart in a mess of dysfunction in 2011, when a sour Red Sox roster staggered to the finish, kicking away a playoff spot and costing Francona his job.         \n\nHe spent a year with ESPN, wrote a memoir and came back revitalized with the Indians, enjoying the kind of trust with the front office that had eroded in Boston.         \n\nThis time, Francona\u2019s team surged when it mattered most. Two years after finishing his Red Sox tenure with a 7-20 record in September, his Indians went 21-6 at the end.
