{"headline": "Naughty or Nice? Not Everyone Is Jolly About SantaCon Coming to Town", "body": "\nNew Yorkers have long endured other people\u2019s celebrations.         \n\nOn St. Patrick\u2019s Day, they know to stay out of the pubs in Midtown if they do not want to be overwhelmed in a sea of semiconscious green.         \n\nThey avoid driving into Manhattan at all costs during the Puerto Rican Day Parade because it turns the heart of the borough into a vast parking lot.         \n\nFashion\u2019s Night Out is an occasion to stay in if you live in SoHo.         \n\nAnd New Year\u2019s Eve? Amateur hour \u2014 unless an out-of-town visitor drags a native kicking and screaming to Times Square.         \n\nNow, a new contender has emerged for the event that many New Yorkers most love to hate:  \n.         \n\nEvery year since 1997, thousands of men and women have dressed up as Santas, elves, reindeer or some other holiday confection and descended on the city\u2019s streets for a daylong bar crawl that begins with good cheer and, for many, inevitably ends in a blurry, booze-soaked haze. Some who come from Long Island and New Jersey get a head start on the festivities on the train ride into the city.         \n\nOn Saturday, the Santas are coming to town again and, judging by the outpouring of vitriol and dread, it would seem that the city was expecting a visit not from St. Nick but from Satan.         \n\nUnlike other holiday gatherings, SantaCon remains shrouded in mystery. There is no official leader, no tickets or sign-in sheets, and the details of the route remain a closely guarded secret until the last possible moment. The rules \u2014 if they can be called that \u2014 are simple: Don\u2019t make children cry, and dress up. This year, the organizers also took to Twitter to remind Santas that unsolicited sexual advances are wrong.         \n\n\u201cDirty ol\u2019 Santa or Ho Ho Ho, just remember No Means No,\u201d they wrote.         \n\nThe post was a recognition by the Santas that they have something of a reputation problem.         \n\nIn the weeks before their arrival on Saturday, signs began popping up on the Lower East Side telling Santas to stay away.         \n\n\u201cAlcohol Soaked Father Christmas-themed flash mob not welcome here,\u201d read one flier. \u201cTake your body fluids and public intoxication elsewhere.\u201d         \n\nJohn Cocchi, a police lieutenant in Hell\u2019s Kitchen, where Santas converged last year, sent an open letter to bar owners urging caution when it came to serving Santas. \u201cHaving thousands of intoxicated partygoers roam the streets urinating, littering, vomiting and vandalizing will not be tolerated in our neighborhood,\u201d he wrote.         \n\nAn Anti-Con movement advocating for SantaCon-free zones has emerged, and the Santas have been pilloried on social media.         \n\nEven the transit authorities are wary. The Long Island Rail Road, Metro-North Railroad and New Jersey Transit announced that no alcohol consumption would be allowed on their trains for 24 hours, starting at noon Saturday.         \n\nOne of the few voices to speak up in favor of the Santas has been, perhaps surprisingly, the police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly. \u201cThis is an event that we support,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what makes New York New York.\u201d         \n\nIn response to all the humbuggery, the anonymous organizers who help coordinate the event broke from their usual policy of not taking questions from the news media. \u201cWe are all very aware of the backlash,\u201d said the man chosen to speak for the group, who agreed to be identified only as Mr. Santa.         \n\nFor the first time, organizers shared the route of the bar crawl with the authorities. There will also be \u201chelper elves\u201d to guide Santas who stumble off the path.         \n\nHe noted that for every bar that does not want Santa to stop by, there are dozens that do. Every establishment on the tour, he said, has pledged to donate a percentage of the day\u2019s profits to Toys for Tots. Last year, the event raised $45,000.         \n\n\u201cWe feel that the city has been turned into a mall,\u201d Mr. Santa explained. \u201cThere is a lot of controlled excitement, but not a lot of loose excitement.\u201d         \n\nSaturday is a chance for people to get loose. \u201cIt is an absurd holiday when you really think about it,\u201d Mr. Santa said. He also defended the drinking.         \n\n\u201cHoliday parties involve drinking spirits,\u201d he said. It is only because this party takes place during the day and people are dressed in costumes that it has attracted so much attention.         \n\nThe public anger probably should not come as a surprise. From the outset, the point was to cause a ruckus.         \n\nThe inspiration for the event is said to have come from a Danish theater group called Solvognen, whose exploits  \n in Mother Jones magazine. In 1974, the group gathered dozens of Santas to storm a department store and hand out items from the shelves to customers as \u201cpresents.\u201d         \n\nAfter reading the article, a group in San Francisco took up the idea and in 1994 organized the first documented SantaCon. It was a relatively small gathering of several dozen and included the fake-lynching of Santa Claus, according to the group\u2019s website,  \n.         \n\nSince then, SantaCon has evolved, taken on a life of its own and  \n. In New York City, the event has grown from several hundred people in the first year to an estimated 30,000 last year.         \n\nThis year, the Santas will converge at 10 a.m. near Tompkins Square Park in the East Village and eventually make their way to Brooklyn, ending near Bedford-Stuyvesant.         \n\nMr. Santa acknowledged that the sight of a Santa vomiting on himself or a Santa passed out on the street does have a memorable \u2014 or infamous \u2014 quality to it.         \n\nBut every Santa must take responsibility for his or her own actions. \u201cNo one controls SantaCon,\u201d he said.
