{"headline": "Leaving Military Aid Intact, U.S. Takes Steps to Halt Economic Help to Egypt", "body": "\nCHILMARK, Mass. \u2014 The Obama administration has taken preliminary steps to withhold financial aid to the Egyptian government, officials said on Sunday, though it is curtailing economic assistance, not the much larger military aid on which  \n\u2019s generals depend.         \n\nThe State Department has put a hold on financing for economic programs that directly involve the Egyptian government, administration officials said, out of a concern that the military-led government might have violated Congressional rules prohibiting aid to countries where there has been a coup.         \n\nThe administration has not declared whether the Egyptian military\u2019s ouster of President Mohamed Morsi constituted a coup. But the State Department is abiding by a complex web of restrictions governing foreign aid, an official said. Those restrictions are tighter than the rules governing the military aid, which has not been suspended.         \n\nWhether to cut off the remaining $585 million in military aid available to Egypt this year was one of the questions that awaited  \n as he returned to Washington from a vacation in Martha\u2019s Vineyard that was shadowed by the bloodshed in Egypt that has left hundreds of Islamist protesters dead.         \n\nFor Egypt, the value of the military aid is perhaps less important than the advanced systems it can buy with American support. Already, the United States is considering a delay in the shipment of Apache attack helicopters and repair kits for tanks. That comes on top of decisions to delay the delivery of four F-16 fighter jets and to pull out of a major joint military exercise next month with the Egyptian Army.         \n\nBut the administration has stopped short of suspending the aid, which has served as a foundation of the American relationship with Egypt for more than three decades and is viewed as critical to the region\u2019s stability, not least as a pillar of the 1979 peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.         \n\nMilitary aid to Egypt dwarfs civilian aid: of the $1.55 billion in total assistance the White House has requested for 2014, $1.3 billion is military and $250 million is economic. The civilian aid goes to such things as training programs and projects run by the United States Agency for International Development.         \n\n\u201cWe have stopped spending money in areas that would be prevented if it were determined to be a coup,\u201d said an administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. \u201cWe\u2019ll put a pause on those programs, because we don\u2019t want to flout the law.\u201d         \n\nAmong the programs affected, the official said, would be training programs in the United States for Egyptian government workers, teachers or hospital administrators. Depending on how events in Egypt unfold, and on how lawmakers react when they return from August recess, the economic aid could resume later, the official said.         \n\nThere are fewer legal restrictions on the $585 million in military aid \u2014 the amount remaining from the original $1.3 billion appropriation. This has yet to be deposited in an account in the Federal Reserve in New York, where the Egyptian military could use it to buy weapons and spare parts and to pay for maintenance and training.         \n\n\"As we\u2019ve made clear, all of our assistance to Egypt is currently under review,\u201d the State Department\u2019s deputy spokeswoman, Marie Harf, said. \u201cAt this point, no additional decisions have been made regarding assistance.\u201d         \n\nIn the past, administration officials have said they were skeptical that halting military aid would persuade the generals to put Egypt back on a path to democracy. They also worry that withdrawing the funds would leave the United States without any leverage.         \n\nIsrael and several Arab counties have lobbied the United States not to cut off aid, arguing that the army is still the best hope to stop Egypt from slipping into chaos and that the need for stability should outweigh, for now, concerns about democracy and human rights.         \n\nBut with the death toll from the week\u2019s violence surpassing 1,000 and little prospect of an end to the standoff, officials said, the administration had begun a debate over what threshold it was willing to bear before it fundamentally rethought its relationship with the military.         \n\nDuring his week on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Mr. Obama tried not to allow the Egypt crisis to intrude on his vacation routine of golf, dinner with friends, and beach and bike outings with his family. But on Thursday, the president held a conference call with members of the National Security Council to discuss options for dealing with the standoff.
