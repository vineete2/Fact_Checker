{"headline": "Poor Decisions Add to Knicks\u2019 Dysfunction", "body": "\nGREENBURGH, N.Y. \u2014 Coach Mike Woodson watched the game film with his players Tuesday, reviewing their many blunders. The foul they opted not to give. The defense they refused to play. The timeout they decided not to take. It was ugly and demoralizing and necessary.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always going to watch tape,\u201d Woodson said, \u201cand I never let anything go unnoticed.\u201d         \n\nNobody has accused the  \n of playing top-notch basketball, but for a team that was already being lampooned for its all-consuming struggles, the final 15 seconds of Monday night\u2019s loss to the  \n provided another round of punch lines, the jokes more robust than ever.         \n\nThe Knicks keep finding new and unusual ways to lose, and as the pressure continues to mount \u2014 on the team in general, and on Woodson in particular \u2014 the danger is that the final possessions of their 102-101 loss have become a defining moment for them, their dysfunction plain to see.         \n\nWhere was the help defense on Bradley Beal\u2019s go-ahead layup with 6.9 seconds remaining? Why did Woodson refuse to call a timeout? Why did Carmelo Anthony slow his dribble to a crawl before he attempted a running 25-footer at the buzzer? Why are the Knicks determined to make things so ridiculously hard on themselves?         \n\n\u201cBad coaching,\u201d Woodson said. \u201cWe made a lot of mistakes coming down the stretch.\u201d         \n\nThe atmosphere is pressurized in New York, of course, where every late-game decision is dissected by a cast of thousands. Woodson has been short-handed. Tyson Chandler could return Wednesday against the Milwaukee Bucks after missing 20 games with a broken right leg. But the Knicks will still be without Pablo Prigioni (toe), Raymond Felton (hamstring), Kenyon Martin (abdominal strain) and Amar\u2019e Stoudemire (knees).         \n\n\u201cGuys are playing hard, and they\u2019re trying,\u201d Mike Dunleavy Sr., a former N.B.A. coach and player, said in a telephone interview. \u201cAll coaches go through this at some point in time. It\u2019s part of the business.\u201d         \n\nBut while Woodson has been able to shield himself after previous losses by citing injuries and poor shooting, the Knicks had ample opportunities to win Monday\u2019s game. It had nothing to do with injuries. It had nothing to do with poor shooting. It had everything to do with questionable decisions.         \n\nAfter the Knicks\u2019 Beno Udrih, who had replaced Prigioni, sank one of two free throws for a 1-point lead with 24 seconds remaining, the Wizards called a timeout. With Iman Shumpert defending John Wall, Wizards Coach Randy Wittman expected that Beal would have an advantage against Udrih, who had labored against him throughout the fourth quarter. So Wittman drew up a play for Beal to use a high screen set by Marcin Gortat.         \n\nThe Knicks had a foul to give, and Woodson said he advised his players to use it, the idea being that the foul would force the Wizards to inbounds the ball again and reset their offense. Beyond that, though, Woodson expected Beal or Wall to come off a screen set by Gortat. Woodson wanted his players to double-team the ball handler and pressure him into passing to Gortat.         \n\nThe Knicks had three timeouts, but Woodson did not address whether to call one in the event the Wizards scored.         \n\n\u201cI think we were banking on getting our stop,\u201d Shumpert said. \u201cWe usually get stops.\u201d         \n\nIt was a liberal use of the word \u201cusually\u201d for a member of a 7-17 team. In any case, Wittman had Wall bring the ball upcourt, more or less as a decoy. With 12 seconds left, Wall handed it off to Beal about 35 feet from the basket. Beal surveyed the scene.         \n\nThe Knicks\u2019 defense did not feature a smorgasbord of lockdown defenders. Andrea Bargnani had been assigned to guard Gortat, and sure enough, Udrih was on Beal. In fairness, Woodson had few options. Martin was sidelined with his injury, and Metta World Peace has been hindered by a bad knee.         \n\nBeal said he knew the screen from Gortat was coming, and he also knew the Knicks would try to get him to give up the ball. So his instinct was to reject the screen and drive baseline if the lane was clear. It was only a matter of seeing what was available to him, he said.
