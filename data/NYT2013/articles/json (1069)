{"headline": "How I Found Love and Companionship Online", "body": "\nI am in my late 50s and should be a better shopper by now. But the word \u201csale\u201d still seduces me and although men are not exactly on sale on Match.com they are, in effect, for sale \n Match.com is ubiquitous with millions of registered singles and although it is easy to weed out the ones with certain politics, geographical areas, and the ones who have been on Match.com for years, I am easily seduced by a reasonable photo and a humorous profile.         \n\nThere are around 700 presumably available men within 50 miles of me, but many cannot use proper grammar or capital letters correctly. Sometimes there are so many errors in their profile paragraphs, I am unable to read them. O.K., I admit it; I am an English teacher, but still ... One man wrote, \u201cnice to meet you, your nice.:)\u201d Even if I ignored the smiley face and the homonym error, how could he say, \u201cwe met?\u201d Some ask questions in their profiles such as \u201cI think people take themselves too seriously, don\u2019t you?\u201d Many men write that they are \u201cworking on\u201d themselves. I was unsure what that meant and had a visual picture of hammers and nails, until a friend suggested that their first marriages ended because they were real jerks, and they are trying to do better.         \n\nI joined Match.com about three months ago, have been on nine first dates, and I am beginning to feel discouraged. My first date was with someone who turned out to be vaguely hostile. We met at an attractive restaurant in Lenox after two weeks of sending witty messages back and forth. Unfortunately, in person he was humorless and disagreeable. He didn\u2019t smile at me even when we shook hands. He said I was out of touch with the country\u2019s politics because I grew up in Boston, which he called \u201ca bastion of elite intellectuals.\u201d I said that I grew up in a working-class section of the city and that neither of my parents had gone to college. He pretended not to hear this. But looking back, I realize there was nothing substantive in the correspondence. We had just ordered drinks and I was thinking that this might be a bad idea since he hadn\u2019t yet smiled at me. At one point I said, \u201cWell, this isn\u2019t working out all that well.\u201d I thought about leaving then, but thought that such outright hostility on my part might be unwise. I didn\u2019t want this guy following me home.         \n\nIt takes about five back-and-forth emails before a meeting is arranged. Then it is best to choose a cafe. If there is a next meeting, then it is usually dinner.         \n\nMost of the time I get discouraged very quickly and wonder why the men look so little like their photos and why in person they lack the pizzazz apparent in their emails.         \n\nThe next worst date was at a cafe in Albany. He was in the restroom when I arrived so I ordered a latte and sat down. We shook hands \u2014his was still wet from the restroom \u2014 and then he went to the counter and came back with a tea and a rather large chocolate cookie wrapped in plastic. He unwrapped half of it and began slowly taking bites. He didn\u2019t offer me any and went on to say how much he hated the Capital District and was planning to leave. He told me he retired at age 55 from the New York City school system and had worked there just to put in the time. I felt sorry for his students. At this point only 10 minutes had passed and I began looking at my watch and thinking of an excuse to get away. I was wondering if there was some way to program my phone to ring, and I could pretend it was my daughter who needed me home. I wondered if he would remember that my daughter was away at college in another state. Still, it would be better than nothing.         \n\nDriving home after a bad date is a complicated experience. I feel relief at getting away, but this is mixed with a bit of anger at myself about the clues I must have missed in our communication. Often I wear disposable contact lenses on the first date and driving home I start calculating how much money I wasted. Aside from the Match.com membership, which is about $30 a month, I figure each date costs me about $27. Never mind the two hours of life I will never get back.         \n\nI was widowed quite unexpectedly three years ago. My husband and I had a long marriage and we were married young enough to grow into our quirks together. People become more of who they are as they age, so what may be a fairly mild quirk at 30 grows into a full-blown neurosis by 55. Trying to date a 60-year-old man is daunting if not impossible.
