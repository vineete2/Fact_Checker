But here in Virginia\u2019s capital, conservative activists are pursuing a hardball campaign as they chart an alternative path to undoing \u201cObamacare\u201d \u2014 through the states.         \n\nOne leading target is Emmett W. Hanger Jr., a Republican state senator from the deeply conservative Shenandoah Valley, who prides himself on \u201cgoing against the grain.\u201d As chairman of a commission weighing one of the thorniest issues in Virginia politics, whether to expand  \n under Mr. Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, he is feeling heat from the Republican right.         \n\nHis openness to expansion has aroused the ire of Americans for Prosperity, the conservative advocacy group backed by the billionaire industrialist brothers Charles and David Koch. Dressed in emerald green T-shirts bearing the slogan \u201cEconomic Freedom in Action!\u201d its members are waging what the senator calls \u201can attempt to intimidate me\u201d in Richmond and at home.         \n\nThey have phoned his constituents, distributed leaflets and knocked on 2,000 doors in his rural district. When the Republican town committee met Monday night in Mr. Hanger\u2019s home county, Augusta, Americans for Prosperity was there.         \n\nIn Richmond on Tuesday, hundreds of volunteers in green shirts turned out for a commission hearing, bused in by the advocacy group\u2019s field organizers, who provided Subway sandwiches for lunch.         \n\n\u201cThis has been one of those trench warfare kind of efforts for a year now, and I think it is one of those hidden stories of the whole fight against Obamacare,\u201d said Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity. \u201cIt\u2019s not flashy; it\u2019s just in a whole bunch of state capitals and in the districts of a whole lot of state legislators, but it\u2019s such a crucial aspect of the overall long-term effort to roll back Obamacare.\u201d         \n\nThe state-by-state strategy represents a split from the course pursued by Heritage Action for America and its sister organization, Heritage Foundation, which drove the \u201cdefunding Obamacare\u201d movement that led to the recent government shutdown. In  \n published Friday by The Wall Street Journal, Jim DeMint, the foundation president, made no apologies. \u201cObamacare will now be the issue for the next few years,\u201d he wrote.         \n\nExpanding Medicaid, a joint federal-state program for the poor, is critical to the law\u2019s goal of covering the nation\u2019s 48 million uninsured. Hospitals and insurers were also counting on more Medicaid patients to make the economics of the law work. For states, the terms seemed attractive: The federal government would pay 100 percent of the cost of new enrollees for the first three years, 90 percent after that.         \n\nBut in June 2012, the Supreme Court ruled that states could opt out of Medicaid expansion. The ruling opened the door for conservative opponents of the law. Americans for Prosperity, with paid staff members in 34 states, walked through it. So did another group, Tea Party Patriots, which recently gave $20,000 to organizers of a referendum drive to put the question of Medicaid expansion on the Arizona ballot.         \n\nAmericans for Prosperity has spent millions in states around the country, including Arkansas, Florida, Ohio, Louisiana, Michigan and Pennsylvania, to run the kind of aggressive campaign that it is now waging here in Virginia, where much will depend on the governor\u2019s race. The Democratic candidate, Terry McAuliffe, who leads in the polls, favors expansion. The Republican candidate, Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, is opposed.         \n\nSo far roughly half the states are moving forward with Medicaid expansion, and an increasing number of Republican governors are expressing interest. Michigan, where Gov. Rick Snyder recently signed Medicaid expansion legislation into law, was \u201ca tough loss,\u201d Mr. Phillips conceded. In Ohio, Gov. John R. Kasich wants to expand. So does Gov. Tom Corbett in Pennsylvania, even though the legislature has already rejected it.         \n\n\u201cThis is going to be an issue all through 2014 for us,\u201d said Jennifer Stefano, a former television reporter who runs Americans for Prosperity\u2019s Pennsylvania chapter. \u201cI don\u2019t believe this fight is in Washington or ever was. I think this is a street fight. It\u2019s a man to man, so to speak, fight of going door to door.\u201d         \n\nThat, at least, is the way the battle is being waged here in Virginia, where Mr. Hanger, a 30-year veteran of state politics, is navigating politically treacherous waters.         \n\nHis panel, formed after the State House and Senate could not agree, must evaluate whether the state Medicaid program has put in place certain changes to improve care and cut costs. It has five members from each chamber; the program can be expanded only if three from each chamber agree. So far, four House members are opposed.         \n\nMr. Hanger said he had not made up his mind, but added, \u201cIt makes absolutely no sense to not utilize those federal dollars when we have this unmet need.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/19/us/politics/states-are-focus-of-effort-to-foil-health-care-law.html", "date": "2013-10-18", "description": "Conservative groups are increasingly taking the fight against President Obama\u2019s health care law to states like Virginia in an effort to block Medicaid expansion."}
