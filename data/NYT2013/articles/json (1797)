It was Mr. Gilligan\u2019s, whose show made its debut in 2008 and had been nominated for the top drama prize three times since, but had never won. Mr. Gilligan did not mention the impending finale next Sunday, but he did not have to \u2014 the award was a free advertisement before an anticipated audience of at least 10 million viewers.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m just so happy for Vince,\u201d AMC\u2019s president, Charlie Collier, said as he exited the Nokia Theater.         \n\nUntil Mr. Gilligan\u2019s acceptance speech at the very end of the Emmys on Sunday, it looked as if \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d might come away almost empty-handed.         \n\nThere were audible gasps of \u201cWhoa!\u201d and \u201cWhat?\u201d in the auditorium here as Jeff Daniels of HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Newsroom\u201d won the annual outstanding actor in a drama award, besting Mr. Cranston, who had won three times before and was widely expected to win again. Mr. Daniels sounded as surprised as anyone when he accepted the award; he had not expected to win.         \n\nNeither had Bobby Cannavale, of HBO\u2019s \u201cBoardwalk Empire;\u201d in fact he had not even written an acceptance speech. But he beat two \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d actors, Aaron Paul and Jonathan Banks, in the supporting actor category. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I get to get mentioned with these other really incredible actors,\u201d Mr. Cannavale said.         \n\nBut \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d did pick up one acting award, for Anna Gunn, who plays Walter White\u2019s wife, Skyler, and was recognized as best supporting actress. (\u201cBryan Cranston just told me to breathe,\u201d she said as she came on stage.)         \n\nTo the surprise of many Emmy observers, the two stars of \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright, came away without awards. The filmmaker David Fincher, who directed the first episode of \u201cCards,\u201d won an Emmy for best directing, but he was not there to accept it. (A Netflix spokesman said he was filming \u201cGone Girl.\u201d)         \n\nBut the wins for \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d might be seen indirectly as wins for Netflix, too: five prior seasons of the AMC series are available on the streaming service. Minutes after \u201cBad\u201d won the best drama award, the widely followed Netflix Twitter account congratulated the show \u2014 \u201cAll hail (this year\u2019s) king\u201d \u2014 and reminded subscribers that they could catch up online.         \n\nEarlier in the evening, Showtime\u2019s \u201cHomeland,\u201d which last year took home the Emmy for outstanding drama and was nominated again this year, won two awards, one for the actress Claire Danes and another for Henry Bromell, a writer on the series who died of a heart attack in March. Mr. Bromell\u2019s widow, Sarah, accepted his award. Ms. Danes, accepting her award later, paused to acknowledge Mr. Bromell. \u201cWe think of him every day as we continue to work on the show that he helped define,\u201d she said.         \n\nIt was a night of upsets \u2014 with all-too-numerous remembrances of stars who had passed away in the past year \u2014 from the very first award, when Merritt Wever won for her supporting actress performance on Showtime\u2019s \u201cNurse Jackie,\u201d beating the three-time winner Julie Bowen of \u201cModern Family\u201d as well as Ms. Bowen\u2019s co-star, Sofia Vergara.
