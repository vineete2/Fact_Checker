{"headline": "Writing Bytes", "body": "\n \n         \n\n \n Do new technologies change what plot devices are available for writers of fiction? Do chickens have beaks? (Once, the answer to the chicken question would have been self-evident, but novel food-producing practices must now give us pause. To search online: De-beaking. Lab meat.)         \n\nBut back to the query. The answer is, of course. So it has always been. How to move a character from here to there? (Horse. Boat. Coach. Dogcart, as in Sherlock Holmes. Train. Streetcar. Automobile. Plane.) How to eliminate a character in a violent or murderous fashion? (Rock. Club. Knife. Sword. Own petard. Gun. Fooling with their GPS so they drive into the sea.) How to have them communicate? (Smoke signals. Drums. Cuneiform. Scroll. Postal Service. Telegram. Phone. Hole in a tree, if a John le Carr\u00e9 spy. E-mail. Writing on your hand so the mini-drones can\u2019t see or hear it.)         \n\nEach of these technologies has its downsides and loopholes, which can be turned against one character by another. Each has its moment of obsolescence, which in fiction marks the plausibility threshold. Could a landline telephone still ring as suspensefully as it did in \u201cDial M for Murder\u201d? Not likely. A cellphone playing an annoying bar from the \u201cWilliam Tell\u201d Overture, plaintively, under a shrub, is more like it.         \n\nYour practice test: Rewrite Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s story \u201cThe Purloined Letter,\u201d using present-day communications technology. In the original, a \u201cletter,\u201d made of \u201cpaper,\u201d written in \u201cink,\u201d and bearing a \u201cseal,\u201d was disguised as an inferior letter and hidden in plain view. The letter needed to be invisible to searchers, but close at hand so it could be quickly produced when needed.         \n\nGo to it. I\u2019m sure there are a hundred brilliant solutions to the puzzle of \u201cThe Purloined E-Mail.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\n \n I entered college in 1993 and graduated in 1997. Halfway through, the Internet became a thing. Netscape said: \u201cHere you go, here\u2019s a door to a brand-new place in the existence of the universe. We just started letting people in. Go ahead, it\u2019s fun. It\u2019ll keep getting bigger for the rest of your life. Also, you can change stuff in it. You get to make up new rules for everything \u2014 thinking, remembering, communicating.\u201d         \n\nThis new place needs to be studied; it needs geographers, anthropologists and economists. There\u2019s a new visual and conceptual grammar \u2014 just as we learned how to look at paintings, so too have we developed ways of looking and being in cyberspace.         \n\nWe\u2019re trying to understand a metaphor that exploded into the world, one that we inhabit. That\u2019s what we\u2019re grappling with. We\u2019re trying to draw maps of uncharted invisible territories. Put that way \u2014 as a cartography of psychological terrain \u2014 it sounds like a familiar exercise, like a decent definition of what it means to be a fiction writer. Reality, it turns out, is its own genre-bending story. And writing fiction has become complicated, since reality has already written the best possible science fiction story imaginable.         \n\nOn the other hand, I woke up one day in 1995, and there was this whole new place. And I get to watch this implausible story unfold. So there\u2019s that.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n The trouble with technology is that it eradicates a character\u2019s ability to be lost, and it\u2019s the state of being in the dark and the journey toward understanding that has given rise to the greatest stories ever written. Marlow\u2019s voyage up the uncharted Congo in \u201cHeart of Darkness,\u201d the shocking truth of Rochester\u2019s past in \u201cJane Eyre,\u201d the mysterious gentleman caller in \u201cThe Glass Menagerie\u201d \u2014 none of these tales could take place today because access to a smartphone would reveal mysterious whereabouts, mad first wives and marital status in seconds without the hero ever needing to leave his living room couch. And without a character forced to seek answers in the real world there can be no journey, no transformation.
