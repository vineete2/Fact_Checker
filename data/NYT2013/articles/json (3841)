{"headline": "Love Canal and Its Mixed Legacy", "body": "\n \n         \n\nThe 1970s began with a remarkable pulse of federal legislation aimed at protecting  \n and restoring the nation\u2019s  \n and  \n. But it took until 1978 for another type of environmental threat, toxic hot spots left behind by industrial activity, to gain the spotlight.         \n\nThe galvanizing story was that of the frightened, outraged homeowners around Love Canal, an  \n in upstate New York that, in the industrial boom around World War II, became a chemical dump. Covered with dirt, the 16-acre site in 1953 was sold under pressure by the Hooker Chemical Company to the local school district for a dollar, with the paperwork  \n.         \n\nNonetheless, a school was built. Suburbia encroached. Then 35 years ago, the site\u2019s buried and largely forgotten history  \n as contaminants seeped into some nearby homes and residents complained of illness, miscarriages and other effects.         \n\n \n, a mother of two who led community efforts to get nearby families relocated and seek compensation from the responsible company, became the public face of Love Canal and  \n devoted to cleaning up such sites.         \n\nThe state and federal governments declared an environmental emergency, eventually moving 239 families out of the neighborhood and, in 1980, buying 500 more homes from families seeking to leave the area.         \n\nIn December of that year, the most sweeping impact of Love Canal came with enactment of the  \n, best known as Superfund. That law has had a long and contentious history since, with its cost  \n.         \n\nThis Retro Report video casts that mixed legacy this way: \u201cWhile sometimes criticized as costly and bureaucratic, Superfund has led to the remediation of nearly 400 toxic sites. Love Canal was among the first addressed. But it took nearly two decades and cost more than $350 million.\u201d (In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency says  \n more than 700 other that still remain on the Superfund list.)         \n\nThe legal and medical issues at Love Canal are still playing out.         \n\nOccidental Petroleum, which ended up with responsibility for the toxic site,  \n in 1983,  \n and  \n.         \n\nBut now some families who bought homes nearby after the cleanup have gone to court, claiming harm from seeping pollutants. \u201cNew residents, attracted by promises of cleaned-up land and affordable homes, say in lawsuits that they are being sickened by the same buried chemicals from the disaster in the Niagara Falls neighborhood in the 1970s,\u201d the  \n this month. In the article, E.P.A. officials insist that the cleanup and containment of the pollution succeeded.         \n\nA central question, for residents old and new, is whether the passage of time has bolstered or undermined initial health concerns related to the more than 80 chemicals buried at the site, including 11 that state officials at the time said were carcinogens.         \n\nAn initial burst of government and independent epidemiological investigations led to confused and sometimes contradictory results, with some finding significant health impacts but others seeing no pattern distinguishing the health of people who had lived there from residents of unaffected communities around Niagara County or New York State.         \n\nA  \n found some evidence of raised rates of birth defects but found that the overall cancer rate for residents was no different than that in the surrounding population.         \n\nA persistent challenge in such studies is that ailments of greatest concern, like cancers, are rare enough that it is often impossible to detect a statistically significant indication of cause and effect amid the many other factors, like smoking, that can play a role. Another issue is that many cancers take decades to unfold.         \n\n \n, a longtime Newsday medical and environmental writer who wrote a recent extraordinary book on toxic sites and cancer, \u201c \n,\u201d noted in an email exchange that Love Canal had too many unknowns about exposure routes and doses and too few highly exposed people to settle questions of environmentally induced disease.         \n\n\u201cLike so much else in this fraught corner of science, Love Canal is a Rorschach test in which people see what they wish to see,\u201d he wrote.         \n\n\u201cBelievers see a manmade public health disaster linked through credible epidemiology to a range of health problems, especially developmental issues in children born of exposed mothers. They\u2019re right. Skeptics see a case of fear run amok amid initially overblown scientific claims, especially of high cancer rates and significant genetic damage, neither of which have held up very well under scrutiny. They\u2019re right, too.\u201d         \n\nCampaigners who raised the alarm emphasize Love Canal as a symbol of the power of communities to defend themselves against corporate villainy. For more, read  \n, the Center for Health, Environment and Justice, or this New York Times  \n.         \n\nMeanwhile, for industry, it has become  \n showing how data \u2014 the lack of evidence of substantial health impacts around the waste site \u2014 don\u2019t always, or even often, rule the day when industrial pollution hits the news. A detailed history of the environmental campaign around Love Canal  \n by the Boston University School of Public Health.         \n\nThe uncertainties do not diminish Love Canal\u2019s place in history, Mr. Fagin said.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Love Canal ever cracked the top 100 of the E.P.A.'s National Priorities List \u2014 there were (and still are) many sites where more people faced higher risks,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut America is still talking about Love Canal after more than 35 years because it was the first toxic waste site that was a truly national story, a testament to the relentlessness and organizing skills of Lois Gibbs and the Love Canal Homeowners Association, and to the importance of their legislative legacy, Superfund.\u201d         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/25/booming/love-canal-and-its-mixed-legacy.html", "date": "2013-11-25", "description": "The environmental scandal in upstate New York that led to the creation of the Superfund law is still causing dismay for local residents."}
