{"headline": "The Fearless, Risk-Loving Winemaker", "body": "\nSomewhere in the manicured farmlands of Napa Valley, a 52-year-old winemaker named Abe Schoener stood in a puny and weed-choked tract of land surrounded by 40 gray and contorted barren vines, which he surveyed with paternal satisfaction. \u201cMy view when I started leasing this was, It\u2019s 60-year-old-vine sauvignon blanc,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cHow bad could it be?\u201d         \n\nNo other winemaker had been willing to find out. Though it\u2019s believed that these could be the oldest sauvignon blanc vines in all of California, their average annual yield \u2014 about 30 gallons of wine, or 14 cases \u2014 is so paltry that investing in this scruffy vineyard, which is owned by the McDowell family, who threaten every year to uproot the vines and replace them with cabernet sauvignon, would hardly seem worth the effort.         \n\nSchoener (pronounced  \n) views this matter, and almost everything else, differently. The most frequently used word in his extensive vocabulary is \u201cinteresting\u201d \u2014 as in, \u201cI find it interesting that I have absolutely no desire to own my own winery\u201d \u2014 and his days seem to be consumed by the desire to evade predictability. \u201cNo one else would want to work in this vineyard, because it\u2019s a pain in the ass, but it\u2019s perfect for Scholium,\u201d he said, referring to his one-man winery, the Scholium Project. For the past eight years, Scholium has made sauvignon blanc from the McDowell property, though the wine\u2019s label makes no mention of the actual grape, much less the oldness of its vines. Instead, the bottle simply reads, \u201cGlos,\u201d a reference to the name of the street that the vineyard is on, as well as the Greek word \u201c \n,\u201d which translates to \u201cword\u201d or \u201clanguage.\u201d (In a previous life, Schoener taught classics at St. John\u2019s College in Annapolis, Md.) Standing beside him on the McDowell property were three of his interns, all of whom have pruned and harvested the vines: Alex, a former chef at the French Laundry; Brenna, a comprehensively tattooed wine director; and Courtney, a wine journalist who, when I asked her what the wine from this vineyard tasted like, sternly informed me, \u201cIt tastes like Glos.\u201d (Later I paid $45 for a bottle, which is pale and restrained and unlike any other sauvignon blanc I\u2019ve encountered. I guess that means it tastes like Glos.)         \n\nAfter showing me the McDowell Vineyard, Schoener drove us a few miles south to another vineyard he leases. We pulled up to the residence of a former refrigerator repairman named John Guman, who does not drink wine or any other kind of alcohol. After parking in the driveway and strolling past a collection of rusted tractors, we arrived in Guman\u2019s backyard. There sprawled an oversize garden of 30-year-old chardonnay vines. \u201cThis is an A-plus vineyard,\u201d Schoener announced. \u201cHere is a place where one can make ageless wines. All you have to do is not screw it up.\u201d         \n\nBut it was also ridiculously miniature, producing in some vintages only about 80 gallons of juice, not much more than the McDowell property. For that very reason, the venerable Pahlmeyer winery stopped buying grapes from the Guman site after 2001. Schoener pounced on it. He calls the end product the Sylphs, after a mythological creature. As with Glos, its accompanying label says nothing about chardonnay, which is just as well, given that it doesn\u2019t really taste like chardonnay. Schoener has likened its flavor to porcini mushrooms and crushed rocks. At around $80 a bottle (of which there are sometimes as few as a hundred in a given vintage), the Sylphs sells out every year.         \n\nWhile Schoener squinted reverently at the chardonnay vines, Brenna trained adoring eyes on him. She confessed to me, in Schoener\u2019s presence, that the experience of working in his winery created \u201ca feeling that is almost reminiscent of being in love.\u201d I had seen similar displays of devotion at wine tastings that Schoener held in Brooklyn and San Francisco attended by well-heeled consumers who, while listening to the winemaker hold forth and sampling his unorthodox wines, buzzed among themselves like discoverers of a latter-day Dylan. Though there may be more coveted cult wines than those of the Scholium Project, the charismatic and somewhat quixotic Schoener is possibly America\u2019s only winemaker with a cult following of his own.         \n\n \n, Schoener owes his success to the burgeoning market for culinary adventurism. As his friend and fellow small-scale Napa winemaker Steve Matthiasson told me, \u201cThe millennial generation are getting into position as wine buyers, and just like they\u2019re into the local-food movement and choosing between Berkshire pork and Mangalitsa pork, they\u2019re also culturally interested in exploring differences in wine.\u201d But Schoener has tapped into a longing that extends beyond an appreciation of flavors and origins. True, his strange, often wonderful wines express the seasonal eccentricities of both the vineyard and the maker rather than a striving for uniform taste and high Wine Spectator ratings. More broadly, however, Schoener is selling the experience of extreme authenticity, of something pure and irreplicable. The arrangement is almost absurdly harmonious: the classics professor who has gone to the land (not just any land, but land that\u2019s forgotten and seemingly irredeemable) and found virtue there, for himself and ultimately for his customers, who by buying his wines are buying into Schoener\u2019s vision and thereby becoming something more than just elitist wine collectors. As Javier Martell, a San Francisco-based lawyer and one of Schoener\u2019s longtime customers, told me: \u201cPart of the attraction of his wines is for people like me who practice law for a living and have a forced rigidity in our lives. Abe\u2019s wines give us an escape \u2014 I\u2019m going with the flow, and Abe\u2019s leading me down it, and it\u2019s sort of liberating.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/07/magazine/the-fearless-risk-loving-winemaker.html", "date": "2013-04-04", "description": "Abe Schoener\u2019s quest to thrill, infuriate and baffle oenophiles."}
