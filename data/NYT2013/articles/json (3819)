{"headline": "Roy Choi, L.A.\u2019s Street-Food King", "body": "\nThe Los Angeles chef and restaurateur Roy Choi was once a gambler and nearly a gangster, and a stoner from youth who was quick to fight, slow to wake. Born in Korea in 1970, he came to California two years later and grew up amid the dangerous currents of immigrant possibility: at his parents\u2019 liquor store in Koreatown, until it failed; at his parents\u2019 restaurant in West Anaheim, until it failed; at his parents\u2019 jewelry store in Orange County, which made his family rich.         \n\nHe was surrounded by latchkey knuckleheads, smart kids with bad attitudes, Armenian gem dealers, drug connects, college students, dishwashers, too many card players. It was a chef\u2019s education \u2014 hardly obvious at the time \u2014 because even as he gambled, fought and schemed, he ate, voraciously, from every larder in town. Nothing fancy. Quite the opposite: his parents\u2019 hot pots; dinners of ketchup-fried rice and Del Taco takeout; pho and cheeseburgers; kimchi and milkshakes at dawn. It was a life of late nights.         \n\nOnly a moment of clarity on a friend\u2019s couch watching Emeril Lagasse on television when he was 26 saved him, Choi writes in his compelling new memoir and cookbook, \u201cL.A. Son.\u201d He was half drunk and high before noon again, filled with the usual self-hatred and self-pity, staring listlessly at this New Orleans chef with a New England accent cooking French food. Then bam! His future appeared as Emeril talked, it seemed, directly to him. Cooking would be his life.         \n\n\u201cI saw myself in the kitchen,\u201d Choi writes, with some amazement. \u201cI saw myself at home.\u201d He got up off the couch. A stint at the Culinary Institute of America followed, then a long run in hotel kitchens, followed by Kogi, the food truck that would bring him fame as the progenitor of the Korean-Mexican taco and a street king of Los Angeles cooking.         \n\nChoi, 43, describes his personal history in colorful language that owes some to Jack Kerouac, a little to Anthony Bourdain, who published \u201cL.A. Son\u201d under his imprint for Ecco, and plenty to the rhythm and swagger of early \u201990s West Coast hip-hop. (It is expletive-heavy, and largely unquotable here.)         \n\nThe recipes that accompany the stories are fascinating. They are not the dishes for which Choi is known \u2014 the tacos that first brought him triumph, or the beer-can chicken he serves at A-Frame, his restaurant on the city\u2019s west side. Instead, they look back to what he cooked and what he ate in the years that led up to his success, to the varied and oftentimes unheralded food of Los Angeles itself.         \n\nAnd so here is instant ramen flavored with slices of American cheese, immediately recognizable to Koreans across their diaspora (and pretty great). Here is chili spaghetti, and kung pao chicken, carne asada, pork and beans, soybean-paste stew, even the potatoes Anna he cooked as a hotel chef \u2014 all the flavors of his family and the late-night and corporate experiences concentrated into something approaching a cuisine.         \n\n\u201cPeople want to know where my cooking comes from,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to tell them, and this seemed the best, most honest way.\u201d         \n\nChoi\u2019s mother\u2019s cooking hovers over all of \u201cL.A. Son\u201d and provides our menu here: the  \n  \n, a staple of potlucks and church suppers, or in Choi\u2019s words, \u201cthat meal from home that every Korean kid says his or her mom does best.\u201d         \n\nHis (hers) is rich and deeply flavored, thickly sauced and pungent with sugar and spice amid a thrum of soy and garlic. It is the sort of meal you could put together after lunch on a Sunday and allow to simmer away for much of the afternoon, then serve for dinner to accolades, or make on a Saturday, store overnight in the refrigerator and achieve the same result. A Friday-night braise leads to an incredible Monday night dinner. It is the best sort of family food.         \n\nBefore cooking, Choi\u2019s mother soaks her short ribs in water overnight to release their impurities. \u201cIt was almost as if she was soaking along with the meat,\u201d Choi told me about watching her cook the dish. \u201cShe traveled along with the process, right along with the meat.\u201d (I tried this method. I felt I got a similar result, minus the spiritual uplift, just rinsing the ribs a number of times before I got down to braise.)         \n\nThe dish is simple to prepare. You make the braising liquid by pur\u00e9eing scallions, ginger, onions and garlic with a combination of soy sauce, mirin and orange and apple juices. You simmer the ribs in the mixture for a few hours, then add shiitakes, chestnuts, taro, carrots and butternut squash, and allow the whole thing to come together into a crazy-delicious whole. Serve with rice.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to prove  \n with these recipes,\u201d Choi said. \u201cI just want people to cook.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/magazine/roy-choi-las-street-food-king.html", "date": "2013-10-30", "description": "With his first book, \u201cL.A.
