{"headline": "A Question of How Women\u2019s Issues Will Fare, in Washington and Overseas", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Catherine M. Russell\u2019s portfolio includes half the population of the planet, roughly 3.5 billion women. But working with the 70,000 employees of the State Department to make women\u2019s issues a permanent priority, she said, may be the \u201charder slog\u201d in a difficult new job.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that most people in the building I think are very receptive to, but it\u2019s a long process,\u201d Ms. Russell said in a recent interview in a coffee shop in downtown Washington.         \n\nMs. Russell\u2019s position, ambassador at large for global women\u2019s issues, was created by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2009 to elevate one of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s longtime causes.         \n\nBut Ms. Russell\u2019s new boss, Secretary of State John Kerry, is primarily focused on forging Middle East peace, not women\u2019s issues. The question at the State Department, and among Mrs. Clinton\u2019s friends, is whether the ambassador at large and women\u2019s issues over all will get the attention they once did.         \n\nSo far the White House says yes. Ms. Russell was a close aide to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. when he was in the Senate, and most recently she was chief of staff to Mr. Biden\u2019s wife, Jill. She is married to Tom Donilon, a former national security adviser to President Obama, who  \n in June.         \n\n\u201cShe\u2019s extremely well connected, in a quiet way,\u201d Mr. Biden said in a telephone interview. Ms. Russell is empowered, he said, by \u201ctwo important things: John Kerry and me.\u201d He quickly added, \u201cAnd the president.\u201d         \n\nStill, Ms. Russell\u2019s White House connections will be tested in a field where success is hard to define and the goals are often amorphous. In a speech in April, Mrs. Clinton said in a typical formulation that she had created the job to weave the perspective of women\u2019s issues \u201cinto the fabric of American foreign policy.\u201d         \n\nMrs. Clinton chose as the first women\u2019s ambassador her close friend Melanne Verveer, who was her chief of staff as first lady. In Ms. Verveer\u2019s subsequent travels to more than 60 countries \u2014 where she often said that \u201cno country can get ahead if it leaves half its population behind\u201d \u2014 leaders always knew she was channeling one of the world\u2019s most famous women.         \n\nMs. Russell does not have that advantage, but said she was determined to carry on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s work. Her mission, she said, is to build on the efforts of the  \n \u2014 with its staff of 24 and budget last year of $3.4 million \u2014 to \u201cput in place the structure and the mechanisms to keep moving this effort forward long after all of us are gone.\u201d         \n\nOfficials in the office cite as accomplishments their push to ensure that 300 women took part in nationwide peace talks in Afghanistan in 2010 and their insistence that women\u2019s advancement be codified in the strategic partnership agreement that set forth the relationship between the United States and Afghanistan after 2014.         \n\nThe office also counts as success stories a $17 million effort in 2009 to crack down on sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo \u2014 including training for police officers and judges, and health care and jobs courses for survivors \u2014 and an extensive public-private partnership in the Americas that provides female entrepreneurs better access to markets and credit.         \n\n\u201cInvesting in women, advancing and protecting their rights, is not just the right thing to do morally,\u201d Ms. Russell said during her confirmation hearing in July. \u201cIt is the smart thing to do economically and strategically.\u201d         \n\nBut in the interview, her first since her confirmation as ambassador, Ms. Russell seemed less at ease discussing her new global terrain and more comfortable talking, at length, about the federal bureaucracy she lives and breathes in Washington. She joked that she would have advised Mrs. Biden against giving that kind of long-winded answers. At 52 and the mother of two teenagers, she said she had recovered fully from a minor stroke she suffered last December.         \n\nMs. Russell has not always made women\u2019s issues a professional focus. But they have \u201cbeen the center of her life and her interests,\u201d Mrs. Biden said in an interview.         \n\nIn Reading, Pa., Ms. Russell\u2019s parents raised five children \u2014 she was the oldest \u2014 and ran a small plastics business. She studied philosophy at Boston College before earning a law degree at George Washington University. Ms. Russell first met Mr. Donilon when they worked on Walter F. Mondale\u2019s presidential campaign in 1984. They married in 1991.
