The Tile House, its local nickname, is an eccentric, Moorish-looking brick folly on the south shore of Long Island, built by Rafael Guastavino Jr., the son of the architect Rafael Guastavino Sr., who developed the tile-vaulting system used in the Oyster Bar, the Whispering Gallery and in hundreds of other spaces, including Carnegie Hall and the Cathedral of St. John the Divine.         \n\nBegun in 1912, when the younger Guastavino was working on Grand Central, the house is a riot of tile work: his own instantly recognizable herringbone arches, supplemented with European tiles he brought back from a honeymoon tour. When he died in 1950, he left the place to his daughter, Louise, who sold it eight years later (she died in 2004). By 2005, it was for sale, and on the Preservation League of New York State\u2019s \u201cSeven to Save\u201d list. A couple from Florida who are in the business of buying and restoring old houses bought it then, saving it from a developer who wanted to tear it down. Their renovations included removing the decades-old trees that were growing in a garage.         \n\nBy 2010 it was on the market again, and Mr. McDonald\u2019s stepdaughter, Abigail Mann, saw it listed for sale.         \n\n\u201cI was worried it was going to be a little too much like Grand Central station,\u201d said Mr. McDonald, who in a neat twist of fate bought the house for $1.2 million that December, saving it from the wrecking ball.         \n\nOne bright Monday, he and Ms. Karr-McDonald sat in the tiled sunroom, reminiscing about how they met, and how Mr. McDonald, who was living in a single-room-occupancy hotel at the time, came to be a homeowner and family man.         \n\n\u201cHe was penniless,\u201d Ms. Karr-McDonald said.         \n\nMr. McDonald broke in: \u201cI showed her the room and told her, \u2018This is it.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nHusky-voiced and clad in a bright red mini-dress \u2014 a nod, perhaps, to her glamorous past (she was once married to  \n, the screenwriter) or to her upbringing as the child of activists, \u201ca red-diaper baby,\u201d as her husband said proudly \u2014 Ms. Karr-McDonald recalled her week with Ms. Savino, the young runaway who later shot herself in the face when she was unable to sell a gun she had stolen. When Mr. McDonald delivered the eulogy at the Church of St. Agnes on 43rd Street, she assumed he was the minister.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m Jewish, so what did I know?\u201d Ms. Karr-McDonald said. \u201cHe gives this amazing eulogy about how April is a shining star in the night sky. Outside on the steps, I say in typical Hollywood style, \u2018I own the rights to her life.\u2019 He says, \u2018Right, but she\u2019s dead\u2019 and asks me for a drink. We go to the Lion\u2019s Head and he\u2019s rubbing my leg and I\u2019m thinking, \u2018Everything you hear about priests must be true.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nMr. McDonald said, \u201cAfter we adjusted who we were, I knew I had her when I put her in a cab and she looked back at me out of the window.\u201d         \n\nLater, he read her script, which never did get made. By the time he had finished it, he said, he knew he would marry her. \u201cIt was a view into her soul, and she had captured what I knew was there in Grand Central station.\u201d         \n\nWith the help of her parents, who moved in with them, Mr. McDonald and Ms. Karr-McDonald bought a house on East 84th Street. (Coincidentally, they bought it from  \n, the chief executive of Gristedes, now also running for mayor, who gave Mr. McDonald two mortgages. As Mr. McDonald said, \u201cThis is an only-in-New York story.\u201d)        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/25/garden/a-mayoral-candidate-reflects-on-the-mosaic-of-his-life.html", "date": "2013-07-24", "description": "Grand Central Terminal has been a touchstone of sorts throughout George McDonald\u2019s life.
