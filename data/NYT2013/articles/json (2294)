{"headline": "He Has Millions and a New Job at Yahoo. Soon, He\u2019ll Be 18.", "body": "\nOne of  \n\u2019s newest employees is a 17-year-old high school student in Britain. As of Monday, he is one of its richest, too.         \n\nThat student, Nick D\u2019Aloisio, a programming whiz who wasn\u2019t even born when Yahoo was founded in 1994, sold his news-reading app, Summly, to the company on Monday for a sum said to be in the tens of millions of dollars. Yahoo said it would incorporate his algorithmic invention, which takes long-form stories and shortens them for readers using smartphones, in its own mobile apps, with Mr. D\u2019Aloisio\u2019s help.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve still got a year and a half left at my high school,\u201d he said in a telephone interview on Monday. But he will make arrangements to test out of his classes and work from the Yahoo office in London, partly to abide by the company\u2019s new and much-debated policy that prohibits working from home.         \n\nMr. D\u2019Aloisio, who declined to comment on the price paid by Yahoo (the technology news site AllThingsD  \n at about $30 million), was Summly\u2019s largest shareholder.         \n\nSummly\u2019s other investors, improbably enough, included Wendi Murdoch, Ashton Kutcher and Yoko Ono. The most important one was Li Ka-shing, the Hong Kong billionaire, whose investment fund supported Mr. D\u2019Aloisio\u2019s idea early on, before it was even called Summly.         \n\n\u201cThey took a gamble on me when I was a 15-year-old,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Aloisio said, by providing seed financing that let him hire employees and lease office space.         \n\nThe fund read about Mr. D\u2019Aloisio\u2019s early-stage app on TechCrunch, the Silicon Valley blog of record, found his e-mail address and startled him with a message expressing interest.         \n\nThe others signed up later. \u201cBecause it was my first time around, people just wanted to help,\u201d he said.         \n\nFor teenagers who fancy themselves entrepreneurs \u2014 and their parents, too \u2014 the news of the sale conjured up some feelings of inadequacy, but also awe. For Brian Wong, the 21-year-old founder of Kiip, a mobile rewards company, the reaction was downright laughable: \u201cI feel old!\u201d         \n\nA few years ago, Mr. Wong was described in the news media as the youngest person ever to receive venture capital funding. But a couple of younger founders came along \u2014 \u201cand then Nick broke all of our records,\u201d Mr. Wong said on Monday.         \n\nAmong the attributes that helped Mr. D\u2019Aloisio, he said, was a preternatural ability to articulate exactly what he wanted Summly to be. \u201cThere were no umms, no uhhs, no hesitations, no insecurities,\u201d Mr. Wong said.         \n\nMr. D\u2019Aloisio, for his part, sounded somewhat uninterested in answering questions about his age on Monday. He acknowledged that it was an advantage in some pitch meetings, and certainly in the news media, \u201cbut so was the strength of the idea.\u201d He was more eager to talk about his new employer, Yahoo, which is trying to reinvent itself as a mobile-first technology company (having dropped the digital media tagline it used before Marissa Mayer became chief executive last year).         \n\n\u201cPeople are kind of underestimating how powerful it\u2019s going to become and how much opportunity is there,\u201d he said.         \n\nFor a company that badly wants to be labeled innovative, those words are worth a lot.         \n\nMr. D\u2019Aloisio\u2019s father, who works at Morgan Stanley, and his mother, a lawyer, had no special knowledge of technology. But they nurtured their son\u2019s fascination with it and he started coding at age 12. Eventually he decided to develop an app with what he calls an \u201cautomatic summarization algorithm,\u201d one that \u201ccan take pre-existing long-form content and summarize it.\u201d In other words, it tries to solve a problem that is often summed up with the abbreviation tl;dr: \u201ctoo long; didn\u2019t read.\u201d         \n\nSummly officially came online last November. By December, Mr. D\u2019Aloisio was talking to Yahoo and other suitors.         \n\nYahoo said in a statement that while the Summly app would be shut down, \u201cwe will acquire the technology and you\u2019ll see it come to life throughout Yahoo\u2019s mobile experiences soon.\u201d         \n\nOther news-reading apps have attracted corporate attention as of late, reflecting the scramble by media companies to adapt to skyrocketing traffic from mobile devices. The social network LinkedIn was said to be pursuing an app called Pulse earlier this month. Still, the eight-figure payday for a teenage entrepreneur on Monday struck some as outlandish and set off speculation that Yahoo was willing to pay almost any price for \u201ccool.\u201d         \n\nMr. D\u2019Aloisio, though, will have plenty of time to prove his and his algorithm\u2019s worth. As for the sizable paycheck from Yahoo, he said he did not have any specific plans for the sudden windfall. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be put into a trust fund and my parents will help manage it,\u201d he said.         \n\nHe did say, however, that \u201cangel investing could be really fun.\u201d When not working at Yahoo, he will keep up with his hobbies \u2014 cricket in particular \u2014 and set his sights on attending college at Oxford. His intended major is philosophy.
