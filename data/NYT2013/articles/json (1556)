{"headline": "Co-op Board Presidents Tell All", "body": "\nIntrigued by the dubious Zen of running a  \n co-op? You\u2019d better be a fiscally prudent paragon of cooperation and as thick-skinned as a piece of Vuitton luggage, because the only entity New Yorkers seem to distrust and disparage more than co-op boards is the board president him or herself.         \n\nPrepare to hear that you are a control freak on an ego trip. Prepare, in a worst-case scenario, to be threatened with bodily harm by a disgruntled neighbor: disgruntlement is commonplace among shareholders sensing something amiss on the home investment front.         \n\nDuring his stint as board president at Plaza 400, a 600-plus unit co-op at 400 East 56th Street, Stephen Chesnoff summoned the police one evening after the irate girlfriend of a shareholder banged on his apartment door and screamed, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you!\u201d         \n\nWhen you\u2019re board president, said Mr. Chesnoff, who survived the incident by keeping his door locked, \u201ceveryone seems to know where you live.\u201d         \n\nSo install a good lock and plan to hover in the hot seat at interminable board meetings instead of doing something constructive like, say, snoozing in the apartment for which you fork over that hefty monthly maintenance fee. \u201cI get paid in heartbreak and agita,\u201d said Matthew LaPorte, the president of the board at the Doric Apartments in Union City, N.J., \u201cand think of it like this great, or maybe not-so-great, hobby I do several hours a week as opposed to sleeping or working at the job I actually do get paid for.\u201d He was joking, sort of.         \n\nHis father had been the president of two  \n co-ops; when informed that his son was about to replicate his footsteps, \u201che told me I was stupid.\u201d Mr. LaPorte joined the board at the 435-unit co-op in 2009 and became its president last June.         \n\nHis tenure has yielded mixed results: heralded for installing a state-of-the-art gym, yet vilified for raising guest parking fees to $15 from $10 a day. \u201cEven though most residents can\u2019t be bothered to attend meetings,\u201d he said, \u201cthey always have time to interrupt me when I\u2019m walking the dog. So twice a day I stop and answer questions or complaints. Every once in a blue moon I get a compliment.\u201d         \n\nAccording to Michael Vargas, the chief executive officer of Vanderbilt Appraisal, New York City has 6,800 co-ops, more than half concentrated in Manhattan. Which means that nearly 7,000 city residents, whether motivated by altruism or megalomania, are employing their social skills and fiscal finesse in the woefully \u2014 just ask \u2014 underappreciated role of co-op board president.         \n\n\u201cOf all the fun things I could have done with my time, I wouldn\u2019t say it was fun,\u201d said Terri Feinstein Sasanow, a lawyer for the New York City Law Department who was on her co-op board at 1 Gracie Terrace for a dozen years, the last six as president. \u201cTo a certain extent it can be a thankless task.\u201d         \n\nThe most incendiary conflicts are often the most picayune. \u201cWe had disagreements over the wallpaper in the halls and the fresh flowers in the lobby,\u201d Ms. Sasanow recalled. \u201cThere was one lady who sat in the front row at every meeting and complained about the flowers; I thought it was nice that we even had fresh flowers.\u201d         \n\nFriction among board members is a given. But when manipulative presidents with personal agendas take control \u2014 urging a building to soften or toughen its policy on washer/dryers or pets or terrace expansions, for example \u2014 what ensues can be even worse.         \n\nAaron Shmulewitz, the head of the co-op/condo practice at Belkin Burden Wenig & Goldman, represents more than 250 co-op and condo boards.         \n\n\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d he said, \u201csome board presidents allow the position to go to their heads and behave as if they\u2019ve acquired the rights of a medieval European monarch. Everyone else relies on them to make all the decisions and take all the heat, which leads to a situation where the president starts to think, \u2018Hey, I have absolute power and I can do whatever the heck I want.\u2019\u00a0\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/28/realestate/co-op-board-presidents-tell-all.html", "date": "2013-04-26", "description": "Why presidents of co-op boards need thick skins."}
