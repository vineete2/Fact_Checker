{"headline": "A Push to Sell Testosterone Gels Troubles Doctors", "body": "\nThe barrage of advertisements targets older men. \u201cHave you noticed a recent deterioration of your ability to play sports?\u201d \u201cDo you have a decrease in sex drive?\u201d \u201cDo you have a lack of energy?\u201d         \n\nIf so, the ads warn, you should \u201ctalk to your doctor about whether you have low  \n\u201d \u2014 \u201cLow T,\u201d as they put it.         \n\nIn the view of many physicians, that is in large part an invented condition. Last year, drug makers in the United States spent $3.47 billion on advertising directly to consumers, according to  \n. And while ever-present ads like those from AbbVie Pharmaceuticals have buoyed sales of testosterone gels, that may be bad for patients as well as the United States\u2019 $2.7 trillion annual health care bill, experts say.         \n\nSales of prescription testosterone gels that are absorbed through the skin generated over $2 billion in American sales last year, a number that is expected to more than double by 2017. Abbott Laboratories \u2014 which owned AbbVie until Jan. 1 \u2014 spent $80 million advertising its version, AndroGel, last year.         \n\nOnce a niche treatment for people suffering from hormonal deficiencies caused by medical problems like endocrine tumors or the disruptive effects of  \n, the prescription gels are increasingly being sold as lifestyle products, to raise dipping levels of the male sex hormone as men age.         \n\n\u201cThe market for testosterone gels evolved because there is an appetite among men and because there is advertising,\u201d said Dr. Joel Finkelstein, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School who is studying male hormone changes with aging. \u201cThe problem is that no one has proved that it works and we don\u2019t know the risks.\u201d         \n\nDr. Eric Topol, a cardiologist and chief academic officer at Scripps Health in San Diego, is alarmed by the high percentage of patients he sees who use the roll-on prescription products, achieving testosterone levels that he described as \u201cridiculously high.\u201d         \n\nThe gels are of questionable medical benefit for many of the millions of men who now take them, he and other doctors say, and their side effects may well prove dangerous.         \n\n\u201cThese medicines come with a risk of coronary artery disease,\u201d Dr. Topol said.         \n\n\u201cWhen I ask patients why they\u2019re on it, the instant response, is, \u2018I have low T.\u2019 I ask, \u2018Why would you even get tested for that?\u2019 There isn\u2019t really a normal,\u201d he said. Other side effects include an  \n, he added.         \n\nNevertheless, many insurers cover the cost of the high-priced hormone treatments, requiring only a small co-payment from patients. AndroGel and another popular testosterone gel, Axiron, by Eli Lilly & Company, sell for more than $500 a month retail, and about $400 with pharmacy coupons.         \n\nMany experts say that pharmaceutical advertising promotes excessive and inappropriate drug use by convincing patients that they are ill \u2014 or have a more serious condition than is genuinely the case \u2014 and need medicine to treat it. While television viewers are barraged with advertising warning men they may have \u201clow T,\u201d Dr. Finkelstein said, \u201cThere is no such disease.\u201d         \n\nSuch advertising also leads patients to seek out more expensive treatments, rather than cheaper ones that are often equally effective. Drugs that are advertised are almost always the ones that are costly.         \n\nIn response to an article Sunday in The New York Times  \n in the United States, a number of readers complained about the high price of inhalers, and that the costs were inflated by the millions of dollars pharmaceutical companies spend on advertising for them.         \n\nJack D. from Philadelphia, for example, wrote that he mail-ordered his prescription  \n nasal spray from overseas, for 20 percent of the price in the United States. \u201cI refuse to pay for ads featuring talking bees with Spanish accents,\u201d he wrote. Merck spent $46.3 million last year advertising Nasonex, its popular steroid spray.         \n\nPatients of any age may benefit from testosterone replacement if their levels are severely low because of serious medical problems, experts say. But testosterone normally declines as men age \u2014 just as  \n does in women.         \n\nThe F.D.A. has approved the gels \u201cfor use in men who either no longer produce the male sex hormone testosterone or produce it in very low amounts.\u201d But that directive is ambiguous, and the F.D.A. office did not respond to questions because of the government shutdown.         \n\nShould testosterone be replaced in older men, and will it safely redress frequent ordinary symptoms of male aging, like decreased muscle mass and libido? And what constitutes a very low amount?         \n\nDr. Finkelstein said, \u201cUntil there are big long-term studies to address the issues of testosterone replacement, we\u2019re not ready to make recommendations on that.\u201d         \n\nBut drug companies defend their efforts to reach out to potential users. Testosterone deficiency is \u201ca recognized clinical condition, with signs/symptoms that can impact millions of patients,\u201d said Morry B. Smulevitz, a director of communications for Lilly, which makes Axiron. While he said the company did not condone the use of medicine for purposes other than those approved by the F.D.A., it \u201cencouraged patients to talk to their physicians to weigh the risks and benefits.\u201d         \n\nDavid Freundel, director of public affairs for AbbVie, which makes AndroGel, said the company\u2019s \u201clow testosterone efforts\u201d were \u201cdeveloped to educate men who may be at risk for, or have, low testosterone, so they can have the appropriate dialogue with their physician to determine if testing and treatment may be appropriate.\u201d         \n\nStudies are just beginning to yield results to address the appropriate use of the drug in older men. For example, scientists have found that age-related male changes in body fat depend on a different hormone, estradiol, which also decreases with age. Likewise, while strength and libido do decrease with falling testosterone levels, that effect may not be significant until testosterone levels are very low, Dr. Finkelstein said. Low testosterone is rarely the main cause of  \n.         \n\nFinally, he added, no one has really defined what is a \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201cphysiological\u201d testosterone level. And yet, physicians often order tests for \u201clow T.\u201d         \n\n \n found that more than half of physicians felt that pharmaceutical advertising to consumers should be scaled back, and 63 percent said it misinformed patients.         \n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s tolerated at a time we\u2019re struggling with health care costs,\u201d Dr. Topol said. \u201cA lot of people bounce their legs in meetings, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have  \n, and you shouldn\u2019t be taking drugs for that.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/16/us/a-push-to-sell-testosterone-gels-troubles-doctors.html", "date": "2013-10-15", "description": "Many doctors worry about the risks of prescription gels that are increasingly being sold as lifestyle products, to raise dipping levels of the male sex hormone as men age."}
