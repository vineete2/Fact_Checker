But it is telling of the sorry state of some of Germany\u2019s roads and bridges: His company is driving the turbines to a ferry, shipping them north to Denmark and then driving them south again back into Germany.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how bad it is,\u201d Mr. Dechant said recently, explaining the 186-mile detour in his office here. \u201cWe just haven\u2019t invested enough. And now there is trouble because there is no easy button to fix it all.\u201d         \n\nGermany was once known for its superfast autobahns, efficient industry and ability to rally public resources for big projects, like integration with the former East Germany. But more recently, it has been forced to confront a somewhat uncharacteristic problem: Its infrastructure \u2014 roads, bridges, train tracks, waterways and the like \u2014 is aging in a way that experts say could undermine its economic growth for years to come.         \n\nAs it has been preaching austerity to its neighbors, Germany itself has kept a tight rein on spending at home. Now critics abroad, including the European Union and the United States, are pressing it to do more to stimulate its own economy, and Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s likely partners in a new coalition government, the left-leaning Social Democrats, are seeking more money for a variety of domestic programs.         \n\nA good place to start plowing money into, many experts say, is the nation\u2019s physical underpinnings. A government-appointed commission recently concluded that it needed to spend 7.2 billion euros a year, or $9.7 billion, for the next 15 years \u2014 roughly 70 percent more than it spends now \u2014 just to get existing infrastructure back into shape. Others say that even more is needed for schools, for instance, and for extending fiber optic cables to less populated areas.         \n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t spend,\u201d said Kurt Bodewig, who heads the government commission, \u201cthen I think that Germany will fall behind. If we don\u2019t spend, then the next factories will not be built here.\u201d         \n\nAn earlier report by the German Institute for Economic Research was even harsher in its assessment, saying that other European Union countries were doing far more to ensure their futures. \u201cIt is high time that Germany handles its lack of investment,\u201d the report said.         \n\nIt is not clear where the money might come from, especially given the aversion of Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservatives to higher taxes. The $270 million budget surplus projected for next year, even if given over entirely to roads and bridges, would not be nearly enough to match what the government commission said was needed, and there are many other issues competing for funding. One solution may be a highway toll. Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservative partners in Bavaria are insisting on such a tax, which could be paired with reductions on existing taxes on domestic drivers and businesses but affect millions of foreign citizens and businesses traversing Germany.         \n\nSome critics worry that even if additional money starts flowing in soon, it may not come in time to avoid major problems, which are already beginning to surface. A year ago this month, inspectors found tears in the steel supports under a major highway bridge outside Cologne, Germany\u2019s fourth-largest city. Officials quickly restricted traffic and banned heavy trucks, forcing detours to four other bridges around the city that, officials now say, will need $202 million worth of repairs. The detours were costly to local businesses and backed traffic up for miles each day.         \n\nAlmost immediately, companies in the area began pressing the Federation of German Industry do something. The business association, which is now pushing for spending at least an additional $5.4 billion a year on maintenance, has calculated that the partial closing of that bridge cost local industry 60 million to 80 million euros (about $80 million to $110 million) during a three-month period.
