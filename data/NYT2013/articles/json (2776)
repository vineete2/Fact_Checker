{"headline": "Corruption in Peru Aids Cutting of Rain Forest", "body": "\nPUCALLPA, Peru \u2014 Afraid the police would tip off suspects, Francisco Berrospi kept local officers in the dark when he headed into the rain forest as a prosecutor to investigate illegal logging. Sometimes it hardly seemed to matter, though.         \n\nEven when he managed to seize trucks, chain saws or illegally harvested trees, judges would often force him to give them back, he said. Bribes were so common, he said, that one anticorruption official openly encouraged him to take them.         \n\n\u201cThe power of the logging industry here is very strong,\u201d Mr. Berrospi said. \u201cThe corruption is terrible.\u201d         \n\nMore than half of Peru is covered by dense forest, including a wide stretch of the Amazon basin, which spreads across South America. Its preservation is considered central to combating global warming and protecting the many species of plants and animals found only in the region.         \n\nIn recent years, Peru has passed laws to crack down on illegal logging, as required by a 2007 free trade agreement with the United States. But large quantities of timber, including increasingly rare types like mahogany, continue to flow out, much of it ultimately heading to the United States for products like hardwood flooring and decking sold by American retailers.         \n\nThe World Bank estimates that as much as 80 percent of Peru\u2019s logging exports are harvested illegally, and officials say the wood typically gets shipped using doctored paperwork to make the trade appear legal.         \n\nIt is a pattern seen in other parts of the world, including the far east of Russia, where environmentalists have documented the rampant illegal logging of oak and other kinds of wood bound for the United States and elsewhere.         \nHardwood timber from Russia\u2019s Far East is being illegally cut and shipped to China to feed huge consumer demand for cheap wood products globally. \n\nIn September, federal agents in Virginia served search warrants on Lumber Liquidators, a major American retailer, in what the company said was an investigation into its importation of wood flooring products.         \n\nThe company has been accused by environmentalists of regularly buying from a Chinese supplier that traffics in illegally harvested Russian oak. Lumber Liquidators disputes the claims, saying that it carefully monitors the origins of its wood.         \n\nHere in Pucallpa, a city at the heart of Peru\u2019s logging industry on a major tributary of the Amazon, the waterfront is dominated by huge sawmills piled high with thousands of massive logs. They are floated in from remote logging camps, pulled by small motorboats called peke pekes, while trucks stacked with logs and lumber jam the roads.         \n\nA military officer stationed here to patrol the Ucayali River said that he had largely stopped making checks of the riverborne loads of timber, though the checks are supposed to be mandatory. In the past, he said, he had repeatedly ordered loads of logs to be held because they lacked the required paperwork, only to learn that forestry officials would later release them, apparently after creating or rubber-stamping false documentation.         \n\nIn some cases, he said, loads of mahogany, a valuable type of wood that has disappeared from all but the most remote areas, were given fake documentation identifying the wood as a different kind.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s uncontrollable,\u201d said the officer, who was not authorized to speak publicly. Referring to local forestry officials, he said, \u201cThe bosses give jobs to people they trust and then take a cut of the bribes they get.\u201d         \n\nMr. Berrospi, who worked as an environmental prosecutor until August, recited a bitter catalog of frustrations. The local authorities are paid off by loggers to create or approve false paperwork, he said. On one occasion, he said, he was offered about $5,000 to stop an investigation. He reported it to a local prosecutor who specialized in corruption cases, but said he was dismayed by the response.         \n\n\u201cListen, in one year here you\u2019ll get enough to build yourself a house and buy a nice car,\u201d he recalled the other prosecutor saying. \u201cSo take care of yourself.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/19/world/americas/corruption-in-peru-aids-cutting-of-rain-forest.html", "date": "2013-10-18", "description": "The World Bank estimates that 80 percent of Peru\u2019s logging exports are illegally harvested, a problem compounded by bribery and obstacles to prosecution."}
