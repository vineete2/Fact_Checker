{"headline": "A Special Purchase to Curb Behavior Could, Just as Easily, Terrify a Pet", "body": "\nBACK in March, I wrote about a wily raccoon that kept sneaking into our house through a swinging cat door.         \n\nWe thought we had solved the problem by installing a new door that opens by radio frequency emitted from the tags on our cats\u2019 collars. The only problem was that the cats hated the noise the door made and refused to use it.         \n\nWe hoped they\u2019d get used to it.         \n\nBut six months later, Archie and Lily still view it with the same petrified stare as they did in the beginning.         \n\nThat made me wonder about other pet problems and the products that owners buy to solve them.         \n\nThere\u2019s a caveat. What works for one pet may prove disastrous for another: different pets, different temperaments and different owners. Nonetheless, it can be useful to hear what some animal behavior experts and longtime pet owners suggest \u2014 or don\u2019t \u2014 and why.         \n\nAfter all, Americans spent $53.3 billion on pet products last year, more than $12 billion of that for supplies and over-the-counter medicine, according to the American Pet Products Association.         \n\nFirst, what about sprays that are supposed to stop your cat from scratching your furniture? I\u2019ve bought several bottles of different brands and spritzed them on the arms of the living room chairs. The cats walk up, sniff and then proceed to shred the chair as usual.         \n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t had much luck with sprays,\u201d said Stephen L. Zawistowski, a science adviser to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. He suggested putting double-sided tape, aluminum foil or Bubble Wrap on the places the cats like to scratch, while offering them a scratching post nearby.         \n\nThat strategy has worked for me. I put catnip on a flat, corrugated cardboard box, and the cats claw away. It is the Trader Joe\u2019s Double Wide Cat Scratcher and costs about $7.         \n\nOther sprays that promise to get rid of urine smells rarely do. Almost everyone I spoke to, including a friend who is down to five cats from eight, said none of them seemed to truly work.         \n\nThe idea behind all these products, such as the most common, Nature\u2019s Miracle, is not only to dispel the unpleasant odor for humans, but to discourage the pets from urinating in the same spot again.         \n\n\u201cI no longer buy any of them,\u201d my friend said. \u201cI mix together half vinegar and half water with three to four drops of Dawn liquid dishwashing detergent and use it.\u201d It seems to work, she said, even though it sometimes makes her house smell like salad dressing.         \n\nAutomatic litter boxes don\u2019t seem to have a lot of fans. They work this way: Sometime after the cat has done its business, a rake runs through the litter and deposits the excrement into a bag.         \n\nBesides being expensive \u2014 $100 and up \u2014 Mr. Zawistowski said that if the automatic cleaner started while the cats were in the box, it could frighten them so much they would avoid it altogether. If you own multiple cats, one can jump in after the first and \u201cyou have to make sure it doesn\u2019t operate while the second cat is in the box,\u201d he said.         \n\nA cat behavior that most of us find rather distasteful is the inclination to drink from toilets. One solution is to lower the toilet seat, but with two teenage boys in the house, it might be easier to train the cats to shut the lid.         \n\nSome suggest buying drinking fountains, but Megan Lynch, a cat owner, reported, \u201cOur cat was terrified of the sound it made and didn\u2019t want to go near it. We kept it for a month or so to see if he\u2019d warm up to it, but he continued to regard it as an alien being that we had inexplicably brought into our home.\u201d         \n\nCats may drink from toilet bowls because the water can be fresher and cooler than water that\u2019s been sitting in a bowl all day, Mr. Zawistowski said. That\u2019s why he suggested refilling the bowl several times a day, wiping it out each time with a paper towel and then giving it a good scrubbing every few days.         \n\nNow on to dogs. One common product \u2014 retractable leashes \u2014 provoked the ire of several experts.
