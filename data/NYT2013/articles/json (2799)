{"headline": "Carrie, Love Your Work!", "body": "\nHow the years fly! Only four decades ago, Carrie White was a misunderstood 17-year-old, flinging her mother across the room, dousing her mean schoolmates with blood. Now she is a successful entrepreneur of 55, with yet another box office hit about her life. Her business ventures over the years have been many: interior designer (conflict-of-interest disclosure, I once hired Carrie to move the furniture around my house); crane operator; transplant surgeon (The sight of a donor heart hovering over the operating table, which can be found on YouTube, is mesmerizing).         \n\nI hesitated to even ask for an interview \u2014 you know what happens when Carrie gets annoyed. But the way she stands up for herself is such an inspiration for boomers, I went for it.         \n\nWe meet at a popular bar in the West Village. I am just arriving when I see Carrie roar up on a vintage Indian motorcycle, telekinetically heave a Prius parked in front of the restaurant into the air, slam it down next to a fire hydrant, and pull into the space. Getting off her bike, she shoots me a bad girl smile.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019d tell you I never do that, but I\u2019d be lying,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t stomach those wimps: \u2018No more fossil fuels, whine, whine, whine.\u2019 I suppose it\u2019s too cold to get a table outside and watch it getting towed off.\u201d         \n\nThere are not many women in their 50s who can carry the Altamont biker look, but on Carrie the leathers look good. And there was a raffish bad girl charm to the tattoos on her fingers that read P-R-O-M N-I-T-E. We make our way to a corner table, where Carrie orders a scotch, straight up, and cheekily puts her little steel-toed boots on the table. I have my usual Virgin Cosmo. Then I struggle to make myself heard over the cellphone screamers.         \n\n\u201cCarrie,\u201d I say, \u201cYou were pushed around as a teenager, but you\u2019ve turned into an extremely powerful woman. The critics raved about your book, \u2018Lean In and Push Them Over the Edge and Put a Foot on Their Head if They Survive the Fall and Manage to Claw Their Way Back\u2019 \u2014 but so much of that dealt with family. How do you apply your talents to the problems of every day life, like all these young people around us hollering into their phones?\u201d         \n\nCarrie nods sympathetically.         \n\n\u201cThe cell zombies,\u201d she says. \u201cI just telekinetically raise the phone a foot in the air, whack them on the head with it a few times, then I use my mental powers to dip the phone slowly into their water glass and watch them freak out. That\u2019s the best part.\u201d         \n\nI couldn\u2019t help but sigh enviously.         \n\n\u201cOh, Carrie,\u201d I say, \u201cIt must be wonderful to be you. Now, while many of our readers still think of you as that adorable teenager in a blood-drenched prom grown, you are now a mother yourself. Do you have any child-raising tips?\u201d         \n\n\u201cYou gotta be tough with kids, Joyce,\u201d Carrie says. \u201cWhen my daughter got out of line, I grounded her. Made her think about the consequences of her actions in her bedroom.\u201d         \n\n\u201cHow long did you keep her there?\u201d I ask.         \n\n\u201cFrom the time she was 14 to about 18,\u201d Carrie says, \u201cYou know, the difficult years.\u201d         \n\nI admit I was a little shocked.         \n\n\u201cYou know, Carrie,\u201d I say. \u201cThis makes you sound like your own mother, who used to lock you in the closet.\u201d         \n\nCarrie tosses back her drink and shot me one of those looks that make you feel you might be conducting the remainder of the interview glued to the ceiling.         \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have any kids, do you?\u201d she says. \u201cRight, didn\u2019t think so.\u201d         \n\nI feel it best to get back on safer ground.         \n\n\u201cLet\u2019s talk about noisy neighbors,\u201d I say. \u201cHow do you deal with that?\u201d         \n\nCarrie sneers.         \n\n\u201cThose creeps,\u201d she says. \u201cI wait until it\u2019s the middle of the night when I know they\u2019re finally asleep. Then I have the telemarketers call and say, \u2018Would you like to contribute to Waterparks Worldwide so impoverished children don\u2019t have to continue taking the Hydro Plunge into sewage-filled lakes? Why not? Do you hate children? How about I come over to your house and dump a little raw sewage on your head and see how you like it?\u2019 I own a number of telemarketing companies, as you might have suspected. A few nights of calls, they\u2019re too tired to make noise. \u201c         \n\nSo no more blood drenching?         \n\n\u201cAfter the first 20 years, it gets old,\u201d Carrie says. \u201cLike Tony Bennett and \u2018San Francisco.\u2019 You know he hired me once and told me to shove the face of the first guy who asked him to sing that song into whatever he was eating. It was pasta e fagioli, so you can imagine.\u201d         \n\nI was shocked.         \n\n\u201cTony Bennett asked you to do that?\u201d I say.         \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not the nice guy everybody thinks,\u201d Carrie says. \u201cBut here\u2019s the dirty little secret: Nobody is, when you have my kind of power. Telekinetic power corrupts. Absolute telekinetic power corrupts absolutely.\u201d         \n\nI look over at the guy who\u2019d been hollering into his phone throughout our interview.         \n\n\u201cEven so, it would be great to be able to do it,\u201d I say. \u201cThat thing we talked about with the cellphone, where you whack someone on the head. Could you do it to that guy?\u201d         \n\n\u201cYou kidding?\u201d Carrie says. \u201cYou know what it took out of me to throw that car out of the space when I got here? I\u2019m not a teenager any more. One telekinetic event and I\u2019m shot.\u201d         \n\n\u201cSo what could you do?\u201d I ask.         \n\nCarrie walks over to the guy.         \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re disturbing people,\u201d she says. \u201cGet off the phone.\u201d         \n\nThe guy quickly shuts it off.         \n\nCarrie turns to me.         \n\n\u201cTry it some time,\u201d she says.
