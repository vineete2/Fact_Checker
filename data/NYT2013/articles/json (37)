{"headline": "Bonds (and Everyone) Strikes Out", "body": "\nIn the most resounding referendum yet on the legacy of steroids in baseball, voters for the Hall of Fame emphatically rejected the candidacies of  \n and  \n in balloting results announced on Wednesday.         \n\nIn their first year on the ballot, Bonds and Clemens, perhaps the most decorated hitter and pitcher in the game\u2019s history, fell far short of receiving the necessary 75 percent of votes from baseball writers. Bonds, the career home runs leader, received only 36.2 percent, while Clemens, who won a record seven Cy Young Awards, did slightly better, with 37.6.         \n\nIt was the first election since 1996 in which the writers chose no new members.         \n\n\u201cIt takes time for history to sort itself out,\u201d said Jeff Idelson, the Hall of Fame\u2019s president. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised we had a shutout today. I wish we had an electee, but I\u2019m not surprised given how volatile this era has been.\u201d         \n\nFor a sport whose links to performance-enhancing drugs have forced it to endure Congressional hearings, public apologies from players, tell-all books and federal trials, Wednesday offered a profound moment. Writers decreed that two of baseball\u2019s greatest players would not be officially recognized with the game\u2019s highest honor, at least for now and perhaps forever.         \n\nThe Hall of Fame will still have its annual induction ceremony in Cooperstown, N.Y., this summer. But the three who will be honored \u2014 the umpire Hank O\u2019Day, the owner Jacob Ruppert and a catcher, Deacon White \u2014 all died in the 1930s and were voted in by the veterans\u2019 committee in December rather than through the more prestigious route of being selected by the members of the Baseball Writers\u2019 Association of America. (The New York Times does not permit its reporters to vote for awards.)         \n\nAs a result, it will be the first time since 1960 that the induction ceremony will include no new, living honorees, underscoring the lingering damage that the issue of drugs is inflicting on the sport.         \n\nClemens, in a message posted to his Twitter account, said that \u201cafter what has been written and said over the last few years I\u2019m not overly surprised.\u201d Bonds did not immediately comment, but lamented in an interview with  \n in November that \u201cit\u2019s tough when you have so many people out there who don\u2019t want to turn the page and want to be angry at you forever.\u201d         \n\nEvery player on the 2013 ballot was active in the years before steroid testing, which began, with penalties, in 2004. Some have escaped suspicion, like the top two finishers in this election. Craig Biggio of the Houston Astros, who amassed 3,060 hits, made his debut on the ballot at 68.2 percent, followed by the former pitcher Jack Morris, who got 67.7 percent in his 14th year as a candidate.         \n\nOthers, like the former Mets catcher  \n and the former Houston first baseman Jeff Bagwell, were muscle-bound sluggers in an era when many such players used steroids. They are viewed skeptically by some but have never been formally linked to performance enhancers, and both got more votes than Bonds and Clemens \u2014 59.6 percent for Bagwell and 57.8 percent for Piazza, who was also on the ballot for the first time.         \n\nThree others with more than 500 career home runs and strong links to performance enhancers were essentially placed in a Cooperstown coffin in the latest voting.  \n, who has admitted his use of performance enhancers, received just 16.9 percent support, the lowest figure in his seven years on the ballot. Rafael Palmeiro, who tested positive in 2005, dropped to 8.8 percent, the lowest result in his three-year candidacy. And  \n, who was reported by The Times to have tested positive in 2003, made his debut on the ballot with 12.5 percent.         \n\nVoters can list up to 10 players on their ballot and are instructed to consider the integrity, sportsmanship and character of candidates, as well as their playing record. Jack O\u2019Connell, the secretary/treasurer of the writers\u2019 association, said members did not have to follow those guidelines, but stressed their historical importance.         \n\nConsidering a player\u2019s character, he said, \u201chas been there since the very first election of 1936, and it is something that was emphasized by the Hall of Fame itself.\u201d Nevertheless, the Hall has long included any number of inductees with character issues, including, in particular, blatant acts of racism.         \n\nThe former pitcher Curt Schilling, who made his debut on this year\u2019s ballot with 38.8 percent of the vote, wrote on Twitter that he would have voted for Bagwell, Biggio, Dale Murphy and Tim Raines. He did not mention Bonds or Clemens.         \n\nIn a 2002 article in Sports Illustrated, Schilling told the writer Tom Verducci that he had to be careful when patting fellow players on the backside because that was where they injected themselves with steroids. A decade later, Verducci is part of the voting bloc that will not support steroid users.
