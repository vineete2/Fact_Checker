{"headline": "The Summer I Discovered Suburbia", "body": "\nOne preteen summer, I was sent by my parents to Kent, Ohio, to spend a few days with my cousins, Jessica and Anna. They were close to my age and looked like me: Norwegian, with blond hair and blue eyes. They, and their parents, a dental hygienist and geographer, were warm and easygoing. And yet, when I arrived at their cozy two-story house, it felt like touching down on an alien planet.         \n\nGrowing up on St. Marks Place in Manhattan\u2019s East Village, I knew about suburban life only to the extent that it was documented in my favorite movie, \u201cGrease.\u201d So I had a vague idea of what drive-in movies were, but was otherwise at a total loss. \u201cWhat\u2019s a kiddie pool?\u201d I chirped, like a particularly oblivious foreign-exchange student. \u201cWhat\u2019s a Blizzard?\u201d \u201cHow do you score in football?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s a drum major?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s a Slip \u2019N Slide?\u201d \u201cHow does a curling iron work?\u201d Accustomed to splintery wooden floors, I was mesmerized by my aunt and uncle\u2019s wall-to-wall carpeting.         \n\nMy cousins \u2014 one was a gymnast, the other rode horses \u2014 were exotic and magical to me. Smelling faintly like Jean Nat\u00e9 body wash, with flawlessly hairsprayed bangs, they showed me the sights and pleasures of their hometown: the lawns and the game rooms, the bowling alleys and the Dairy Queens.         \n\nOhio was heaven. I loved riding bikes down empty sidewalks. I loved being covered with bug spray and lying in the backyard, looking at the stars. I loved that there always seemed to be roaming gangs of kids, snacks on paper plates and ice-cold cans of soda. I loved Blizzards (soft-serve ice cream from Dairy Queen, with candy mashed into it). As my parents tell it, when they picked me up from the airport, the first thing I said to them \u2014 people who had fled their suburban childhoods and prided themselves on having raised \u201ca city kid\u201d \u2014 was an enraged hiss: \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me about all that!\u201d         \n\nIt\u2019s not as though I was a deprived urchin back in New York. My best friend, Asia, and I lolled around in our only-child caves reading Betty and Veronica. In the evening, \u201cWorld News Tonight\u201d or the Mets game on in the background, my parents and I played Skip-Bo. On weekends, there was the Egyptian wing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. I had a pet rabbit, Ginger, who hopped around the apartment chewing the spines off our books. I was like Eloise at the Plaza, albeit public-schooled and living in a fifth-floor walk-up.         \n\nOhio scratched an itch I didn\u2019t know I had. Kent was made for kids. Nothing back in New York was for kids, not even the parks. I was born in March 1976, just a few months after President Gerald Ford suggested that the city, as The Daily News rendered it in the famous inflammatory headline, \u201cdrop dead.\u201d By the mid-\u201980s, Tompkins Square Park, just a block and a half away from us, had become a tent city, filled with junkies nodding off.         \n\nNow that I\u2019m a mother myself, I can see how growing up in a big city, even at its seediest \u2014 perhaps especially at its seediest \u2014 has advantages. Street smartness is a valuable internal mechanism; I\u2019ve found that a mugger-behind-every-mailbox-grade paranoia proves helpful in many areas of life. Besides, now I can\u2019t live anywhere else. I\u2019m conditioned to overstimulation. Except in small doses, any place with a population of less than a million makes me nervous.         \n\nSo I\u2019m raising my son, who just turned 7, one subway stop from where I grew up. I cringe as I hear myself echo my parents, but it\u2019s true: I\u2019m raising a city kid. My son loves the fossils at the American Museum of Natural History. He\u2019s a lightning-fast MetroCard swiper. But his New York is cleaner and safer than mine was, and there are far more children around. With his friends, he cruises the block on his bike and plays in open fire hydrants on hot days. He\u2019s getting the best of both worlds, I tell myself.         \n\nThen this summer we went to East Texas to visit my husband\u2019s family. There, our son frolicked with four cousins roughly his age in a backyard pool. He acquired a toy gun and a cowboy outfit at Baskins Western & Work Wear. We took him to a Sonic drive-in. As he drank his strawberry shake in the back seat of our air-conditioned rental car, cowboy hat on his head, he looked at me, eyes full of wonder and delight, and said, \u201cMom, I love it here!\u201d I know, son. I know.
