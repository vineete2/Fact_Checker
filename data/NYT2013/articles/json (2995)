{"headline": "A Time as  Fleeting as Waxwings", "body": "\n \n         \n\nMornings at our house begin with the sound of my son and his staccato pushing against the world. Autistic children, I have read, do not know where their bodies are in space and so they touch everything to feel where they are. Rory wakes up like a light switching on \u2014 full power \u2014 and begins thumping and drumming his way through the house, which wakes me. I lie in bed for a few minutes, listening. He goes to the computer room, talking out loud to himself as he starts his program, and then talking to the game that he is playing.         \n\nI come downstairs and head to the kitchen for coffee. Rory calls out, \u201cMom?\u201d as I pass the computer room and I answer, \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d In the kitchen I lean against the counter while the coffee pot makes sounds like Darth Vader. I stare out of the window. There is a tree just beyond the holly bush that is covered with bright red berries all year long. I don\u2019t know what kind of tree it is. I keep meaning to find out. Birds are attracted to the berries but disappointed when they taste them so we keep five or six feeders in the tree so that the birds will come back. The usual crowd is out there: chickadees, titmice, finches, nuthatches and a downy woodpecker or two. I breathe in the smell of coffee while I watch them.         \n\nMy daughter is the next arrival. I hear her behind me, settling into a corner of the couch where she will huddle and listlessly brush out her thick long hair. Addie is 8 and she begins each day gathered tightly within herself: in the mornings she is quiet, pale and totally lacking personality. I know that she will refuse breakfast, and that if I talk, the most I can hope for is a monosyllabic response from her. She unfolds slowly each day, gathering color and speed, until evening when she is flushed rosy and her eyes shoot out sparks as she does cartwheels and walkovers and round-offs around the living room.         \n\nMy husband, Harley, comes downstairs last, looking rumpled and groggy, his hair sticking up in tufts. He is the most likely to try some sort of cheery \u201cGood morning!\u201d but we\u2019re not really that sort of family. He heads straight to the refrigerator and the jug of black coffee that he keeps inside, and then pours the contents down his throat. No sensual pleasure in this morning cup of coffee; he is simply tanking up. He is wearing bright green scrubs. He wears them every day because so far no one has told him he can\u2019t. The other doctors wear white lab coats, with a shirt and sometimes a tie beneath them. My husband says he has tactile defensiveness, a trait common among autistic people, and so he prefers the soft, jammie-like scrubs. The rest of his wardrobe comes from the Swap Shop, the room of stuff free for the taking at our local dump. He finds flannel shirts and sweatpants worn to the point of transparency there.         \n\nSometimes, when we\u2019re playing Blame That Gene, I let him have tactile defensiveness, along with ultimate responsibility for the pain our son has endured in his short life. Better that than wondering how my decision to wait until my mid-30s to have children may have affected things. Other times I figure he just doesn\u2019t give a damn about how he looks, and besides that, he is cheap, which is why he is now washing his head in the kitchen sink. It wastes less water than a shower. He scrubs his hair, rinses it and then bobs up and down over the sink, hinging at the waist like the Drinking Bird I had as a child, and shaking the water from his head.         \n\nRory has entered the big room that is both our kitchen and living room, and he is pulling open cabinets, searching for his current favorite cereal, Reese\u2019s Puffs. We arrive at the refrigerator at the same time for cream for my coffee and milk for his cereal. As I am reaching into the fridge Rory is right behind me, and then he steps in closer and plants his feet \u2014 bam! bam! \u2014 a fraction of an inch behind my heels to let me know that he is waiting in line but doesn\u2019t like it.         \n\n\u201cWould you like to get in here?\u201d I ask, slipping around him.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not answering you,\u201d he answers.
