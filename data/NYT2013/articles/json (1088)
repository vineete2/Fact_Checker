{"headline": "A New Mayor Likes the Red Sauce Simple", "body": "\nNew York\u2019s mayors have often seemed to govern from a corner table.         \n\nEdward I. Koch cut a wide swath through the city\u2019s restaurants, from the Peking Duck House to the Four Seasons, dining on porchetta and fatty pastrami, with little regard for his arteries. (After a successful quadruple bypass in 2009, he  \n and their spouses to dinner at Peter Luger Steakhouse.) Rudolph W. Giuliani had his favorite spots in Little Italy and the Upper East Side. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who eats out most nights, favors clubby establishments like Quatorze Bis, Nippon and Shun Lee Palace.         \n\nAnd Mayor-elect  \n? His dining habits may change with the power and perks he acquires at his swearing-in on New Year\u2019s Day, but they are fairly well set. In keeping with his just-folks, no-frills style, his favorite New York restaurants have been a handful of modest places within a few blocks of his home in Park Slope, Brooklyn.         \n\nNow that he and his family \u2014 his wife, Chirlane McCray, and children, Chiara and Dante \u2014 are moving into Gracie Mansion, those local haunts are enjoying a flurry of attention, even as they say a bittersweet farewell to some of their most famous customers.         \n\nIn the statement announcing their decision to move, the de Blasios emphasized that they would return to Brooklyn as often as possible to visit places like  \n, a casual Italian restaurant on the corner of Sixth Avenue and 11th Street \u2014 half a block from where a police car now lingers in front of the de Blasio rowhouse. Bar Toto has been a staple of the family\u2019s life since it opened 12 years ago. Mr. de Blasio goes there for family dinners and business meetings, and listens patiently to other regulars who bend his ear about issues in the neighborhood.         \n\n\u201cWe knew he was going to run for mayor, so people would always say, \u2018There\u2019s the next mayor,\u2019 \u2018Here comes the next mayor,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Jodi Walter, an actress who tends bar at the restaurant. \u201cOf course, it was in good fun, but it came true.\u201d         \n\nShe said that while she would miss seeing the family as often, she understood their moving to Gracie Mansion. \u201cHow do you not?\u201d she said. \u201cThink of the parties you could throw.\u201d         \n\nIf the de Blasios do have parties, don\u2019t expect home cooking.         \n\nIn the early days of their marriage, Ms. McCray cooked often, sometimes working from Italian recipes passed along by Mr. de Blasio\u2019s mother: spinach pie, pasta e fagioli and Ms. McCray\u2019s favorite, baccal\u00e0 with onions, tomatoes, peppers and potatoes. But in recent years, Ms. McCray said, campaigning has left little time for cooking. And although she belonged to the Park Slope Food Co-op before she met Mr. de Blasio, the couple never joined together, knowing they couldn\u2019t keep up with its strict demands that members volunteer their labor.         \n\nInstead, they ate at restaurants like Bar Toto, a low-key neighborhood place where you are unlikely to find, say, white truffle risotto or fettuccine with bottarga. The food is simple: some basic pastas, pizzas, panini and burgers, plus the odd non-Italian item like hummus, with few dishes over $15.         \n\nWhat Bar Toto may lack in culinary distinction, it makes up for in friendliness. When Ms. McCray asked the owner, Peter Sclafani, to add a grilled shrimp salad to the menu so she would have another light option, he obliged. Mr. Sclafani and some Bar Toto regulars hold an annual block party, serving spaghetti puttanesca and homemade wine, where the de Blasios are often guests.         \n\nAnd the night before the November election, when Mr. Sclafani walked in to find Mr. de Blasio eating at the bar with a political consultant, Mr. Sclafani pulled out a few bottles of prosecco and led the whole restaurant in toasting the next mayor.         \n\nMr. de Blasio praised the warm atmosphere and the food, particularly the grilled chicken salad and, when he\u2019s more in the mood to indulge himself, the rigatoni with roasted eggplant and smoked mozzarella. \u201cThat\u2019s a Southern Italian soul food dish right there,\u201d he said.         \n\nMs. Walter, the bartender, said Mr. de Blasio often has a Moretti, a pale lager from Italy, or a glass of Nero d\u2019Avola, an Italian red.         \n\nThe de Blasios have a handful of other favorite restaurants that they either visit or order takeout from \u2014 the old-fashioned way, by telephone. (When asked if he used the meal-ordering website  \n, Mr. de Blasio replied, \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d)         \n\nThey are regulars at Smiling Pizzeria on Seventh Avenue at Ninth Street. Mr. de Blasio often has breakfast meetings at Little Purity, a diner on Seventh Avenue at 12th Street. The family orders mole poblano and other specialties from  \n, a homey restaurant on Fifth Avenue. Mr. Falafel, a little farther north on Seventh Avenue, still sports a \u201cDe Blasio for Mayor\u201d sign on the door; the owner, Aladdin Habib, said the de Blasios had been coming there for nearly two decades. \u201cThey eat very healthy,\u201d he said.         \n\nDuring one visit last fall, he recalled, people at the next table started peppering Mr. de Blasio with questions about the campaign. \u201cI said, \u2018Guys, wait until he finishes his food,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Habib said.         \n\nFor more special occasions, the de Blasios go to  \n, an Italian and Portuguese restaurant on Fifth Avenue that Mr. de Blasio praised for being quiet. They dined there with William J. Bratton and his wife, Rikki Klieman, shortly before Mr. de Blasio named Mr. Bratton as his police commissioner. (The de Blasios also like  \n, an Italian mainstay on Fifth Avenue, but Mr. de Blasio noted that its no-reservation policy makes it a difficult choice.)         \n\nWhether the de Blasios will find new hangouts near Gracie Mansion remains to be seen.  \n, a restaurant favored by mayors from Fiorello La Guardia to Mr. Giuliani, is 30 blocks away in East Harlem.         \n\nDespite their Everyman style, the demands of being the city\u2019s first family may induce them to hire a full-time chef. If not, they may want to learn to use Seamless.
