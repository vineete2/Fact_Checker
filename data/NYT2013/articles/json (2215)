{"headline": "Chinese Army Unit Is Seen as Tied to Hacking Against U.S.", "body": "\nOn the outskirts of Shanghai, in a run-down neighborhood dominated by a 12-story white office tower, sits a People\u2019s Liberation Army base for  \n\u2019s growing corps of cyberwarriors.         \n\nThe building off Datong Road, surrounded by restaurants, massage parlors and a wine importer, is the headquarters of P.L.A. Unit 61398. A growing body of digital forensic evidence \u2014 confirmed by American intelligence officials who say they have tapped into the activity of the army unit for years \u2014 leaves little doubt that an overwhelming percentage of the attacks on American corporations, organizations and government agencies originate in and around the white tower.         \n\nAn unusually detailed  \n, to be released Tuesday by Mandiant, an American computer security firm, tracks for the first time individual members of the most sophisticated of the Chinese hacking groups \u2014 known to many of its victims in the United States as \u201cComment Crew\u201d or \u201cShanghai Group\u201d \u2014 to the doorstep of the military unit\u2019s headquarters. The firm was not able to place the hackers inside the 12-story building, but makes a case there is no other plausible explanation for why so many attacks come out of one comparatively small area.         \n\n\u201cEither they are coming from inside Unit 61398,\u201d said Kevin Mandia, the founder and chief executive of Mandiant, in an interview last week, \u201cor the people who run the most-controlled, most-monitored Internet networks in the world are clueless about thousands of people generating attacks from this one neighborhood.\u201d         \n\nOther security firms that have tracked \u201cComment Crew\u201d say they also believe the group is state-sponsored, and a recent classified  \n, issued as a consensus document for all 16 of the United States intelligence agencies, makes a strong case that many of these hacking groups are either run by army officers or are contractors working for commands like Unit 61398, according to officials with knowledge of its classified content.         \n\nMandiant provided an advance copy of its report to The New York Times, saying it hoped to \u201cbring visibility to the issues addressed in the report.\u201d Times reporters then tested the conclusions with other experts, both inside and outside government, who have examined links between the hacking groups and the army\u00a0(Mandiant was hired by The New York Times Company to investigate a sophisticated Chinese-origin attack on its news operations, but concluded it was not the work of Comment Crew, but another Chinese group. The firm is not currently working for the Times Company but it is in discussions about a business relationship.)         \n\nWhile Comment Crew has drained terabytes of data from companies like Coca-Cola, increasingly its focus is on companies involved in the critical infrastructure of the United States \u2014 its electrical power grid, gas lines and waterworks. According to the security researchers, one target was a company with remote access to more than 60 percent of oil and gas pipelines in North America. The unit was also among those that attacked the computer security firm RSA, whose computer codes protect confidential corporate and government databases.         \n\nContacted Monday, officials at the Chinese embassy in Washington again insisted that their government does not engage in computer hacking, and that such activity is illegal. They describe China itself as a victim of computer hacking, and point out, accurately, that there are many hacking groups inside the United States. But in recent years the Chinese attacks have grown significantly, security researchers say. Mandiant has detected more than 140 Comment Crew intrusions since 2006. American intelligence agencies and private security firms that track many of the 20 or so other Chinese groups every day say those groups appear to be contractors with links to the unit.         \n\nAnd the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Tuesday that the allegations were \u2018\u2018unprofessional.\u2019\u2019         \n\n\u2018\u2018Making unfounded accusations based on preliminary results is both irresponsible and unprofessional, and is not helpful for the resolution of the relevant problem,\u2019\u2019 said Hong Lei, a ministry spokesman. \u2018\u2018China resolutely opposes hacking actions and has established relevant\u00a0 laws and regulations and taken strict law enforcement measures to defend against online hacking activities.\u2019\u2019        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/19/technology/chinas-army-is-seen-as-tied-to-hacking-against-us.html", "date": "2013-02-18", "description": "An overwhelming percentage of the attacks on American companies and government agencies start in a building on the edge of Shanghai, say cybersecurity experts and American intelligence officials."}
