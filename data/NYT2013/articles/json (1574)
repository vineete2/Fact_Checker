{"headline": "Foes Suggest a Tradeoff if Pipeline Is Approved", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014  \n\u2019s first major environmental decision of his second term could be to approve the  \n pipeline, profoundly disappointing environmental advocates who have made the project a symbolic test of the president\u2019s seriousness on  \n.         \n\nBut could some kind of deal be in the offing \u2014 a major climate policy announcement on, for example, power plant regulation or renewable energy incentives \u2014 to ease the sting of the pipeline approval?         \n\nWhite House and State Department officials insist a pipeline ruling will be made strictly on whether the 1,700-mile project is in the economic, environmental and security interests of the United States. They say the pipeline is not a fundamental piece of the nation\u2019s climate policy nor is it a political bargaining chip to trade for other measures.         \n\nAdministration officials have described the pipeline as a relatively simple permit application on an infrastructure project to transport oil from Alberta to refineries on the Gulf Coast.         \n\nBut to many environmentalists, including some of the president\u2019s most active campaign supporters, the issue has huge symbolic and political importance.         \n\nFor that reason, the approaching decision \u2014 expected some time this summer or early fall \u2014 offers the president a rare opportunity to set the parameters of the energy debate for the rest of his term and cement his legacy as the first president to seriously address climate change.         \n\n\u201cPresidents don\u2019t get many opportunities to make big dramatic announcements,\u201d said Paul Bledsoe, a former energy adviser in the Clinton White House and now a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund. \u201cIf and when he announces approval of Keystone, he has a once-in-a-term teachable moment on climate.\u201d         \n\nMr. Bledsoe suggested that the president use the opportunity to announce a new regime of regulation for existing coal-fired power plants, which account for a third of the nation\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions.         \n\nOthers suggest Mr. Obama could tie the decision to a renewed push on a national clean energy standard, requiring that a set proportion of the nation\u2019s electricity be produced from carbon-free sources by a given year. One former administration official even suggested an interesting formula \u2014 18 percent by 2018. \n         \n\nThere are a number of problems with such proposals, however.         \n\nFirst, pipeline opponents say there is no possible deal that could compensate for the environmental damage created by the construction of the pipeline and expanded development of the Canadian  \n. They have described the pipeline as a fuse to one of the biggest carbon bombs on the planet, and said that extracting and burning all the oil in the Alberta oil sands would mean the game was over for global climate.         \n\n\u201cApproving the pipeline would be a deep self-inflicted wound on the Obama administration, greater than anything else he has done,\u201d said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club and a leader of the antipipeline movement. \u201cThis was not inherited from the Bush administration and it can\u2019t be passed off to his successor. It really is Obama\u2019s alone. Whatever damage the decision would do to the environmental movement pales in comparison to the damage it would do to his own legacy.\u201d         \n\nMr. Brune and other environmental advocates say that Mr. Obama should veto the pipeline and pursue climate-friendly policies for their own sakes, not as part of some political deal. The danger to the climate of continuing on the current path demands strong steps like curbing coal-fired power and supporting renewable alternatives, he said.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to argue we should be developing new fossil fuel sources,\u201d said Mr. Brune,  \n at a Keystone protest earlier this year, \u201cbut particularly such a carbon-intensive source as the Canadian tar sands.\u201d         \n\nThere are other difficulties. Last year the Environmental Protection Agency proposed limiting carbon dioxide emissions from new power plants, effectively foreclosing construction of any new coal-burning facilities. But just last month the E.P.A.  \nsaying it needed to respond to public and industry concerns.         \n\nIt is unlikely the administration will take on the far more contentious and costly project of curbing greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants until the new plant rule is completed, or at least much further along than it is now. This week, Gina McCarthy, who is awaiting confirmation as the new E.P.A. administrator, told Senate Republicans in a written submission that the agency \u201cis not currently developing any existing-source G.H.G. regulations.\u201d G.H.G. is shorthand for greenhouse gas.         \n\nA clean energy standard, also known as a renewable portfolio standard, also presents problems. About 30 states already have such rules in place, with different targets and timelines. To impose such a regimen nationally, however, requires Congressional action, which is unlikely. A clean energy proposal last year from former Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, went nowhere and there is even less enthusiasm in the current Congress.         \n\n\u201cThe president can\u2019t do a clean energy standard on his own,\u201d said Robert Dillon, spokesman for Senator Lisa Murkowski, the senior Republican from Alaska on the Energy and Natural Resources committee. \u201cHe can\u2019t just order utilities to buy a certain amount of renewable energy.\u201d         \n\nHe asked, \u201cIs the goal to make energy cleaner? Or just to subsidize certain favored sectors of the renewable energy industry like wind and solar?\u201d         \n\nAnother possibility could be for Mr. Obama to extract promises from Canada to make development and transport of the oil less harmful to the environment.         \n\nBut Canadian officials bristle at such suggestions, saying Alberta has had a carbon tax in place since 2007 (although it is quite small) and that some of the proceeds are diverted to development of alternative energy. They also say  \n have dropped 26 percent a barrel since 1990 and will fall further. And Canada\u2019s overall greenhouse gas reduction target \u2014 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 \u2014 is the same as that of the United States.         \n\n\u201cNone of the environmental initiatives we have put in place were done to get the pipeline approved,\u201d Alison Redford, the premier of Alberta, said in a recent visit to Washington to lobby for Keystone. \u201cAnything we do has not and will not be done based on a quid pro quo.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/business/energy-environment/a-call-for-quid-pro-quo-on-keystone-pipeline-approval.html", "date": "2013-05-08", "description": "Should President Obama approve the 1,700-mile Keystone XL pipeline, some foes of the project say he ought to  address climate policy at the same time."}
