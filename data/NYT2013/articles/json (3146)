{"headline": "Yankees and Cano Are Said to Be Far Apart on Contract", "body": "\nAs the Yankees come to terms with the disappointment of 2013 and their failure to make the playoffs, the focus shifts to 2014 and a future that may not include  \n, their best and most durable player.         \n\nCano\u2019s representatives and the Yankees are far apart in contract negotiations, and there are skeptics on both sides on whether the gap can be bridged.         \n\nAccording to a person in baseball, who asked not to be identified because he was not permitted to speak publicly on the matter, Cano has asked for a 10-year, $310 million contract, essentially confirming an earlier  \n, which had the total at $305 million over 10 years.         \n\nThe person was told of the figures that were exchanged months ago. The Yankees, the person said, responded with a contract offer similar to David Wright\u2019s eight-year, $138 million deal with the Mets, but with no deferred money, making it worth more than Wright\u2019s deal and well more than Dustin Pedroia\u2019s eight-year, $110 million extension with the Boston Red Sox.         \n\nThe Yankees then updated their offer to around seven years at roughly $23 million per year, or about $161 million in base salary. There have been no discussions since, the person said.         \n\nA person close to Cano said recently that based on the gap in proposals, Cano is not likely to return to the Yankees.         \n\nCano, 30, is batting .315 this season with 27 home runs, 40 doubles and 106 runs batted in through Wednesday\u2019s game. His career batting average is .309, and since 2009 he has never hit fewer than 25 homers and 40 doubles in a season.         \n\nFrom 2007 to last year, he played in at least 159 games per year. This season was often calamitous for the Yankees, with one player after another sidelined with injuries, but Cano stayed on the field throughout, playing in 157 of 158 games to date.         \n\nCano, who can file for free agency after the season, is represented by Brodie Van Wagenen of C.A.A. Sports, operating under the umbrella of Jay Z\u2019s new sports agency, Roc Nation. Jay Z is from New York and is a Yankees fan and a friend of Alex Rodriguez, Cano\u2019s teammate, but more than anything he is a businessman. Reaching a big contract with his first marquee baseball free agent has to be more of a priority to him than any casual loyalty toward the  \n.         \n\n\u201cOut of respect to both parties, we have agreed all along with the Yankees not to comment publicly on discussions regarding Robinson\u2019s contractual future,\u201d Van Wagenen said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cI am abiding by that agreement.\u201d He added that Cano has not made \u201cany decisions on his future.\u201d         \n\nRodriguez\u2019s 10-year, $275 million deal, which does not expire until 2017, has tormented the Yankees, and they are understandably hesitant to give out another $200 million contract to anyone, and probably do not want to be paying Cano a huge salary as he nears 40.         \n\nIf Cano can get another team to give him close to $300 million, and that is an enormous \u201cif,\u201d the Yankees may let him leave.         \n\nSo, Cano becomes one more symbol of uncertainty for a franchise unsure of the status of Rodriguez, who may be suspended for much of next season; of Derek Jeter, who was barely able to play this season because of ankle and leg injuries; and of Manager Joe Girardi, who is unsigned for next year and may be intrigued by other jobs.         \n\nThis was only the second time in the last 19 seasons that the Yankees did not make it to the playoffs. It is not clear whether developments over the next few weeks and months will make them feel any more encouraged about the team.
