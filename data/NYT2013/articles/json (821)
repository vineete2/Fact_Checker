{"headline": "Morsi\u2019s Visitors Leave a Mystery on Where He Is", "body": "\nCAIRO \u2014 Mohamed Morsi, deposed as president by the Egyptian military on July 3, is in good health, a trickle of visitors allowed access to him and his aides in recent days has revealed. Where he is, however, remains a mystery that has enraged his family and supporters, and aggravated Egypt\u2019s crisis.         \n\nThe most recent person to visit him, Catherine Ashton, the European Union\u2019s top foreign policy official, was not blindfolded on Monday when she was taken to him, aides said. But she was flown by helicopter in the dark of night on the condition that she not reveal anything about Mr. Morsi\u2019s whereabouts.         \n\nA previous group of visitors, Egyptian human rights activists, described having to hand over their cellphones on Friday before boarding a helicopter that circled for 15 minutes in what appeared to be an effort to disorient them.         \n\n\u201cI think it might be a military camp outside Cairo or on the outskirts of Cairo, especially because when we landed, a car that belongs to the armed forces took us and wandered around the area for 10 minutes,\u201d one of the activists, Nasser Amin, told Al Masry Al Youm, an Egyptian newspaper.         \n\nThe military insists that its extreme caution comes from concern for Mr. Morsi\u2019s safety, though it is probably more worried that his supporters would seize even the vaguest information on his location to create a new focus for their rallies \u2014 particularly after two bloody crackdowns on their protests.         \n\nWhen Mr. Morsi\u2019s supporters thought that he was being held in the Republican Guard House in Cairo, they turned out there en masse. Security forces opened fire on them, killing more than 60 people in one of two mass killings by the security services in the past month.         \n\nLast week, prosecutors ordered Mr. Morsi\u2019s formal detention for 15 days pending an investigation into charges related to his escape from prison during the 2011 uprising against President Hosni Mubarak. The charges were part of an intensifying crackdown against the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamist groups that has resulted in arrest warrants or detention of Islamist leaders.         \n\nBut Mr. Morsi remains in legal and physical limbo. The military has so far refused to treat him like a criminal suspect and put him in prison, where he might receive visitors and legal advice. And his detention has emerged as a major obstacle to resolving the crisis, according to mediators. Brotherhood leaders and foreign diplomats have repeatedly pressed for Mr. Morsi\u2019s release as a good-will gesture that might move negotiations forward.         \n\nBesides meeting with Mr. Morsi, Ms. Ashton spoke with the interim president, Adli Mansour; his vice president, Mohamed ElBaradei; and the defense minister, Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi, as well as those Muslim Brotherhood leaders who have not been arrested. The meetings came as Egypt\u2019s new leaders widened their crackdown on the Islamists. The Ministry of Justice announced Tuesday that it was investigating judges and prosecutors suspected of ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, as part of an intensifying effort to remove the remnants of Mr. Morsi\u2019s leadership.         \n\nThe interest in Ms. Ashton\u2019s visit, which yielded no immediate breakthroughs except the news about Mr. Morsi, reflected the depth of Egypt\u2019s predicament, with the Brotherhood and the military both firmly refusing to yield.         \n\nMr. Morsi\u2019s supporters cautiously welcomed a bit of news about the ousted leader\u2019s well-being, but said the choice of visitors deepened their conviction that the military rulers were more concerned with stanching criticism overseas than reconciling with the Islamists.         \n\n\u201cWith all due respect to Ms. Ashton, it\u2019s a shame that the first person to see him is a foreigner,\u201d said Amr Darrag, a senior leader in the Brotherhood\u2019s political wing, the Freedom and Justice Party. \u201cAll these Egyptians are not allowed to see him, or even talk to him on the phone. They care about their international image, much more than their own people.\u201d         \n\nAnother Brotherhood leader said the group had received word that another delegation would be allowed to visit him soon, but it was also made up of foreigners.
