{"headline": "In Queens, a Casino Bet Gone Bad", "body": "\nOn a recent Saturday afternoon I set out to explore South Ozone Park in Queens, in particular a stretch whose racial composition \u2014 according to recent census data, about a quarter white, a quarter Asian, 10 percent black and 11 percent biracial, with 30 percent of residents belonging to the statistical category of \u201cother\u201d \u2014 makes it one of the three most diverse patches of the city. Ethnically, too, it contains multitudes: Dominicans and Puerto Ricans live alongside Ecuadoreans, Indians, Pakistanis, Chinese and people who look as though they might be cast in the production of anything succumbing to Italian-American caricature.         \n\nWhat had prompted my visit was, in a sense, a tourist\u2019s curiosity about how integration of this kind might actually be lived and how, in the midst of a mayoral race, political conceptions in such a place might be evolving.         \n\nThere were instances of inspiration to be found, encounters with a New York of one\u2019s gorgeous mosaic fantasies. A barbershop called E Place, owned by an Uzbek immigrant named Eric Dzhuray, caters to Trinidadians and Guyanese \u2014 who make up a considerable share of the community in South Ozone Park \u2014 and at least one young white suburbanite who had grown so devoted to the shop when he lived in neighboring Howard Beach that he continued his patronage even though he had married and moved to Long Island.         \n\nThe fact that a catering hall called La Bella Vita, owned by a man named Tony Modica and steeped in Pompeii aesthetics, was full of black patrons on the day I wandered in suggested that a certain kind of social progress had been made since the divisive days of Spike Lee\u2019s \u201c \n,\u201d two decades ago.         \n\nBoth the barbershop and catering hall were to be found on Rockaway Boulevard, the primary commercial thoroughfare in South Ozone Park. Though it seemed as if it should be a busy place, full of pedestrian traffic and businesses servicing varied cultural interests, it has the bloodless feel of a Sun Belt village lost to misbegotten visions. The area itself is not poor; in the particular census tract I was visiting, median family income stands at $63,000 a year, above the figure for the city on the whole. But whatever vitality the demographics might suggest is so obviously lacking that one longtime resident mentioned that he hoped simply for a McDonald\u2019s to energize the slackened mood.         \n\nHow could this have happened? When the subject of politics came up, it elicited little interest (except from a man named Danny Napoli, who wore dark glasses and a flag bandanna around his head and said that he was supporting Christine Quinn, offering that it didn\u2019t matter to him that she was gay). Few others seemed to have much sense of who was running for mayor at all or much faith that government could effect significant change \u2014 or at least significant good \u2014 locally.         \n\nSomething unfortunate had happened in the neighborhood, and now there seemed to be no turning back, people said: the opening nearly two years ago of  \n on Rockaway Boulevard, adjacent to the Aqueduct Racetrack. As Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo pushes for the authorization of  \n in upstate New York, and as the possibility of  \n looms in the years ahead, there are certainly lessons to be absorbed from what Resorts World has wrought.         \n\nAs Alberto Livecchi, a longtime resident of South Ozone Park and the owner of a store selling musical equipment, explained, the construction of the casino \u2014 a racino, in gambling parlance \u2014 came with promises that have not materialized. Having been sold as a boon to local commerce, it has instead affected businesses negatively, Mr. Livecchi argued. \u201cPeople are just funneled into the casino and don\u2019t leave,\u201d he remarked. Whatever street life there was has been destroyed, residents said; pawnshops are ubiquitous. \u201cCasinos are only interested in enriching themselves,\u201d Mr. Modica said.         \n\nAmple data on how gambling affects local businesses suggests that these men are not hallucinating. In the 1990s, researchers at Iowa State University examined the  \n for business owners in Clinton, Iowa, and found that while 12 percent reported an increase in business, 29 percent reported a decrease, and 60 percent reported no change at all. And racetrack casinos, as Clyde Barrow, a political economist who studies gambling, explained, draw most customers not from the far and wide but from a 30-minute radius. Rather than drawing new money to the area, it seems, they divert local dollars to gambling.         \n\nWhat we hardly need research to tell us is that the world that emerges around casinos is often an intensely depressing place. Across the street from Resorts World is Sell and Pawn Inc., which takes gold, silver, jewelry, electronics and so on from those compelled to find their way to their next slot machine dollar. The shop\u2019s owner, a Russian immigrant, opened up a year after the casino did, having worked in construction and seeing that work dry up after the financial crisis. A friend urged him to open a pawnshop because it was lucrative, but he was not, it seemed, prepared for the psychological toll this new occupation would take, for the fact that moral bankruptcy was now a job requirement.         \n\n\u201cYou have to take advantage of desperate people,\u201d he told me, looking fairly miserable. \u201cI don\u2019t like this business at all.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/16/nyregion/in-queens-a-casino-bet-gone-bad.html", "date": "2013-06-15", "description": "A recent Saturday afternoon visit prompted by curiosity revealed lessons on how the opening nearly two years ago of Resorts World Casino changed a community."}
