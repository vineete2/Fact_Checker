{"headline": "Obama Tests Limits of Power in Syrian Conflict", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In asking Congress to authorize an attack on Syria over claims it used chemical weapons, President Obama has chosen to involve lawmakers in deciding whether to undertake a military intervention that in some respects resembles the limited types that many presidents \u2014 Ronald Reagan in Grenada, Bill Clinton in Kosovo and even Mr. Obama in Libya \u2014 have launched on their own.         \n\nOn another level, the proposed strike is unlike anything that has come before \u2014 an attack inside the territory of a sovereign country, without its consent, without a self-defense rationale and without the authorization of the United Nations Security Council or even the participation of a multilateral treaty alliance like NATO, and for the purpose of punishing an alleged war crime that has already occurred rather than preventing an imminent disaster.         \n\nThe contrasting moves, ceding more of a political role to Congress domestically while expanding national war powers on the international stage, underscore the complexity of Mr. Obama\u2019s approach to the Syrian crisis. His administration pressed its case on Sunday, saying it had won Saudi backing for a strike, even as the Syrian president warned he would retaliate.         \n\nMr. Obama\u2019s strategy ensures that no matter what happens, the crisis is likely to create an important precedent in the often murky legal question of when presidents or nations may lawfully use military force.         \n\nKathryn Ruemmler, the White House counsel, said the president believed a strike would be lawful, both in international law and domestic law, even if neither the Security Council nor Congress approved it. But the novel circumstances, she said, led Mr. Obama to seek Congressional concurrence to bolster its legitimacy.         \n\nThe move is right, said Walter Dellinger, who led the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel in the Clinton administration, because the proposed attack is not \u201ccovered by any of the previous precedents for the unilateral use of executive power.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean it couldn\u2019t become another precedent,\u201d Mr. Dellinger added. \u201cBut when the president is going beyond where any previous president has gone, it seems appropriate to determine whether Congress concurs.\u201d         \n\nDisputes about whether and when a president or nation may launch an act of war can be hazy because courts generally do not issue definitive answers about such matters. Instead presidents, and countries, create precedents that over time can become generally accepted as a gloss on what written domestic laws and international treaties permit. Against that backdrop, many legal scholars say Mr. Obama is proposing to violate international law. But others contend that the question is ambiguous, and some suggest that the United States could establish a precedent creating new international law if it strikes.         \n\nThe United States has used its armed forces abroad  \n without Security Council approval, but typically has invoked self-defense; when Mr. Reagan invaded Grenada in 1983, for example, he cited a need to protect Americans on the island along with the request of neighboring countries. The most notable precedent for the Syria crisis was Mr. Clinton\u2019s 1999 bombing of Kosovo, but that was undertaken as part of NATO and in response to a time-urgent problem: stopping a massacre of civilians.         \n\nBy contrast, the United States would carry out strikes on Syria largely alone, and to punish an offense that has already occurred. That crime, moreover, is defined by  \n  \n banning chemical weapons, only one of which  \n, that contain no enforcement provisions. Such a strike has never happened before.         \n\nAttempts to deal with the novelty of the crisis in international law have become entangled in the separate domestic law question of whether the president could order strikes on Syria without Congressional permission.         \n\nSeeking the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination, Mr. Obama embraced a limited view of a president\u2019s power to initiate war without Congress, telling  \n that \u201cthe president does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation.\u201d         \n\nBut by the 2011 conflict in Libya he abandoned his campaign view of presidential war powers as too limited. While the NATO intervention was authorized for international law purposes by the Security Council, in domestic law Congress did not authorize Mr. Obama to participate. But Mr. Obama\u2019s  \n that it was lawful for him to unilaterally order American forces to bomb Libya because of national interests in preserving regional stability and in supporting the \u201ccredibility and effectiveness\u201d of the Security Council.
