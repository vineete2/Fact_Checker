{"headline": "A Quest to Make Gruff Service in France More Gracious", "body": "\nPARIS \u2014 On a recent afternoon near the  \n, Alberto Riberio, a tourist from Spain, stopped with his family at a quaint cafe and asked a waiter if they could sit down. \u201cLook around!\u201d he recalled the waiter replying abruptly. \u201cYou see empty tables, don\u2019t you?\u201d         \n\nWhen the family tried to order food in halting French, the waiter rolled his eyes, Mr. Riberio said. Later, when a wrong dish was served, an argument ensued over whether it would be changed.         \n\n\u201cIn general, the French can be quite friendly and helpful,\u201d said Mr. Riberio, whose family went on to have a pleasant stay. But the encounter \u201cwas a reminder of why they can also have a reputation for being rude,\u201d he said.         \n\nIn the City of Light, an eternal question is once again spurring debate: Is the stereotype of the brusque Frenchman justified, or do visitors just not understand the French?         \n\nThe soul-searching is coming from an unlikely place: the Paris tourism board. It is ramping up a charm offensive to burnish the image of France \u2014 and Paris in particular \u2014 as a kinder place for tourists. Officials have been deluging cafes, hotels, shops and taxi ranks with 20,000 more  \n titled \u201cDo You Speak Touriste?\u201d, a manual on how to make travelers feel more welcome, after 35,000 copies handed out in July ran out.         \n\nThe British, it advises, want to be called by their first names. The Japanese need to feel reassured. The Spanish mainly want people to be nice. (\u201cI would agree with that,\u201d Mr. Riberio said.) As for Americans, the guide notes, they are glued to their personal devices and want to eat as early as 6 p.m. \u2014 a frightful thought to a typical Parisien.         \n\n\u201cThe goal is to fight against a bad reputation, and improve the quality of the welcome in Paris,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Navarro, the communication director for the tourism board, the Comit\u00e9 R\u00e9gional du Tourisme Paris \u00cele-de-France. With 30 million tourists a year, Paris is one of the most visited cities in the world, he said. \u201cBut we can do more.\u201d         \n\nHow much more remains to be seen. Paul Kappe, an owner of the renowned  \n de l\u2019Isle Saint-Louis, perched behind the Cathedral of Notre-Dame, gave a Gallic shrug when he saw the brochure.         \n\n\u201cIt starts with the assumption that the French are disagreeable,\u201d said Mr. Kappe, a contemplative man who kept a watchful eye on the restaurant\u2019s sunny terrace, full of waiters and patrons crammed behind tiny tables. \u201cWell, that does have the ring of truth,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it won\u2019t stop a waiter from being unpleasant.\u201d         \n\nHe added, \u201cTheir mentality is, \u2018Don\u2019t bother me when I\u2019m working.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nThe campaign holds special importance as France begins to overcome an economic malaise that has deepened a sense of moroseness in the country. This month, the French federation of hotels and restaurants reported a 10 percent fall in tourism this year compared with a year ago.         \n\nPerhaps more challenging is the growing competition that Paris faces, not only from rivals like London, New York and Barcelona, but also from upstart tourist destinations in the Asia-Pacific region. Last year, more than 20 percent of the world\u2019s vacationers visited an Asian city; the region earned $324 billion in international tourism receipts \u2014 a full 30 percent of the global total, according to a United Nations World Tourism Organization report. By contrast, the United States earned $126 billion from tourism, while France earned $54 billion, less than China and Spain, the report said.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge economic battle going on between the world\u2019s tourism capitals,\u201d Mr. Navarro said. Just 15 years ago, he said, there were about 60 major destinations; today, there are about 600. \u201cIf we don\u2019t improve our service, we will lose money.\u201d         \n\nBut is the effort really necessary? After all, countless visitors leave the French capital enchanted by their experience, having never lived the legend of snooty service.         \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t think of any time when I\u2019ve been treated rudely,\u201d said Paul Sanger, 74, an Atlanta native who said he had visited Paris more than 100 times over five decades. \u201cA lot of Americans think the French are being rude because they can\u2019t understand them. But a lot of it is a cultural thing.\u201d         \n\nTo many foreigners, Paris is easier to navigate than ever. Today, English has become the new French for an army of young Parisien waiters who switch between the languages with ease, and even pride, when they hear a foreign accent. And many of the 600,000 Parisiens employed in the tourism industry place a premium on politesse.         \n\nStill, \u201csnobisme\u201d is hardly a relic of the past, and even the French complain about a perceived lack of civility among some of their big-city brethren. A spate of mocking television ads by the newspaper Le Parisien a few years ago, showing Parisiens  \n and leaving poodle droppings  \n, provoked knowing laughs. And this is by no means the first time the government has encouraged a more polished image: in 1995, a \u201cBonjour\u201d campaign urged people to be pleasant to tourists, echoing several similar efforts since World War II.         \n\nOf course, tourists can be uncouth, too. \u201cA lot of Americans shout, or don\u2019t say hello, and then they say the French treated them rudely,\u201d said Karen Fawcett, the president of  \n, a Web site that dispenses travel and cultural insights. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have some cultural sensitivity, you are probably not going to be well received.\u201d         \n\nMs. Fawcett said her main tips for visitors were to be polite, keep their voices down and not assume they will be served immediately. \u201cA simple \u2018bonjour\u2019 or a \u2018s\u2019il vous pla\u00eet\u2019 will go a long way,\u201d she said.         \n\nMr. Kappe at the Brasserie de l\u2019Isle Saint-Louis said waiters appreciated engaging with clients. But he scoffed at a recommendation in the pamphlet that waiters show more warmth by using their first name with Americans. \u201cThat\u2019s just not done,\u201d he said.         \n\nAll of the brasserie\u2019s servers were longtime professionals, dressed impeccably in white shirts and long black aprons. Their smiles were hardly effusive, but they poured wine with an expert turn of the wrist and counseled diners on the \u201cplat du jour.\u201d On the other hand, some deftly ignored patrons clamoring for a bill.         \n\n\u201cIn the United States,\u201d Mr. Kappe observed, \u201cwaiters can be fired at any time and must work for tips, so they have to be nice. In France, you can\u2019t just fire somebody if they\u2019re not doing a good job. If you could, everyone would be friendly.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/21/world/europe/can-the-gruff-frenchman-become-the-gracious-frenchman.html", "date": "2013-08-20", "description": "An effort is under way to make France, and Paris in particular, a kinder place for tourists."}
