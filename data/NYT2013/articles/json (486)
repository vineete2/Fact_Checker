When they get back to the base, the military will now recognize their marriage, affording them a variety of benefits that would go to any married couple, like health care and a housing allowance.         \n\nBut once they exit Keesler\u2019s gates, they will find their marriage license means nothing to the state of Mississippi, where same-sex couples cannot adopt children and employers can fire someone who is gay.         \n\nWhat about the case of a gay couple who married in Des Moines but decide to move to Miami to spend their retirement away from the punishing Iowa winters? If one of them dies there, the other may not be able to collect the surviving spouse\u2019s Social Security benefits.         \n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision on Wednesday, in United States v. Windsor, to declare that the Defense of Marriage Act violated the Constitution went further than the federal government ever has in extending equal rights to same-sex couples. But it left untouched the thicket of conflicting state and local laws that deny gays and lesbians in the vast majority of states the benefits and legal recognition that marriage provides.         \n\nA state line \u2014 not a minister, a rabbi or a justice of the peace \u2014 still decides who is married and who is not. This disparate treatment under the law is likely to remain unless the 37 states that do not permit same-sex unions reverse course, or if the Supreme Court revisits the question in a broader case and issues a ruling that establishes a constitutional right to marriage. Given the court\u2019s decision in a case involving California\u2019s Proposition 8 on Wednesday, the number of states where gay marriage is legal rose to 13.         \n\nEven as gay rights advocates celebrated a historic step forward on Wednesday, many of them were already eyeing the next legal frontier that could deliver the universal recognition of marriage rights that eluded them this time.         \n\n\u201cLiving in this kind of patchwork country is becoming less and less tenable,\u201d said Susan Sommer, the director of constitutional litigation for Lambda Legal, the gay rights group. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to have federal benefits and recognition, it certainly makes a state\u2019s withholding of the freedom to marry come with that much greater a cost \u2014 an impairment of liberty.\u201d         \n\nEven factoring out the conflicts and inequities that remain in state law, federal law and policy will need an overhaul to accommodate the court\u2019s Windsor decision.         \n\nDespite its historic sweep, the court\u2019s ruling came with a large question mark: It may require Congress to make some of the legal changes necessary to ensure that all married same-sex couples can receive the benefits of federal programs like Social Security and veterans\u2019 payments.         \n\nPresident Obama said Wednesday that he had directed the attorney general to conduct a prompt review of federal benefits and obligations to ensure that the decision is \u201cimplemented swiftly and smoothly.\u201d The White House has told gay rights advocates that it has already started looking into what changes it might be able to make through administrative and executive orders, steps that would not require Congressional approval. The Justice Department has created a special task force for the job.         \n\nThe Democrat-controlled Senate is expected to act quickly on legislation introduced by Dianne Feinstein of California on Wednesday that would ensure same-sex couples are not excluded from federal benefits even if they live in states where their marriages are not recognized. But without the Republican-led House\u2019s approval, any such measure could not become law.         \n\nThe confusion arises from the various ways the government considers eligibility for spousal benefits. Different agencies use different criteria in judging whether a marriage is valid. They could, for instance, consider the marriage valid only if the state where the couple currently live recognizes it. Or they could look to the state where the couple filed their most recent tax return, or where they lived when they applied for benefits, or where they were married.
