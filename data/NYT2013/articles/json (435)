{"headline": "Obama Outlines Ambitious Plan to Cut Greenhouse Gases", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama, declaring that \u201cAmericans across the country are already paying the price of inaction,\u201d announced sweeping measures on Tuesday to reduce greenhouse gas pollution and prepare the nation for a future of rising temperatures.         \n\nEmbracing wholeheartedly an issue that could define his legacy but is sure to ignite new political battles with Republicans, Mr. Obama said he would use his executive powers to require reductions in the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by the nation\u2019s power plants.         \n\nThe carbon cuts at power plants are the centerpiece of a three-pronged climate-change plan that will also involve new federal funds to advance renewable energy technology, as well as spending to fortify cities and states against the ravages of storms and droughts aggravated by a changing climate.         \n\nMr. Obama waded more deeply than he has before into the dispute over the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, which would carry heavy crude oil from Alberta to depots and refineries in the Midwest and on the Gulf Coast. He said he would not approve the 1,700-mile pipeline if it was shown that it would \u201csignificantly\u201d worsen climate change.         \n\nThe president\u2019s comments were ambiguous: He did not specify what aspects of the project he was including or what level of climate impact he considers \u201csignificant.\u201d Opponents and backers of the pipeline found support for their positions in his remarks.         \n\nOn the broader climate challenge, however, Mr. Obama was unequivocal. Saying that science had put to rest the debate over whether human activity was responsible for warming the earth, he told an audience at Georgetown University, \u201cThe question now is whether we will have the courage to act before it is too late.\u201d         \n\n\u201cAs a president, as a father and as an American, I am here to say, we need to act,\u201d Mr. Obama said to students and others gathered in a sunbaked quadrangle, mopping his brow with a handkerchief, as if to dramatize his point. \u201cI refuse to condemn your generation and future generations to a planet that\u2019s beyond fixing.\u201d         \n\nIt was by far Mr. Obama\u2019s boldest attempt to grapple with one of the seminal challenges of the time. But it also starts a clock ticking, with the president aiming to draft and put into place a complicated set of rules in just two years, to meet his pledge of reducing the nation\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020.         \n\nWhile Mr. Obama dwelt on what he said was the less partisan nature of antipollution movements in the past, his reliance on executive branch regulations and other administrative actions, which do not require Congressional approval, is an acknowledgment that legislation to tackle climate change would be a near-impossibility in a deeply divided Congress.         \n\nRepublicans were quick to condemn the measures, saying they constituted a government overreach that would constrict energy production and strangle the nation\u2019s economic recovery.         \n\n\u201cThese policies, rejected even by the last Democratic-controlled Congress, will shutter power plants, destroy good-paying American jobs and raise electricity bills,\u201d the House speaker, John A. Boehner, said in a statement.         \n\nEven the timing of the speech ran into headwinds, coming in a week of major Supreme Court decisions, the drama over the travels of the National Security Agency leaker Edward J. Snowden and a debate in Congress over immigration reform.         \n\nWhite House aides said they had long planned for Mr. Obama to deliver the speech before July 4 and that it was important to announce the measures as early as possible because of the length of time needed for the Environmental Protection Agency to finalize the regulations.         \n\nBut the president\u2019s broader proposals were somewhat overshadowed by his reference to Keystone. Mr. Boehner\u2019s spokesman, Brendan Buck, said, \u201cThe standard the president set today should lead to speedy approval of the Keystone pipeline.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/us/politics/obama-plan-to-cut-greenhouse-gases.html", "date": "2013-06-25", "description": "President Obama proposed far-reaching regulations on power plants and energy efficiency, using executive actions that will not need Congressional approval."}
