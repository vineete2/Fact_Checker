{"headline": "Path to United States Practice Is Long Slog to Foreign Doctors", "body": "\nThousands of foreign-trained immigrant physicians are living in the United States with lifesaving skills that are going unused because they stumbled over one of the many hurdles in the path toward becoming a licensed doctor here.         \n\nThe involved testing process and often duplicative training these doctors must go through are intended to make sure they meet this country\u2019s high quality standards, which American medical industry groups say are unmatched elsewhere in the world. Some development experts are also loath to make it too easy for foreign doctors to practice here because of the risk of a \u201cbrain drain\u201d abroad.         \n\nBut many foreign physicians and their advocates argue that the process is unnecessarily restrictive and time-consuming, particularly since America\u2019s need for doctors will expand sharply in a few short months under President Obama\u2019s health care law. They point out that medical services cost far more in the United States than elsewhere in the world, in part because of such restrictions.         \n\nThe United States already faces a shortage of physicians in many parts of the country, especially in specialties where foreign-trained physicians are most likely to practice, like primary care. And that shortage is  \n when the health care law insures millions more Americans starting in 2014.         \n\nThe new health care law only modestly increases the supply of homegrown primary care doctors, not nearly enough to account for the shortfall, and even that tiny bump is still a few years away because it takes so long to train new doctors. Immigrant advocates and some economists point out that the medical labor force could grow much faster if the country tapped the underused skills of the foreign-trained physicians who are already here but are not allowed to practice. Canada, by contrast, has made efforts to recognize more high-quality training programs done abroad.         \n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t cost the taxpayers a penny because these doctors come fully trained,\u201d said Nyapati Raghu Rao, the Indian-born chairman of psychiatry at Nassau University Medical Center and a past chairman of the American Medical Association\u2019s international medical graduates governing council. \u201cIt is doubtful that the U.S. can respond to the massive shortages without the participation of international medical graduates. But we\u2019re basically ignoring them in this discussion and I don\u2019t know why that is.\u201d         \n\nConsider Sajith Abeyawickrama, 37, who was a celebrated anesthesiologist in his native Sri Lanka. But here in the United States, where he came in 2010 to marry, he cannot practice medicine.         \n\nInstead of working as a doctor himself, he has held a series of jobs in the medical industry, including an unpaid position where he entered patient data into a hospital\u2019s electronic medical records system, and, more recently, a paid position teaching a test prep course for students trying to become licensed doctors themselves.         \n\nFor years the United States has been training too few doctors to meet its own needs, in part because of industry-set limits on the number of medical school slots available. Today about one in four physicians practicing in the United States were trained abroad, a figure that includes a substantial number of American citizens who could not get into medical school at home and studied in places like the Caribbean.         \n\nBut immigrant doctors, no matter how experienced and well trained, must run a long, costly and confusing gantlet before they can actually practice here.         \n\nThe process usually starts with an application to a  \n that verifies medical school transcripts and diplomas. Among  \n, foreign doctors must prove they  \n; pass three separate steps of the  \n; get American recommendation letters, usually obtained after volunteering or working in a hospital, clinic or research organization; and be permanent residents or receive a work visa (which often requires them to return to their home country after their training).         \n\nThe biggest challenge is that an immigrant physician must win one of the coveted slots in America\u2019s medical residency system, the step that seems to be the tightest bottleneck.         \n\nThat residency, which typically involves grueling 80-hour workweeks, is required even if a doctor previously did a residency in a country with an advanced medical system, like Britain or Japan. The only exception is for doctors who did their residencies in Canada.         \n\nThe whole process can consume upward of a decade \u2014 for those lucky few who make it through.
