{"headline": "More Friction Between Yankees and Rodriguez", "body": "\nBOSTON \u2014 Feeling betrayed and disappointed by his star player,  \n General Manager  \n sat in the visitors\u2019 dugout at Fenway Park on Sunday, calling  \n a liar and saying he no longer trusted Rodriguez enough to discuss any substantive matters with him. Yet when Rodriguez is in the batter\u2019s box, Cashman roots hard for him to succeed.         \n\n\u201cThese are unique times,\u201d Cashman said.         \n\nIndeed they are. While Yankees officials fumed Saturday night over  \n to a New York Times reporter, Rodriguez had dinner at the home of David Ortiz, the popular Red Sox slugger.         \n\nAlmost daily, a new development arises in the drama surrounding Rodriguez, with the player and his team having reached an astonishing level of antagonism. Cashman said in his 16 years as general manager of the Yankees, he had never seen anything like it.         \n\nIn the latest development, Rodriguez and his camp are planning to file a formal grievance against the Yankees over their handling of his medical problems. If a grievance is filed, it will follow the declaration by the Yankees\u2019 president, Randy Levine, on Sunday that Rodriguez \u201cput up or shut up.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s going to file a grievance, that\u2019s great,\u201d Levine said before the Yankees\u2019 emotional 9-6 win over the Boston Red Sox. \u201cThat will finally put all the medical issues to rest. And if he is willing, we will be happy to release all his medical records to the public.\u201d         \n\nRodriguez did not comment before the Yankees\u2019 game, but he said he would address the issue afterward.         \n\nA lawyer for Rodriguez, Joseph Tacopina, said in an interview with The Times first published online Saturday that the Yankees withheld information from Rodriguez during the playoffs last season that his hip was injured. It was one of several accusations directed against the Yankees and Major League Baseball.         \n\nThe Yankees think Rodriguez and his legal team are attacking them over the medical issues as a ploy to distract people from the 211-game suspension he was issued for his suspected connection to the now-defunct clinic Biogenesis. Rodriguez is appealing the penalty.         \n\n\u201cAlex and his team will apparently say anything to divert attention from the real issue of did he or did he not use P.E.D.\u2019s,\u201d Levine said, referring to performance-enhancing drugs. \u201cThey said I would receive a commission if I got the team out from under his contract. That\u2019s not true. They said we fined him $150,000. That\u2019s not true. They said we didn\u2019t give him the best medical care. That\u2019s not true.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really sad that we\u2019re in Boston in the middle of a pennant race in crucial games and this is what this organization has to deal with. It\u2019s about time he lived up to his commitments to his teammates and the organization.\u201d         \n\nTacopina also charged that Dr. Bryan Kelly, who operated on Rodriguez\u2019s hip earlier this year, told Rodriguez that Levine said he did not want Rodriguez ever to take the field again. Kelly\u2019s lawyer would not confirm the allegation, but Cashman said he was on every conference call with Kelly and Levine regarding Rodriguez\u2019s hip and said no one ever told Kelly such a thing.         \n\nCashman called the situation, which has accelerated into new territory the past few weeks, a distraction to the team. But he said the players and Manager Joe Girardi had done a good job of tuning it out. In fact, when Rodriguez was hit by a pitch from Ryan Dempster on Sunday, Girardi came flying out of the dugout to Rodriguez\u2019s defense and was ejected. Several Yankees spilled onto the field, and the bullpens emptied, suggesting that on some level Rodriguez\u2019s teammates still backed him.         \n\n\u201cIf it were something on the field, like he wasn\u2019t hustling or something, then maybe it would bother guys,\u201d Lyle Overbay said before the game. \u201cBut it\u2019s not a distraction to us. I don\u2019t even think it\u2019s a distraction to him.\u201d         \n\nPhil Hughes said the matter did not even come up in regular conversation. \u201cPlayers are so regimented with their routines and the things we have to do to prepare for a game, we don\u2019t even think about it,\u201d he said.         \n\nBut Cashman said it had been a distraction to him because of the work that he had had to put in to deal with it. He mentioned how many times he had defended Rodriguez in public and seemed hurt Rodriguez would choose to make such defamatory charges against him and the Yankees.         \n\n\u201cListen, none of this stuff is productive,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing involved with Biogenesis isn\u2019t productive. The allegations, at least, of being involved with Biogenesis. None of this stuff is productive.\u201d         \n\nCashman also outlined what he said were contradictory comments by Rodriguez regarding his medical situation and said that Rodriguez had lied to him.         \n\nWhen Rodriguez had a quadriceps injury last month, he told Cashman on the phone he did not have a problem with the team\u2019s medical staff, Cashman said. A few days later, Rodriguez had a doctor go on the radio to contradict the Yankees\u2019 diagnosis.         \n\nCashman said that at the time, he felt like Katie Couric, who interviewed Rodriguez on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in 2007, when he denied using P.E.D.\u2019s. Two years later, he acknowledged using them during his time with the Texas Rangers.         \n\n\u201cI know at that moment of time I was lied to,\u201d Cashman said.         \n\nThe last conversation between Cashman and Rodriguez was Friday in the team hotel, Cashman said. Cashman said he merely said hello; there was no discussion of the suspension, no dispute about the medical issues or any of the public confrontations that have come up in recent weeks.         \n\nCashman called the current atmosphere \u201clitigious\u201d and said he was afraid that something he said to Rodriguez could be used against him in a legal proceeding.         \n\n\u201cA hello, goodbye, and that\u2019s it,\u201d Cashman said, \u201cbecause anything else, I don\u2019t want to be distorted, to be quite honest.\u201d         \n\nYet, as general manager of a team in the playoff chase, he still hopes Rodriguez will hit home runs. On that front, Rodriguez came through on Sunday, hitting a leadoff drive in the sixth.
