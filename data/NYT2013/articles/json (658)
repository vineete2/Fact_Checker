{"headline": "No Quick Impact in U.S. Arms Plan for Syria Rebels", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A month ago Obama administration officials promised to deliver arms and ammunition to the Syrian rebels in the hope of reversing the tide of a war that had turned against an embattled opposition.         \n\nBut interviews with American, Western and Middle Eastern officials show that the administration\u2019s plans are far more limited than it has indicated in public and private.         \n\nIn fact, the officials said, the administration\u2019s plans to use the  \n to covertly train and arm the rebels could take months to have any impact on a chaotic battlefield. Many officials believe the assistance is unlikely to bolster the rebellion enough to push President  \n of  \n to the negotiating table.         \n\nThe plans call for the C.I.A. to supply only small arms, and to only a limited segment of the opposition \u2014 the actual numbers are unclear. In addition, much of the training, which is to take place over months in Jordan and Turkey, has not yet started, partly because of Congressional objections.         \n\nThe cautious approach reflects the continued ambivalence and internal divisions of an administration that still has little appetite for intervention in Syria, but has been backed into a corner after American and European spy agencies concluded that Syrian government troops had used chemical weapons against the rebels. Mr. Obama had declared the use of chemical weapons to be a \u201cred line\u201d leading to American action.         \n\nMany in the administration say they are still seeking to satisfy themselves that they have taken all precautions possible to prevent weapons from falling into the hands of Islamic extremists in Syria. To them, the plan carries echoes of previous American efforts to arm rebels in Angola, Nicaragua and elsewhere, many of which backfired. There is also fear at the White House that Mr. Obama will be dragged into another war in the Middle East.         \n\nBut others, particularly many in the State Department, argue that the United States must intervene to prevent a further deterioration of security in the region and to stop a humanitarian crisis that is spiraling out of control, officials said.         \n\n\u201cIn my meetings with American policy makers I often detect a conversation between ghosts,\u201d said Michael Oren, the Israeli ambassador in Washington, speaking of the debate. \u201cThe ghosts of Afghanistan and Iraq are vying with the ghosts of Rwanda and Kosovo.\u201d         \n\nThe plan \u2014 made possible after Mr. Obama signed a secret \u201cfinding\u201d that circumvents international laws prohibiting lethal support to groups trying to overthrow a sitting government \u2014 continues to face bipartisan skepticism in Congress.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not clear to me that the administration has a workable policy,\u201d Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican on the Intelligence Committee, said last week.         \n\nSenior officials, including Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and the C.I.A. director, John O. Brennan, have lobbied lawmakers in closed briefings and personal phone calls since late June. On Sunday, a senior administration official said that the Congressional concerns had been addressed and that \u201cwe look forward to pressing forward.\u201d Some senior Congressional officials said Sunday that final details must still be worked out.         \n\nThe Congressional impasse has exposed other shortcomings in the administration\u2019s approach, lawmakers and independent Syria specialists said.         \n\nThe slow start to the arming effort has led to skepticism \u2014 particularly as Mr. Assad\u2019s troops retake strategically important towns from rebel forces \u2014 that the C.I.A.\u2019s plan can achieve what Mr. Obama has said is America\u2019s ultimate goal: forcing Mr. Assad to step down.         \n\nWhite House officials have made few public statements about the expanded military support to the rebels. It was not the president but Benjamin J. Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, who announced the policy shift on June 13 in a conference call with reporters, saying that the approach \u201caimed at strengthening both the cohesion of the opposition, but also the effectiveness\u201d of the rebels.         \n\nAfter the announcement, one senior Arab official said the United States would act like a \u201cquarterback\u201d \u2014 coordinating not only American arms shipments but also expanded deliveries of weapons from other allies, and probably providing opposition groups with intelligence reports on the movements of Syrian government forces. For nearly two years, a fractious coalition of Muslim nations, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, has supplied the rebels with weapons. The countries have been eager for the United States to take a direct role in arming them.
