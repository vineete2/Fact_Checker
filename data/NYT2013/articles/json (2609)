{"headline": "U.S. Sets Roster for Two September World Cup Qualifiers", "body": "\nOnly a disaster of cataclysmic proportions can keep the United States from advancing to next summer\u2019s World Cup in Brazil. Still, there are four regional qualifying matches to be played between now and the end of October.         \n\nOn Thursday, United States Coach Jurgen Klinsmann, who is riding high on the strength of a record 12-match winning streak, announced his 23-man roster for the two games in September \u2014 at Costa Rica on Sept. 6 and against Mexico on Sept. 10.         \n\n\u201cThe Costa Rica game in San Jose is the biggest game in 2013 for all of us because we want to win there,\u201d  \n. \u201cWe want to get three points. We want to qualify as soon as possible for the World Cup in Brazil. We want to get the first-ever three points in World Cup qualifying in Costa Rica. It\u2019s going to be huge. We have to be extremely disciplined with eight or nine players being on yellow cards to prepare also for the game against Mexico in Columbus, so going into Costa Rica we really need to be on top of our game. We need to be very focused and sharp and make it happen.\u201d         \n\nPerhaps the most notable name on Klinsmann\u2019s list belongs to Landon Donovan, who is bidding to play his first qualifying match for the national team since June 2012. Donovan, who earlier this week signed a long-term contract with the Los Angeles Galaxy of Major League Soccer, had dropped off Klinsmann\u2019s radar after taking a sabbatical from soccer that carried into World Cup qualifying matches earlier this year. But Donovan turned in strong performances in the Concacaf Gold Cup this summer, which the United States won.         \n\nClint Dempsey, who has been named the official captain by Klinsmann, taking over from Carlos Bocanegra (2007-12) is set to make his 100th international appearance, but first since his transfer from Tottenham Hotspur to the Seattle Sounders of M.L.S. He leads the United States with seven goals in the current qualifying cycle.         \n\nEleven players named to the roster were part of the Gold Cup squad: DaMarcus Beasley, Kyle Beckerman, Alejandro Bedoya, Matt Besler, Edgar Castillo, Mix Diskerud, Donovan, Omar Gonzalez, Eddie Johnson, Michael Orozco and Nick Rimando.         \n\nKlinsmann also recalled two players \u2014 Aron Johannsson and John Brooks \u2014 who made their senior international debuts for the United States earlier this month in a friendly match at Bosnia-Herzegovina.         \n\nThe United States is in first place in the final found of qualifying, with 13 points from six matches. The U.S. could qualify for the World Cup after the Costa Rica match with a victory, a tie between Mexico and Honduras, and a Panama loss or tie against Jamaica.         \n\nEight American players \u2014 Jozy Altidore, Michael Bradley, Geoff Cameron, Brad Evans, Dempsey, Tim Howard, Fabian Johnson and Jermaine Jones \u2014 take yellow cards into the Costa Rica game, with the next caution for any of them meaning a one-game suspension.         \n\n \n:         \n\n \n Brad Guzan (Aston Villa/England), Tim Howard (Everton/England), Nick Rimando (Real Salt Lake/M.L.S.)         \n\n \n DaMarcus Beasley (Puebla/Mexico), Matt Besler (Sporting Kansas City/M.L.S.), John Brooks (Hertha Berlin/Germany), Geoff Cameron (Stoke City/England), Edgar Castillo (Tijuana/Mexico), Brad Evans (Seattle/M.L.S.), Omar Gonzalez (Los Angeles/M.L.S.), Michael Orozco (Puebla/Mexico)         \n\n \n Kyle Beckerman (Real Salt Lake/M.L.S.), Alejandro Bedoya (Nantes/France), Michael Bradley (Roma/Italy), Mix Diskerud (Rosenborg/Norway), Fabian Johnson (Hoffenheim/Germany), Jermaine Jones (Schalke/Germany), Graham Zusi (Sporting Kansas City/M.L.S.)         \n\n \n Jozy Altidore (Sunderland/England), Clint Dempsey (Seattle/M.L.S.), Landon Donovan (Los Angeles/M.L.S.), Aron Johannsson (AZ/the Netherlands), Eddie Johnson (Seattle/M.L.S.)         \n\n \n         \n\nThree other M.L.S. players have been called to their national teams for coming matches. The Red Bulls will lose midfielder  \n for a friendly between Australia and Brazil in Brasilia on Sept. 7. Defender  \n, who sustained an injury in last week\u2019s loss at Chivas USA, was recalled by Costa Rica. Philadelphia\u2019s  \n was called up by Sierra Leone for its home qualifier against Equatorial Guinea in Freetown on Sept. 7.
