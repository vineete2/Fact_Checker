{"headline": "The Opposite of Bloomberg? Not So Fast", "body": "\nOur billionaire mayor has seen his golden touch turn to dross of late, and so he decided that he would not bestow his endorsement on a successor.         \n\nIt was thought the mayor had just one target for his electoral affections: the Republican  \n.         \n\nBut if legacy weighed on Michael R. Bloomberg, he might have considered strolling over to the Beaux-Arts Manhattan Municipal Building, knocking on the public advocate\u2019s door and offering his endorsement to  \n.         \n\n\u201cNew York\u2019s progressive choice\u201d might well have slipped out the back door and clattered down the steps to avoid that meeting. Mr. de Blasio has taken great pains to frame himself as the anti-Bloomberg.         \n\nBut facts intrude.  \n\u2019s legacy is far more progressive than Mr. de Blasio and his supporters let on. And the mayor might one day find himself nodding in grudging admiration as a de Blasio administration works to deepen and extend some of his policies.         \n\nFrom affordable housing to public health to child welfare to the creation of park land to reworking the city\u2019s streetscape, Mr. Bloomberg has an impressive progressive policy legacy. He was a fierce guardian of our endangered watershed. On global warming, his proposed marshlands and natural barriers and tough but fair construction standards are a  \n.         \n\nPark lands edge the waterways, and innovative playgrounds are found opposite the Metropolitan Museum of Art \u2014 and at Public School 181, at 1023 New York Avenue in East Flatbush, and in the farthest reaches of Far Rockaway.         \n\nIn his first term, he raised taxes to protect services. He gave big raises to teachers. Whatever one makes of his education reforms (and I\u2019m often critical), he built grand new schools and tried to crack open a calcified system.         \n\nHe was less a Republican than a chameleon, changing affiliation from Democrat to Republican to independent as his electoral desires dictated.         \n\nMichael Gecan and the Industrial Areas Foundation, a coalition of congregations and neighborhoods, battled this administration. But they also worked with it to build a gleaming school in Mott Haven in the Bronx. And they built working-class homes in Brooklyn across Brownsville and East New York.         \n\n\u201cGeorge Bush doesn\u2019t do that. Or Rick Perry in Texas,\u201d Mr. Gecan noted. \u201cThose aren\u2019t the actions of a right-winger.\u201d         \n\nO.K. Now that I\u2019ve climbed so far out on this branch as to risk a tumble, let me inch back in. The mayor has been unyielding on  \n policing tactics, with their disproportionate effect on black and Latino males. A Mayor de Blasio would retain the tactic as a tool, but significant change looms.         \n\nCulturally, the mayor remains a man of Wall Street, which is to say a deep-dyed capitalist. He does not spend much time contemplating his contradictions. He favors some government interventions \u2014 outlawing smoking in bars and banning big urns of soda. But he talks as if others \u2014 a few sick days for a pharmacy cashier? a living wage for a hard-working janitor? \u2014 threaten the foundation of this city.         \n\nA Mayor de Blasio offers the possibilities of new paths walked. He might press in Albany to raise the minimum wage. Or he might reverse our conservancy-driven tale of rich park-poor park. Chicago and Seattle dedicate money for parks \u2014 are we so parochial as to think we have nothing to learn?         \n\nMr. de Blasio talks of pulling on zoning levers and pushing creatively to extend the city\u2019s reach on affordable housing. If he does so, he will lean heavily on the Bloomberg administration\u2019s creative financing programs.         \n\nNor is Mr. Lhota the wolf at the door of liberal fears. He is a New York Republican, which in national terms is awfully close to an irredeemable liberal. Recently, he claimed he could deliver a $500 million universal prekindergarten program without identifying where he would get the money. How very John V. Lindsay of him.         \n\nMr. Lhota and Mr. de Blasio, finally, might consider adopting a Bloomberg trait. When faced with complaints about his initiatives, Mr. Bloomberg had an admirable willingness to say: Feh.         \n\nWe\u2019ll talk to you, he suggested, but we won\u2019t stop forever if you disagree.         \n\nWould Mayor Lhota push business backers to swallow a higher minimum wage? Could Mayor de Blasio prevail upon the unions for real concessions?         \n\nThe other day, Mr. Bloomberg said he wanted only to offer his successor \u201ca world-class transition.\u201d What he might not realize is that even a liberal successor is likely to stand more in his shadow than either man might guess.
