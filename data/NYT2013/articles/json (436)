{"headline": "In Bulger\u2019s Underworld, a \u2018Judas Was the Worst\u2019", "body": "\nBOSTON \u2014 \u201cFamily and friends come first,\u201d John Martorano, an aging gangster known as the Executioner, declared from the witness stand here on Tuesday. \u201cMy father always taught me that. The priests and the nuns I grew up with taught me that. They taught me that Judas \u2014 Judas was the worst person in the world.\u201d         \n\nJust a few days into testimony at one of the most sensational criminal trials in this city\u2019s history, it is clear that something more is at stake than the racketeering and murder charges in the 32-count indictment against  \n, the notorious ruler of Boston\u2019s underworld in the 1970s and \u201980s.         \n\nThe trial has focused in its early days on the criminals\u2019 concepts of honor and loyalty, codes they say they lived by.         \n\nMr. Martorano, for one, who has confessed to at least 20 murders, took offense at being called a \u201cmass murderer,\u201d did not like the term \u201chit man\u201d and rejected the label \u201cserial killer.\u201d         \n\nHe preferred the term \u201cvigilante,\u201d seeing in it the noble pursuit of protecting friends and family, especially if they were being hurt or double-crossed or could be hurt or double-crossed.         \n\n\u201cIs there any honor or integrity in what you did?\u201d Mr. Martorano was asked under relentless cross-examination on Tuesday by Henry Brennan, a defense lawyer.         \n\n\u201cI thought so,\u201d Mr. Martorano replied. \u201cI thought both. I didn\u2019t like risking my life, but I thought if the reason was right, I\u2019d try.\u201d         \n\nThat concept of honor has been a subtext of this trial since the moment it opened last week. Mr. Bulger\u2019s lead lawyer, J. W. Carney Jr., took the unusual tack of immediately acknowledging that his client was guilty of several charges against him, including drug dealing, illegal bookmaking and loansharking, and said he had made \u201cmillions upon millions\u201d of dollars through his criminal enterprises.         \n\nBut, the lawyer insisted, Mr. Bulger, 83, was never an  \n informer, as the prosecution alleges. Nor, he said, did Mr. Bulger kill the two women on the list of 19 murders he is accused of participating in.         \n\nThe code prohibits the killing of women. And being an informer is totally unacceptable \u2014 something that Mr. Carney said was deeply ingrained in the Irish, who for so long had to protect one another from their British overlords.         \n\n\u201cThe worst thing that an Irish person could consider doing was becoming an informant because of the history of the Troubles in Ireland,\u201d he told the jury in his opening statement.         \n\nMr. Martorano, 72, who told the court that he had regarded Mr. Bulger as a brother, is now testifying for the prosecution against him because, he said, he found out belatedly, after decades as partners in crime, that Mr. Bulger had violated that code and was an F.B.I. informer all along. (He was testifying under a deal that let him off with a 14-year sentence for his 20 confessed murders.)         \n\nSome legal observers of the trial have quickly concluded that the show going on in the federal courthouse is an exercise in self-delusion, all for the purpose of allowing Mr. Bulger \u2014 who sought the trial when he pleaded not guilty to all charges against him \u2014 to profess to the world that he abided by his personal code.         \n\n\u201cThey all have their own codes, and they betray those codes if they need to,\u201d said Michael D. Kendall, a former federal prosecutor who investigated some aspects of Mr. Bulger\u2019s activities. \u201cThey kill their friends, they kill their girlfriends, they want to make themselves sound better than they are. Whitey\u2019s code is, \u2018I didn\u2019t strangle the woman, I watched the other guy strangle the woman.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nThe trial has gripped Boston, attracting scores of reporters from far and wide and earning prominent daily coverage in the newspapers, online and on the local news. Part of the fascination is with a world gone by, not only the old gritty streets of South Boston but the world before cellphones and e-mail became standard forms of communication.         \n\nIn the world unfolding at the courthouse, a parade of aging gangsters describe speaking into walkie-talkies. They used phone booths. They hid astounding amounts of cash inside walls. They shipped arms across country by checking them on an ordinary passenger bus.         \n\nThis world was marked by gangland slayings that now seem pass\u00e9. At the center was the code that they now use to justify their actions.         \n\n\u201cBulger is the creator of that cult of the code,\u201d said Anthony Cardinale, a criminal defense lawyer who has represented mobsters and who first exposed Mr. Bulger as an informer.         \n\n\u201cThis trial is about to eliminate the myths around this guy as a Robin Hood figure and let everyone know he is a bona fide rat,\u201d Mr. Cardinale said. He added that he saw the trial as \u201ca big, face-saving gesture\u201d on Mr. Bulger\u2019s part. \u201cHe wants to say: \u2018Sure, I was a criminal, but why would I need to be a rat if I was so successful? And most important, I didn\u2019t kill those two women.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nIn court, the prosecution treated Mr. Martorano, a star witness, with kid gloves as it led him through sanitized descriptions of many of his murders. But the defense painted an entirely different picture, of a ruthless killer who gunned down innocent bystanders without remorse and who lied. And it charged especially hard at Mr. Martorano\u2019s notion that he had been doing the right thing by his friends and family.         \n\n\u201cWhen you were doing the \u2018right thing\u2019 killing these people, why did you run and hide?\u201d Mr. Brennan, the defense lawyer, asked him. \u201cIf you got caught, couldn\u2019t you just explain that you were doing the right thing?\u201d         \n\nMr. Martorano had no answer.
