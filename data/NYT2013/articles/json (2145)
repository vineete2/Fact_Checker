{"headline": "In the Land of Punk", "body": "\nCBGB was going down to Georgia. So was I.         \n\nIt was the spring of 2012, and I had just read that the movie director Randall Miller and the actor Alan Rickman would be in Savannah to take the legend of the  \nto the world. Why not check this out while I was there?         \n\nThe bar that Hilly Kristal (its founder, played by Mr. Rickman) had imagined as a folk spot in 1973 had instead become the showcase for the likes of the Ramones and Talking Heads, the vanguard of a rebellious rock movement that would be known as punk and then new wave. CBGB symbolized a battle between this edgy surge and the rock that had lost its roll. I knew where I stood and wanted to know where the movie would.         \n\nMany of my friends, fellow baby boomers, didn\u2019t like punk, didn\u2019t understand it or both. To me it was catchy choruses, wild guitars and much more. It reinvented rebellion, laughed at corporate rock. It embodied why we had become fans \u2014 and players \u2014 in the first place.         \n\nWe were driven by rock. Many of us were musicians, some were drummers, all were critics. Being a bass player, I was sort of in the first grouping, and definitely in the last.         \n\nIn New York, and on my Long Island, radio was where rock lived, specifically WNEW-FM. But the station was showing its years. One Friday, Scott Muni seemed to take a step forward on the \u201cThings From England\u201d segment of his show. He introduced the Sex Pistols! He played \u201cGod Save the Queen.\u201d It roared, snarled, thrilled. It faded out at the first chorus!         \n\nThe Professor, as Mr. Muni was known, couldn\u2019t take it. He shut it down and out. Just as Elvis Presley\u2019s 45s were shattered on the air, and Beatles LPs were burned in bonfires, Mr. Muni and WNEW had turned their back on rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. And now I on WNEW.         \n\nLike the public, most of my pals shared Mr. Muni\u2019s view. The rest of us turned to the Bowery.         \n\nThe cultural association that had begun in the 1960s with Andy Warhol\u2019s anointing of Lou Reed and the Velvet Underground at the Electric Circus had moved to the new club, CBGB. There you could hear the yelping guitars and howling lyrics of Tom Verlaine and Richard Hell\u2019s band Television. There, too, was Patti Smith, a close friend of the artist Robert Mapplethorpe, and Talking Heads.         \nTalking Heads, \"Psycho Killer\" Live at CBGB, 1975 \n\nSoon after he helped open the doors of CBGB, Mr. Hell left Television, and he canonized everyone associated with the movement as the \u201cBlank Generation,\u201d the rootless, searching pack that had found its place there among the poets and painters, drunkards and addicts of the East Side.         \n\nI was a little late to the Beatles invasion; maybe this was My Generation.         \n\nMy friends had formed a group and played at CBGB on open mic nights. I once heard them on the radio while driving. The excitement was tempered by a tear. That could have been me. Still, helping to load in and out, being alone with them in CBGB, sort of made up for it.         \n\nAnd later, when another friend started playing there, I would tag along, taking in the soundcheck done on the most powerful P.A. ever assembled, walls just plastered in stickers, the bathroom just covered in \u2026 stickers. I tried to look as if I belonged, and maybe I did.         \n\nSo it was with this insight I made my journey into Savannah in search of \u201cCBGB.\u201d There were many observers, but they did not seem hell bent for leather; it turns out we were right next to Paula Deen\u2019s restaurant. I had to shove aside its customers to get a look at the reimagined Ramones.         \n\nThe Ramones were my favorite. They were everybody\u2019s. They were the only band that muttered.         \n\nI had seen the Ramones not at CBGB, but on Long Island at our beloved My Father\u2019s Place in Roslyn, which had featured acts like Linda Ronstadt and Jackson Browne but was giving way to punk and new wave acts like Blondie, Squeeze and even the Police. The sound of New York thrived on the Island. The Ramones made it official. And I loved them for it.         \n\nUnder the hot Georgian sun, I peered upon these leather-clad lads and believed. They looked right. They were height accurate. Joey was towering; Tommy, tiny. They stood around looking as if they had nothing to do. Like real Ramones. And where there were Ramones, there was hope.         \n\nI did not know it then, but I would soon be living where they once roamed.
