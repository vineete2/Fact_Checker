{"headline": "G.O.P. Expresses Hope as Obama Praises Syria Deal", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama\u2019s Congressional critics expressed guarded optimism about an agreement reached with Russia over the weekend to seize and destroy Syria\u2019s chemical weapons, even as Mr. Obama hailed the diplomatic effort as a \u201cfoundation\u201d that could lead to a political settlement in that country\u2019s civil war.         \n\nMr. Obama said in an interview that was broadcast on Sunday that the United States was in a \u201cbetter position\u201d to prevent President Bashar al-Assad of Syria from using poison gas again because of the deal produced by Secretary of State John Kerry and Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister.         \n\n\u201cLook, we\u2019re not there yet,\u201d Mr. Obama said in the interview, taped Friday, with George Stephanopoulos for the ABC News program \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t have an actual, verifiable deal that will begin that process. But the distance that we\u2019ve traveled over these couple of weeks is remarkable.\u201d         \n\nIn interviews on Sunday, lawmakers in Washington described the agreement as a risky one, with potential benefits for stability in the Middle East if it succeeds and huge risks for Mr. Obama \u2014 both abroad and at home \u2014 if it fails. Several senators said Mr. Obama would deserve credit for avoiding a military strike if the chemical weapons could be eliminated in the midst of a civil war.         \n\nSenator Bob Corker of Tennessee, who just days earlier had described Mr. Obama as seeming \u201cuncomfortable\u201d in the role of commander in chief, said the president may have turned a \u201cmuddled\u201d and \u201cclunky\u201d foreign policy response into a tentative diplomatic win.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for anybody to pooh-pooh the idea that we may be on the way to a diplomatic solution,\u201d said Mr. Corker, the ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.         \n\nAnother Republican, Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, said the United States now had the opportunity to \u201cparlay\u201d the negotiations over chemical weapons into broader talks to find a political end to Syria\u2019s civil war and the removal of Mr. Assad from power.         \n\n\u201cIf the framework can actually be implemented, obviously it will be a big step in the right direction,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. Of Mr. Obama and his strategy, he said: \u201cI hope it works out. I truly do. If he succeeds with this framework, people have to give him credit.\u201d         \n\nBut senators from both parties also expressed deep concern about the possibility that the diplomacy could fail, perhaps spectacularly, and that Mr. Obama\u2019s actions over the past two weeks had strengthened the credibility of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia at the expense of America\u2019s reputation around the world.         \n\n\u201cI have to be honest with you, it\u2019s also fraught with danger,\u201d said Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey. \u201cThe president will reap whatever achievements can be gleaned from this agreement \u2014 if it is successful.\u201d         \n\nIn the ABC interview, Mr. Obama said his critics had been judging him on the style but not the substance of his policies during the past several weeks. He said he was not concerned with earning \u201cstyle points\u201d in the conduct of foreign policy, and he pointed to President George W. Bush\u2019s decision to go to war in Iraq as an example of making the wrong call.         \n\n\u201cHad we rolled out something that was very smooth and disciplined and linear, they would have graded it well, even if it was a disastrous policy,\u201d Mr. Obama said, adding, \u201cWe know that, because that\u2019s exactly how they graded the Iraq war.\u201d         \n\nAfter watching the interview, Mr. Johnson said Mr. Obama\u2019s international credibility would be repaired somewhat if the chemical weapons were neutralized through the diplomatic process. But he said that did not excuse some of the choices the president had made.         \n\n\u201cThis process has not been particularly stylish. It hasn\u2019t been pretty,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cUnfortunately, President Obama\u2019s credibility hasn\u2019t been strengthened.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/16/world/middleeast/syria-chemical-weapons-deal.html", "date": "2013-09-15", "description": "President Obama\u2019s Congressional critics expressed guarded optimism about an agreement reached with Russia, even as Mr. Obama hailed the diplomatic effort."}
