{"headline": "In Suit Over Death, Boogaard\u2019s Family Blames the N.H.L.", "body": "\nThe family of Derek Boogaard has filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against the National Hockey League.         \n\nIt contends that the N.H.L. is responsible for the physical trauma and brain damage that Boogaard sustained during six seasons as one of the league\u2019s top enforcers, and for the addiction to prescription painkillers that marked his final two years.         \n\nBoogaard was under contract to the  \n when he was found dead of an accidental overdose of prescription painkillers and alcohol on May 13, 2011. He was 28. He was posthumously found to have chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., a brain disease caused by repeated blows to the head.         \n\n\u201cTo distill this to one sentence,\u201d said William Gibbs, a lawyer for the Boogaards, \u201cyou take a young man, you subject him to trauma, you give him pills for that trauma, he becomes addicted to those pills, you promise to treat him for that addiction, and you fail.\u201d         \n\nThe N.H.L., through a spokesman, declined to comment Sunday.         \n\nIn 55 pages of detailed accusations, the suit does not seek specific damages to be awarded to Boogaard\u2019s parents and four siblings. It asks that a trial jury determine \u201ca sum in excess of the minimum jurisdictional limit\u201d for each of eight counts in the suit.         \n\nLen Boogaard, Derek\u2019s father, declined to comment.         \n\nThe suit was filed late Friday by the Chicago law firm of Corboy & Demetrio in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Ill. The firm brought a similar case against the N.F.L. in 2012 on behalf of Dave Duerson, a former Bears player who committed suicide in 2011 at age 50 and was found to have C.T.E. His suit has been consolidated with that of roughly 4,200 former N.F.L. players suing the league for damages incurred during their athletic careers.         \n\nThe Boogaard suit against the N.H.L. was filed in time to beat two-year statutes of limitation for wrongful-death cases in places like Illinois and New York, Gibbs said.         \n\nA previous lawsuit that the Boogaard family filed against the N.H.L. Players\u2019 Association last September, through a different lawyer, was dismissed this spring. In that case, the family said the union, after expressing interest in helping pursue a case against the league, had missed a deadline for filing a grievance.         \n\nA judge, in turn, ruled that the family had waited too long to act and dismissed the case.         \n\nWhile this Boogaard lawsuit is broadly aimed at the N.H.L., it details the care that Boogaard received from specific team doctors of the Rangers and the  \n, and the co-directors and a primary counselor of the league\u2019s Substance Abuse and Behavioral Health Program, which oversaw Boogaard\u2019s care after he entered rehabilitation while playing for the Wild in September 2009.         \n\nIn July 2010, after five seasons with the Wild, Boogaard signed a four-year, $6.5 million contract with the Rangers. His last game was on Dec. 9, 2010, when Boogaard sustained a concussion \u2014 one of dozens, the family believes \u2014 during a fight in Ottawa.         \n\nThe next April, after stumbling on the ice during a Rangers workout, Boogaard was sent to drug rehabilitation a second time. It was during that stint that he was granted two extended, unsupervised recesses. He died in his Minneapolis apartment on the first night of his second leave.         \n\nThe lawsuit notes that Boogaard played in 277 N.H.L. games over six seasons and scored three goals. He fought at least 66 times on the ice and, according to the suit, \u201cwas provided copious amounts of prescription pain medications, sleeping pills, and painkiller injections by N.H.L. teams\u2019 physicians, dentists, trainers and staff\u201d to combat the injuries and pain he endured.         \n\nFor example, the suit alleges that Boogaard was given at least 13 injections of Toradol, a masking agent for pain, in the last two years of his career, by doctors of at least seven N.H.L. teams.         \n\nThe suit also says that Boogaard was prescribed 1,021 pills from about a dozen doctors during the 2008-9 season with the Wild. At the end of that season, after operations on his nose and his shoulder, doctors prescribed Boogaard 150 pills of oxycodone over 16 days, the suit alleges.         \n\nMonths later, during training camp, Boogaard was sent to drug rehabilitation for an addiction to prescription painkillers.         \n\n\u201cDue to his ingestion of an inordinate amount of pain medications prescribed by N.H.L. team physicians, Derek Boogaard became addicted to opioids,\u201d the suit alleges.         \n\nIt states that the N.H.L. \u201cbreached its duty\u201d to Boogaard by, among other things, failing to monitor his prescriptions or establish proper procedures for administering and tracking them. It alleges that the substance-abuse program knew that Boogaard violated its rules many times \u2014 including a series of failed drug tests in his final months and his admission that he sometimes bought painkillers illegally \u2014 yet never disciplined or suspended him, as program rules dictate.         \n\nThe lawsuit also says that the N.H.L. should have known that \u201cenforcers/fighters\u201d had increased risk for injuries, concussions and addiction.         \n\n\u201cOn numerous occasions, the N.H.L. allowed and encouraged Derek Boogaard, after suffering concussions, to return to play and fight in the same game and/or practice,\u201d the suit alleges.         \n\nGibbs, the family\u2019s lawyer, said: \u201cIt\u2019s easy to watch a game and see these guys as superhuman. And they are not.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/13/sports/hockey/derek-boogaards-family-sues-nhl-for-wrongful-death.html", "date": "2013-05-12", "description": "The family of the National Hockey League enforcer Derek Boogaard, who died of an overdose of painkillers in 2011, says the league failed to monitor his prescriptions."}
