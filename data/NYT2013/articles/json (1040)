{"headline": "A Stellar Farro Salad From Charlie Bird", "body": "\nCould farro salad be the new couscous salad? You certainly see it often enough on menus and at fancy takeout shops to make the case. But like with its cousin couscous, farro salad can be hit or miss. Sometimes it\u2019s a deeply flavored, multi-textured delight. Sometimes it\u2019s dull and bland.         \n\nBut that\u2019s not the farro\u2019s fault. This hardy, earthy grain has plenty of flavor if you treat it right. And to do so isn\u2019t hard.         \n\nThere are two essential steps to a stellar farro salad. The first is cooking the farro with enough salt and aromatics so that it is delicious before you combine it with the rest of the ingredients. The second is to use enough very good olive oil in the dressing. Farro is one of those good-for-you grains that needs plenty of rich treatment to overcome its healthful profile. But if you do both of these things, it really doesn\u2019t matter what other cheese, vegetable, fruit or nut you add to your salad bowl. With this foundation, you\u2019re guaranteed a terrific result.         \n\nCase in point: the chef Ryan Hardy at  \n in SoHo cooks the farro for his salad in apple cider seasoned with bay leaves and plenty of salt, which renders it good enough to eat on its own. But it\u2019s even better after he adds loads of olive oil, plus pistachio nuts and Parmesan cheese to make it even richer. Then, before serving, he folds in fresh vegetables to brighten it up: juicy tomatoes, radishes, arugula and plenty of herbs.         \n\nIt\u2019s everything you want in a farro salad. Or a couscous salad, for that matter.         \n\nRecipe:  \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/17/dining/a-stellar-farro-salad-from-charlie-bird.html", "date": "2013-12-16", "description": "This hardy, earthy grain has plenty of flavor if you treat it right.
