{"headline": "Mutiny Halts Italian Gambit by Berlusconi", "body": "\nROME \u2014 He seemed stunned, if immaculately tailored in a dark suit that sheathed him like armor.         \n\nBut the Silvio Berlusconi who stood before the Italian Senate on Wednesday was no longer invincible. His brazen attempt to bring down Italy\u2019s coalition government had provoked a mutiny in his own party. Most startling, Mr. Berlusconi, the powerful former prime minister, was reversing himself and bending to the rebellion.         \n\nFor all the Shakespearean elements of pride, betrayal and hubris displayed on Wednesday during the political theatrics, the government survived a confidence vote with unexpected ease. The more significant news was that moderates promising deep reforms scored an unusually decisive victory in the most unstable of the euro zone\u2019s big economies.         \n\nAt a time when several major countries, notably including the United States, are paralyzed by partisan political warfare, the defeat for Mr. Berlusconi was greeted by many as a welcome, if still tentative, sign that Italy could carry out long-delayed changes to its political system and take steps to revive its sclerotic economy. \u201cWe are seeing the long twilight of the Berlusconi era,\u201d said Roberto D\u2019Alimonte, a political analyst in Rome.         \n\nMr. Berlusconi\u2019s attempt to bring down the government was intended to resuscitate his endangered political career as he faces a pending prison sentence, analysts say. Instead, it fractured his center-right movement in Italy, which was threatened with a wave of defections. Standing in the Senate, Mr. Berlusconi, 77, was forced to reverse himself and pledge his party\u2019s support for the same government that he had failed to topple.         \n\nPolitical instability is considered one of Italy\u2019s most endemic bugaboos, commonly blamed for the country\u2019s inability to undertake difficult but critical economic and electoral changes. European officials are especially worried about instability in Italy, one of the largest and most important economies in the euro zone, and fretted that new elections might unleash populist anger and threaten the tentative recovery under way on the Continent.         \n\nNow the question is whether Italy\u2019s newly validated government can approve sweeping changes to a flawed electoral system that seems designed to produce splintered results. The government was formed five months ago after inconclusive results in national elections; it is an awkward, midwifed partnership between Italy\u2019s competing center-left and center-right parties.         \n\nThe country\u2019s youthful prime minister, Enrico Letta, was often regarded as a doomed figure: sober and well intentioned but trapped by an unworkable political marriage. On Wednesday, Mr. Letta, 47, made a forceful plea on behalf of the government, warning lawmakers that Italy was emerging from its worst economic slump since World War II and that dissolving the government would only deepen the crisis.         \n\nMr. Letta\u2019s top priority is rejuvenating Italy\u2019s cumbersome electoral system and streamlining the country\u2019s multiple and costly layers of government. Currently, Italy\u2019s Parliament has nearly 1,000 members in the Senate and the Lower House, a figure that lawmakers concede should be sharply reduced.         \n\nMoreover, the Parliament is under pressure to pass structural changes in how elections are conducted, so voters can more directly select their representatives, rather than the current system that uses complicated formulas to calculate vote shares.         \n\nOn the economy, Mr. Letta has promised to cut taxes on employers and workers and to push steps to make Italy more competitive. On Wednesday, he also promised to crack down on tax evasion and emphasized the need to reduce a jobs crisis that has pushed youth unemployment to 40 percent.         \n\nHe also made clear that Italy\u2019s fate is intertwined with that of Europe, and that Italian lawmakers needed to prove they were responsible stewards, willing to tackle tough issues. He said that the political roller coaster that had consumed Italy this year was no longer tenable, and that the government needed a strong confidence vote as an endorsement to push through big changes and send a signal of stability to businesses and investors.         \n\n\u201cCourage and confidence is what I am asking of you,\u201d he said. \u201cGive us the confidence to fulfill our goals, for all that we have accomplished and started in these few months.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/03/world/europe/italy-politics-coalition-government-enrico-letta-silvio-berlusconi.html", "date": "2013-10-02", "description": "Former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s attempt to resuscitate his endangered political career by bringing down the government instead provoked a rebellion in his own party."}
