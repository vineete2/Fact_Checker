{"headline": "Cute and Cozy (for a Loaf of Bread)", "body": "\nEvery once in a while I fall for cute in a really bad way. One of the worst times, about 40 years ago, involved a pale blue Fiat 850 convertible that I bought from a guy I knew. It overheated the first time I took it out on the road, teaching me the meaning of the terms \u201ccracked engine block\u201d and \u201ctrust.\u201d         \n\nSince then, I have grown older but have learned absolutely nothing, as is often the case. This is the only explanation I have for the renovated 1950s trailer.         \n\nCute? You have not seen cute until you have seen one of these little numbers. This particular one was pale turquoise and looked like a rounded tin breadbox. It had been tricked out with all sorts of adorable retro items: a satin souvenir pillow from Fort Dix, N.J., with a really bad poem to \u201cmy sweetheart,\u201d a hassock covered with flowery vintage fabric, a padded dinette beneath the louvered windows.         \n\nMaybe people in their 60s who remember the open-road ads for trailers in The Saturday Evening Post are especially vulnerable to these things. When a friend, also named Joyce, showed me the pictures, I heard myself emitting such high-pitched screeching noises that it was as if I were two 16-year-old girls, meeting each other after an absence of three hours.         \n\nImagine it in the key of E sharp: \u201cOh, my God, it\u2019s perfect. And nobody has slept in it yet? Oh, who cares if there\u2019s no plumbing? It\u2019s so cuuuute!\u201d         \n\nYou know how there are certain signs that someone is suffering heatstroke or has one of those little blood clots on the brain that require immediate medical attention? With me, the warning sign would be the words \u201cwho cares if there\u2019s no plumbing?\u201d         \n\nWhen Joyce II told me that her husband, who is one of those guys who can build anything, had built an adorable little outhouse behind the trailer, I thought that was also cute. Kerosene lamps? I\u2019ve never seen one, but that has to be the cutest thing I have ever heard of.         \n\nDid I mention that my friends\u2019 place is off the grid, on the side of a mountain in upstate New York, a cabin they built themselves over several decades, using logs that a guy with a team of horses pulled out of the woods? And that their electricity is supplied by a gas-powered generator? Think of it as foreshadowing.         \n\nAnyway, summer comes and off I go. The trailer, which sits on top of some partly exposed boulders that my friends have been digging out to build a deck, is so cute that I start taking pictures even before I get out of the car. The weather has been alternately steamy and rainy, so there\u2019s a bit of mud, but I barely notice.         \n\nWalking inside is like stepping out of a time machine set to Archie and Veronica: There\u2019s a vintage red-and-white Coca-Cola cooler that Joyce II has stocked with white wine and raspberries and bottled water; a Real Host gas burner and a beat-up tin saucepan so I can make coffee in the morning; a few innocent 1950s girlie postcards tacked to a wall. The seats of the dinette have been turned into a bed with a view of the woods and a pond.         \n\nIt\u2019s a little steamy, but I am sure things will cool down at night. I go down to the cabin, hang with the hosts, and then, around 11 p.m., they give me a flashlight and I head back up the hill to Cutesville.         \n\nThis is where I learn something interesting about mud on rocks: While a little worrisome during the day, it is positively scary at night, when you can\u2019t see where you are walking. Also, if it\u2019s steamy outside a trailer, it\u2019s steamy inside.         \n\nAnd flashlights, it turns out, don\u2019t provide a whole lot of light. The trailer is supposed to be wired for electricity, but the switch to turn that electricity on, my hosts have told me, is outside on a tree. There are a lot of trees in this part of the Catskills. I do see something next to the bed that may be a kerosene lamp, but I\u2019m not touching it. A bold foray is made back outside, over the muddied slope. After a certain amount of promiscuous tree fondling, the electricity tree is found, and I have light in the trailer.         \n\nUnfortunately, after turning off the lights and trying to doze off to the bucolic hum of the gas generator, I realize I have developed a bone spur on my left hip, which coincidentally is the hip I sleep on. A medical anomaly, but one I am able to determine the cause of quickly: my mattress consists of two authentic dinette seats plopped on top of a dinette table, and they are not thick. They are reminding me of the skinny, rolled-up mattresses in the deserted Catskills hotels of my youth, except that when I was rolling around on those, I was having fun.         \n\nAnd, of course, as a teenager, I never had to make middle-of-the-night trips to the bathroom \u2014 a necessity that comes at around 4:30 a.m., when there is no light anywhere on the property because the generator has run out of gas. Clutching my inadequate flashlight, I head out over the slippery and now barely visible rocks to the outhouse.         \n\nNaturally, it is another triumph of cute: there is a ceramic \u201centrance\u201d sign on the door, a shellacked and gleaming wooden toilet seat, and a magazine rack with the latest issues of the National Enquirer.         \n\nI take my hosts\u2019 word on that last, as the little flashlight is not powerful enough to read by, and with a muddy and by now chilly trek back to the trailer ahead of me, I do not wish to linger. (One learns bitter truths about oneself in nature, and mine is that I am not good with mud. If you\u2019re thinking of suggesting me for \u201cSurvivor,\u201d don\u2019t.)         \n\nOn the plus side, I tell myself, I have now had the experience of spending the night in an authentic 1950s trailer. And in the morning, I have the even better experience of leaving it. I pack up and head to the guest room in my friends\u2019 cabin, which has a sturdy Adirondack bed with a thick mattress, a boxy bedside stand with no discernible detail and a bathroom around the corner.         \n\nI have stayed in this room before, and here is what I love about it: it is not cute.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/31/booming/cute-and-cozy-for-a-loaf-of-bread.html", "date": "2013-07-31", "description": "A 1950s trailer \u2014 who cared if there was no plumbing?
