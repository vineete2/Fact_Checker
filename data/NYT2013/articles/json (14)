{"headline": "General Details Pentagon Tensions With Obama on Afghanistan", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In a memoir, Gen.  \n, the former American commander in  \n, writes that tensions between the White House and the Pentagon were evident in the Obama administration from its opening months in office.         \n\nThe beginning of  \n\u2019s first term \u201csaw the emergence of an unfortunate deficit of trust between the White House and the Department of Defense, largely arising from the decision-making process on Afghanistan,\u201d General McChrystal writes. \u201cThe effects were costly.\u201d         \n\nThe book by General McChrystal,  \n in 2010 after an  \n quoted him and his staff making dismissive comments about the White House, is likely to disappoint readers who are looking for a vivid blow-by-blow account of infighting within the administration.         \n\n \n, titled \u201cMy Share of the Task: A Memoir,\u201d does not provide an account of the White House meeting at which Mr. Obama accepted the general\u2019s resignation. General McChrystal\u2019s tone toward Mr. Obama is respectful, and he notes that his wife, Annie, joined the crowd at Mr. Obama\u2019s inauguration. The book is to be released on Monday.         \n\nAn advance copy of the book provides revealing glimpses of the friction over military planning and comes as Mr. Obama is weighing, and perhaps preparing to overrule, the troop requests that have been presented by the current American commander in Afghanistan, Gen. John R. Allen.         \n\nThe account is all the more noteworthy since General McChrystal, who retired from the Army, remains a respected voice within the military and teaches a course on leadership at Yale.         \n\nAccording to the book, the tensions began before General McChrystal took command in Kabul, Afghanistan, and were set off by a request from his predecessor,  \n, for 30,000 additional troops at the end of the Bush administration.         \n\nInstead of approving the entire request, in February 2009, Mr. Obama decided that 17,000 would be sent, adding that decisions on additional deployments would be based on further analysis.         \n\nFrom the White House perspective, General McChrystal writes, \u201cthis partial decision was logical.\u201d After less than a month, the president had increased American forces in Afghanistan by 50 percent. Though Mr. Obama had cast the conflict in Afghanistan as a \u201cwar of necessity,\u201d as a candidate he was nonetheless wary about a prolonged American military involvement there.         \n\nBut the Pentagon pressed for an additional 4,000 troops, fearing that there was little time to reverse the Taliban\u2019s gains before the August elections in Afghanistan.         \n\n\u201cThe military felt a sense of urgency, seeing little remaining time if any forces approved were to reach Afghanistan in time to improve security in advance of the elections,\u201d he wrote.         \n\nThe White House later approved the 4,000 troops, but the dispute pointed to a deeper clash of cultures over the use of force that continued after General McChrystal took command.         \n\n\u201cMilitary leaders, many of whom were students of counterinsurgency, recognized the dangers of an incremental escalation, and the historical lesson that \u2018trailing\u2019 an insurgency typically condemned counterinsurgents to failure,\u201d he writes.         \n\nIn May 2009, soon before he assumed command in Kabul, General McChrystal had a \u201cshort, but cordial\u201d meeting with Mr. Obama at which the president \u201coffered no specific guidance,\u201d he notes.         \n\nThe next month, General McChrystal was surprised when James L. Jones, Mr. Obama\u2019s  \n, told him that the Obama administration would not consider sending more forces until the effect of arriving units could be fully evaluated.         \n\nThat contradicted the guidance that General McChrystal had received from Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates that he should submit an assessment in August of the additional forces that might be required, he writes.         \n\nAt an Oct. 8, 2009, video conference with Mr. Obama\u2019s National Security Council, differences again emerged when General McChrystal outlined his goals: \u201cDefeat the Taliban. Secure the population.\u201d         \n\nThat prompted a challenge by a Washington-based official, whom General McChrystal does not name, that the goal of defeating the Taliban seemed too ambitious and that the command in Kabul should settle instead for an effort to \u201cdegrade\u201d the Taliban.         \n\nAt the next video conference, General McChrystal presented a slide showing that his objectives had been derived from Mr. Obama\u2019s own speeches and a White House strategy review. \u201cBut it was clear to me that the mission itself was now on the table for review and adjustment,\u201d he wrote.         \n\nAfter General McChrystal determined that at least 40,000 additional forces were needed to reverse the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan, Mr. Obama provided 30,000 and said he would ask allied nations to contribute the rest.         \n\nGeneral McChrystal acknowledges that he had concerns that Mr. Obama\u2019s decision to announce a date for beginning the withdrawal of the additional \u201csurge\u201d forces might embolden the Taliban. But the general writes that he did not challenge the decision.         \n\n\u201cIf I felt like the decision to set a withdrawal date would have been fatal to the success of our mission, I\u2019d have said so,\u201d he writes.         \n\nGeneral McChrystal has little to say about the episode that led to the article in Rolling Stone. He writes that the comments attributed to his team were \u201cunacceptable\u201d but adds that he was surprised by the tone of the article, which he had expected would show the camaraderie among the American, British, French and Afghan officers.         \n\nAs the controversy over the article grew, General McChrystal did not seek advice before offering his resignation. The book does not say if he was disappointed when Mr. Obama accepted it at a brief White House meeting.         \n\nReturning to his quarters at Fort McNair after that White House meeting, he broke the news to his wife: \u201cI told her that our life in the Army was over.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/world/asia/mcchrystal-book-details-tensions-with-obama.html", "date": "2013-01-05", "description": "In a long-awaited memoir, Gen.
