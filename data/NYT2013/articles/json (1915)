{"headline": "Facebook Eases Privacy Rules for Teenagers", "body": "\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Facebook has loosened its privacy rules for teenagers as a debate swirls over online threats to children from bullies and sexual predators.         \n\nThe move,  \n, allows teenagers to post status updates, videos and images that can be seen by anyone, not just their friends or people who know their friends.         \n\nWhile Facebook described the change as giving teenagers, ages 13 to 17, more choice, big money is at stake for the company and its advertisers. Marketers are keen to reach impressionable young consumers, and the more public information they have about those users, the better they are able to target their pitches.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about monetization and being where the public dialogue is,\u201d said Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a group that lobbies against marketing to children. \u201cTo the extent that Facebook encourages people to put everything out there, it\u2019s incredibly attractive to Facebook\u2019s advertisers.\u201d         \n\nBut that public dialogue now includes youths who are growing up in a world of social media and, often, learning the hard way that it can be full of risks. Parents, too, are trying to help their children navigate the raucous online world that holds both promise and peril.         \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re hitting kids from a neurological weak spot. Kids don\u2019t have the same kind of impulse control that adults do,\u201d said Emily Bazelon, a journalist and author of the book \u201cSticks and Stones: Defeating the Culture of Bullying and Rediscovering the Power of Character and Empathy.\u201d         \n\nFacebook said numerous other sites and mobile apps, from big players like Twitter and Instagram to lesser-known ones like ask.fm and Kik, allowed teenagers to express themselves publicly.         \n\n\u201cAcross the Web, teens can have a very public voice on those services, and it would be a shame if they could not do that on Facebook,\u201d Nicky Jackson Colaco, Facebook\u2019s manager of privacy and public policy, said in a phone interview.         \n\nBut unlike those other services, Facebook requires users to post under their real identities, which some privacy advocates said would make it much more difficult to run away from stupid or thoughtless remarks.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s risky to have teenagers posting publicly,\u201d Ms. Bazelon said. \u201cThe kids who might be the most likely to do that might not have the best judgment about what they post.\u201d         \n\nFacebook also said it made the change to let its most knowledgable users \u2014 socially active teenagers like musicians and humanitarian activists \u2014 reach a wider audience the way they can on blogs and rival services like Twitter.         \n\nFacebook changed another aspect of its rules for teenagers, for which it drew praise. By default, new accounts for teenagers will be set up to share information only with friends, not friends of friends as before. Ms. Colaco said the company would also educate teenagers about the risks of sharing information and periodically remind them, if they make public posts, that everyone can see what they are sharing.         \n\nBut fundamentally, Facebook wants to encourage more public sharing, not less.         \n\nThe company, which has about its 1.2 billion users worldwide, is locked in a battle with Twitter and Google to attract consumer advertisers like food, phone and clothing companies. Those brands want to reach people as they engage in passionate public conversation about sports, television, news and live events.         \n\nTwitter, which has been emphasizing its virtue as a real-time public platform as it prepares to make a public offering of stock next month, has been particularly effective at persuading marketers that it is the best way to reach audiences talking about the hottest television show or the week\u2019s National Football League games.         \n\nFacebook is reducing children\u2019s privacy even as lawmakers are moving in the opposite direction, grappling with difficult issues like online bullying and the question of whether to allow people to erase their digital histories.
