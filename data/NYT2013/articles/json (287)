{"headline": "James Takes the Blame for Miami\u2019s Struggles", "body": "\nSAN ANTONIO \u2014 The questions and the criticism were coming just as assuredly and relentlessly as the  \n had come at him the night before.  \n surveyed the room, tapped his fingers on the table and embraced the burden.         \n\n\u201cI am the star,\u201d he said Wednesday. \u201cI am the leader.\u201d         \n\nThere are probably a dozen reasons that the  \n are facing a 2-1 deficit in the N.B.A. finals, from the decline of Dwyane Wade to the disappearance of Chris Bosh and the withering of their supporting cast. The disciplined ferocity of the Spurs could be given some credit, too.         \n\nBut the Heat ultimately rise and fall based on the strength, talent and poise of James, their star and leader, and this seemed as apparent to him as it did to everyone else after he turned in another subpar performance, in Tuesday\u2019s 113-77 loss to the Spurs.         \n\n\u201cI take full responsibility for our team\u2019s performance last night,\u201d James said, looking poised on the podium but seething all the same. \u201cMe as a leader, I can\u2019t afford to perform like I did last night and expect us to win on the road. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d         \n\nAlthough he has been effective in spurts, James has been largely contained, his offensive skills blunted by a Spurs defense that has walled off the paint, crowded him and lulled him into midrange jump shots.         \n\nJames is shooting .389 from the field and averaging 16.7 points per game in the series, and he has attempted a mere six free throws \u2014 10 fewer than he took in a Game 7 victory over Indiana in the Eastern Conference finals. He had no foul shots on Tuesday, the first time that had happened since Dec. 2, 2009.         \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t allow that to happen,\u201d James said. \u201cI have to try to put more pressure on the defense.\u201d         \n\nSince arriving in the N.B.A. in 2003 as a precocious teenager, James has been a star who prides himself on making the smart play, who can win a game with his playmaking or his defense. His dominance has rarely been dependent on scoring alone, and he sometimes seems altogether reluctant to commandeer the offense.         \n\nThe Heat\u2019s title defense might depend on James\u2019s doing exactly that. They cannot expect much from Wade, who is laboring on a sore right knee and averaging 14.3 points against the Spurs. They cannot rely on Bosh, who is averaging 12.3 points. The Big 3 is not what it was a year ago, when the Heat were grinding up the Oklahoma City Thunder on the way to the championship.         \n\n\u201cIf us three don\u2019t lead the charge, we\u2019re not going to be N.B.A. champions,\u201d Wade said. \u201cOur teammates count on us, so we have to step up.\u201d         \n\nThe Spurs recognize the difference, and they are not afraid to point it out.         \n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen Dwyane Wade before, and he\u2019s obviously not playing the way he\u2019s played before,\u201d the Spurs\u2019 Danny Green said. \u201cIt seems like something\u2019s wrong: either he\u2019s worn down from the Indiana series or injuries or probably a little bit of everything.\u201d         \n\nThe same concerns dogged the Heat throughout the Eastern Conference finals, a primary reason that series stretched to seven games. Miami finished off the Pacers when James asserted himself: he scored 30, 29 and 32 points in the final three games, two of which were Heat victories. In the finals, James has scored 18, 17 and 15 points \u2014 his least productive three-game stretch of the season.         \n\nIt sounded like a subtle indictment when Green, the young Spurs swingman, observed Tuesday that it was \u201cnot just us stopping\u201d James; \u201che\u2019s kind of stopped himself out there.\u201d         \n\nGreen, who played with James in Cleveland, elaborated on Wednesday, saying: \u201cWe all know what he\u2019s capable of doing. And it seems as if \u2014 I don\u2019t know what it is going on, but he\u2019s not playing his best basketball right now.\u201d         \n\nThe Spurs have their own concerns. Tony Parker, their star point guard, sustained a Grade 1 strain of his right hamstring, leaving his status unclear for Thursday\u2019s Game 4. He is listed as day to day.         \n\nIf Parker is unable to play, or is even diminished, it could swing the momentum back to the Heat. But they will still need more from James.         \n\nTwo years ago, Dallas won a championship at the Heat\u2019s expense, and Dirk Nowitzki  \n, posting a photo of the championship banner.         \n\nThe timing was interesting. Two years ago, James was cast as a passive star who lacked the mental makeup to take control of his own destiny and seize the moment. James effectively crushed that narrative last June, when he dominated in the finals and claimed his first title. Now, the old, familiar criticisms have crept back into the conversation.         \n\nSo James spent his 11 minutes on the podium Wednesday gritting his teeth and scrunching up his face as he dealt anew with that perception. He was neither defensive nor combative, seeming steadfast and brutally honest in his self-assessment and admitting that his Game 3 performance \u201cwas weighing heavily on me\u201d Tuesday night. \u201cI didn\u2019t particularly care for myself at that point in time,\u201d he said.         \n\nAsked about Green\u2019s observation \u2014 that he had stopped himself \u2014 James looked down, paused, tapped his fingers, grinned slightly and said: \u201cI\u2019ll be better. I\u2019ll be much better tomorrow night.\u201d         \n\nAnd what would \u201cbetter\u201d mean? \u201cBetter than last night,\u201d James said, using an expletive to describe his game.         \n\nJames gave his presentation with a red practice jersey looped around his neck and draped over his shoulders, like a superhero\u2019s cape. The image said everything.
