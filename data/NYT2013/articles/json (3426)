{"headline": "Chiefs Deflate Giants\u2019 Momentum, Sending Them to Another Loss", "body": "\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. \u2014 The Giants\u2019 patchwork offensive line had played reasonably well. The team\u2019s running game, while not overpowering, was not a hopeless liability for the first time this season. Eli Manning had time to throw, even if his receivers were dropping some passes. The Giants, for a change, did not have a ton of turnovers, and their defense, which had yielded only one touchdown, had recovered a fumble and intercepted two passes.         \n\nAnd with less than two minutes remaining in the third quarter, the winless Giants trailed the undefeated Kansas City Chiefs by only 3 points.         \n\n\u201cWe were in a dogfight,\u201d Giants defensive end Justin Tuck said. \u201cI figured we needed one play to turn it around for us.\u201d         \n\nThe Giants even had some measure of momentum as Manning appeared to pick up a crucial first down deep in their own territory. But what had been ruled a 17-yard third-down catch by Victor Cruz was changed to a 16-yard reception after a replay challenge. The Giants, facing a fourth-and-1, chose to punt.         \n\nThe pivotal turnaround play that Tuck had wondered about came next, when Kansas City\u2019s Dexter McCluster caught Steve Weatherford\u2019s punt at his own 11 and began a spinning, zigzag return, eluding several Giants who dived at his feet as he ran up the middle.         \n\nWhen McCluster was in the end zone 89 yards later, the air had gone out of the Giants\u2019 spirited attempt at a first victory in the 2013 season. What followed was a downward spiral throughout the fourth quarter and a 31-7 victory for the 4-0 Chiefs.         \n\nThe Giants are 0-4 for the first time since the strike-interrupted 1987 season, when they were 0-5 and finished 6-9. In the Giants\u2019 locker room Sunday afternoon, a nightmare of a season continued.         \n\n\u201cI wish somebody would pinch me so I could wake up,\u201d Tuck said. \u201cWe are as low as you can go.\u201d         \n\nCoach Tom Coughlin, whose team has lost 9 of its last 12 games dating to the 2012 season, promised that the Giants would not give up, but he lamented a second half that he called \u201ca debacle.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWe were right there and in the game before the punt return,\u201d Coughlin said. \u201cBut our inability to do anything with the ball in the second half, there\u2019s no excuse for that.\u201d         \n\nCoughlin shook his head, more exasperated than angry.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no continuity,\u201d he said of the team\u2019s offense, which converted once on 14 third-down attempts. \u201cWe get a play here or there, but there is no rhythm. We don\u2019t make any first downs; there\u2019s no feel for the ball being moved continuously down the field. Just extremely poor.\u201d         \n\nThe Giants\u2019 roster is not all that aged, but it seems as if the team\u2019s offense, predicated on a reliable rushing game that sets up a downfield passing attack, has grown tired, stale or predictable \u2014 or all three \u2014 just 20 months after many of the same players used many of the same plays to win a Super Bowl.         \n\nOr maybe that is the problem: the rest of the league has caught on to the Giants\u2019 offensive formula.         \n\nCoughlin did not blame the play-calling, and neither did Manning, who completed 18 of 37 passes for 217 yards, although Manning was left uneasy with how Sunday\u2019s offensive performance unfolded. He cited the first drive of the second half, when the Giants trailed by 10-7.         \n\nA first-down running play lost a yard; on second down, there was an incompletion.         \n\n\u201cYou have a third-and-11 right out of the get-go,\u201d Manning said. \u201cSo if you\u2019re living in that world, you can convert some, but that\u2019s a world you don\u2019t want to live in.\u201d         \n\nEach failure or misstep is a link to the Giants\u2019 troubles offensively. That was evident even in the central sequence of the game, just before McCluster\u2019s backbreaking punt return.         \n\nIt was still a 10-7 game late in the third quarter as the Giants tried to move the ball from deep in their own territory. On second-and-7, Manning completed a 16-yard pass along the sideline to Hakeem Nicks, who had dropped passes from Manning earlier. This time, Nicks pulled the ball in before being knocked out at the 40. But as so often has happened to the Giants this year, an important gain was negated by a holding penalty, this time on left tackle Will Beatty.
