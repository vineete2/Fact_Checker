{"headline": "Kansas\u2019 Governor and G.O.P. Seek to End Income Tax", "body": "\nTOPEKA, Kan. \u2014 President Obama stood on the steps of the Capitol in Washington on Monday afternoon and laid out an expansive liberal agenda for the nation. Inside the Kansas State Capitol here this week, Gov.  \n and Republican legislators have been drafting what could be a blueprint for the other side.         \n\nOn Wednesday, lawmakers received a bill to inch the state closer to eliminating income taxes, a centerpiece of a broad legislative vision that many in the Republican Party here hope will serve as a model of conservative governance for other states, if not the nation, to follow.         \n\nWhile Republican principles of small government and low taxes have holds on large swaths of the country, Kansas provides perhaps the starkest view of the crimson ideology that could challenge Mr. Obama\u2019s Inauguration Day rallying cry.         \n\nThis month, the largest tax cut in Kansas history took effect, and most of its  \n system was handed over to private insurers. The bill introduced this week would pare taxes further, with the goal of eventually eliminating the state\u2019s individual income tax. Mr. Brownback has already slashed the state\u2019s welfare roll and its work force. He has merged government agencies and is proposing further consolidation. He is pushing for pension changes, to change the way judges are selected and for altering education financing formulas.         \n\n\u201cI think it is the leading edge of the conservative economic and political movement,\u201d said State Representative Tom Sloan, a Republican representing the area around Lawrence. \u201cAs such, it is the example that other state leaders will look to to determine whether the political philosophy can mesh with the expectations of the public.\u201d         \n\nIn last year\u2019s elections, the state bucked its long tradition of moderate Republicanism. Conservatives ousted several moderates in Senate primary contests and went on to victory in November. Now, for the first time in generations, the House, the Senate and the governor\u2019s office in Kansas are controlled by conservative Republicans. In much of the rest of the country, the political equation is similar: The Republican Party now controls both legislative chambers and governorships in 24 states. Democrats have single-party control in 13.         \n\nMany here, including the governor, have characterized the state\u2019s legislative endeavors as an experiment. Mr. Brownback, elected in 2010, and his supporters are betting that their agenda will show the rest of the country that conservatism provides a path to economic prosperity.         \n\n\u201cI think the unique thing is that we\u2019re applying the principles on how you get your cost down and still provide a high-quality product,\u201d Mr. Brownback said in an interview. \u201cThat\u2019s been in the private sector, but it hasn\u2019t been in the public sector for 50 years.\u201d         \n\nSkeptics, meanwhile, contend that Mr. Brownback is leading Kansas toward economic devastation that will leave many of the state\u2019s residents without basic services and its children without a proper education.         \n\n\u201cIt kind of eliminates a large group of Kansans out of that pursuit of happiness,\u201d Senator Oletha Faust-Goudeau, a Wichita Democrat, said of the governor\u2019s proposals. \u201cThey will still struggle. They\u2019ll pay the highest taxes. They are already working jobs with no benefits or very little benefits.\u201d         \n\nRepresentative Barbara Bollier, a Republican representing the suburbs of Kansas City, questioned why the state was cutting taxes at a time of sagging revenues. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond extremely conservative because no one else is doing it,\u201d she said.         \n\nLegislation passed last year that took effect this month consolidated three income tax brackets into two (4.9 percent and 3 percent). It also eliminated taxes on nonwage profits for certain types of businesses.         \n\nSupporters said these measures were necessary to reverse years of economic stagnation. Private-sector jobs have grown just 1.6 percent in the state over the past 14 years, compared with 12.2 percent in the 10 states with the lowest tax burdens, according to data compiled by the Kansas Policy Institute. The state estimates that the tax cuts will generate nearly 23,000 jobs by 2020 and $2 billion of income for the state.
