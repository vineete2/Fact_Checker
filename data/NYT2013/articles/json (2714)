{"headline": "Yankees\u2019 Dim Playoff Hopes Flicker Out", "body": "\nThere was a somber inevitability Wednesday night in the Bronx: from the brief pregame ceremony honoring Andy Pettitte to Tampa Bay\u2019s crushing back-to-back home runs in the sixth inning to the decisive final out, which actually came more than 400 miles away in Cleveland.         \n\nThe Yankees\u2019 quest to win another World Series fell terribly short as they lost, 8-3, to the  \n. But even before the Yankees and the Rays moved to the ninth inning of their game, the Yankees were officially eliminated \u2014 about 10:16 p.m., when the Indians concluded their 7-2 victory over the Chicago White Sox, as the scoreboard in center field showed for all at Yankee Stadium to see.         \n\nWith four games remaining, the Yankees have 82 wins, and the Indians have 88.         \n\n\u201cWhen you are out before the postseason even starts,\u201d Manager Joe Girardi said, \u201cit\u2019s extremely disappointing.\u201d         \n\nIt is only the second time in the last 19 years that the  \n have not qualified for the postseason. Since 1995, qualifying had seemed almost automatic. Not in 2013, though, for a team with too many injuries and aging veterans.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating,\u201d Robinson Cano said. \u201cWe were close, but we didn\u2019t make the playoffs. At the same time, we have to be, not satisfied, but at least we got this far because we didn\u2019t have most of the guys most of the season. It was close, but there is nothing else you can do.\u201d         \n\nThe Yankees, typical of their recent form, could muster little offense against the left-hander David Price, and the Rays delivered the decisive blows when Evan Longoria hit a three-run homer off reliever David Huff and David DeJesus followed with a shot to right field. The fans at Yankee Stadium, perhaps numbed by the inevitable, watched in near silence.         \n\nThe Yankees last failed to make the playoffs in 2008. In 2009, they rebounded with a flourish, spending lavishly in the off-season and winning the World Series. There is little to suggest that pattern will hold this year, with the Yankees professing a new frugality. But many changes are probable.         \n\nSome players could leave through free agency, others are aging and facing an uncertain future, two are retiring, and Alex Rodriguez is facing a season-long suspension for allegations that he used performance-enhancing drugs.         \n\nRodriguez, who is also dealing with fragile legs, was removed in the eighth inning.         \n\n\u201cHe told me his legs weren\u2019t great, and he said he was going to go take care of them,\u201d Girardi said. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018O.K., go take care of them.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nBoth Pettitte and Mariano Rivera have announced they will retire after the season. Pettitte was scheduled to start Friday in Houston, near his hometown, against the Astros, his former team, and Rivera will probably pitch Thursday in his last game at Yankee Stadium. But it is not the way Rivera wanted to end his career.         \n\n\u201cTo say goodbye to the fans, but it doesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not used to pitching for something that doesn\u2019t mean anything. I want to pitch in something that means something. But the fans to me are special, and I\u2019ll be there tomorrow.\u201d         \n\nSeveral other key players, like Cano, Curtis Granderson, Hiroki Kuroda, Boone Logan and Phil Hughes, are eligible for free agency and may end their Yankees careers in unusual fashion \u2014 playing in meaningless games.         \n\nHughes in particular was a disappointment. Pitching Wednesday in what was probably his last game as a Yankee, he had a performance characteristic of his dreadful season. Hughes, who is 4-14 with a 5.19 earned run average, gave up three runs and seven hits in two-plus innings.         \n\nHe was removed in the third with the bases loaded, a sour expression on his face as he made what could have been his final walk to the Yankees\u2019 dugout.         \n\n\u201cIn a game we absolutely had to win, it\u2019s tough to leave that way,\u201d he said.         \n\nThis season was a challenging one for the entire team, starting in spring training, when Derek Jeter and Rodriguez were sidelined with serious leg injuries. Jeter, who broke his ankle in the playoffs last year, played only 17 games in a season he described as \u201ca nightmare.\u201d He sustained two other muscle injuries and was shut down for good with pain in his injured ankle.         \n\nRodriguez returned from hip surgery on Aug. 5 and hit seven home runs, including a grand slam last week. But his batting average declined over the last two weeks, and on Wednesday, the booing he faced earlier this season returned.         \n\nMark Teixeira and Granderson were injured in spring training, only to return and be injured again. Kevin Youkilis, Brett Gardner, Travis Hafner, Francisco Cervelli and Jayson Nix were also victims of injuries.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a frustrating year, and we fought hard,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cIt\u2019s not from a lack of trying, guys not playing hard, guys not wanting it. It was just that some teams are better than us, we didn\u2019t play well, and we got beat.\u201d         \n\nThe Yankees did remain viable until the final week of the season. But in the end they could not compete with teams like the Rays, teams that still have hopes of making the playoffs and even the World Series. For the Yankees, now, that is but a distant dream.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely disappointing,\u201d Girardi said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s back to the drawing board.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/26/sports/baseball/yankees-fail-to-make-playoffs-lose-to-rays.html", "date": "2013-09-25", "description": "For only the second time in the last 19 years, the Yankees were eliminated from playoff contention on a night they were unable to muster enough offense against the Rays."}
