Conservatives and other opponents of the current version of affirmative action vowed to use the court\u2019s ruling as a road map to bring future cases.         \n\n \n joined by the four members of the court\u2019s conservative wing \u2014 Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. \u2014 and two of its liberals, Justices Stephen G. Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor.         \n\nOnly Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented, writing that lower courts were correct to uphold the Texas program. Justice Elena Kagan disqualified herself from the case, presumably because she had worked on it as solicitor general in the Obama administration.         \n\nThe decision did not disturb the Supreme Court\u2019s general approach to affirmative action in admissions decisions, saying that educational diversity is an interest sufficient to overcome the general ban on racial classifications by the government. But the court added that public institutions must have good reasons for the particular methods they use to achieve that goal.         \n\nColleges and universities, Justice Kennedy wrote for the majority, must demonstrate that \u201cavailable, workable race-neutral alternatives do not suffice\u201d before taking account of race in admissions decisions.         \n\nThat requirement could endanger the Texas program when it is reconsidered by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans. The university\u2019s program admits most undergraduates under race-neutral criteria,  \n. But the university also uses a race-conscious system to choose the remaining students.         \n\nCourts reviewing government programs that make distinctions based on race subject them to a form of judicial review known as \u201cstrict scrutiny,\u201d requiring the government to identify an important goal and a close fit between means and ends. Justice Kennedy\u2019s opinion focused on and tightened the second part of the test.         \n\n\u201cStrict scrutiny,\u201d Justice Kennedy wrote, \u201cdoes not permit a court to accept a school\u2019s assertion that its admissions process uses race in a permissible way without a court giving close analysis to the evidence of how the process works in practice.\u201d         \n\nCourts reviewing affirmative action programs must, he wrote, \u201cverify that it is necessary for a university to use race to achieve the educational benefits of diversity.\u201d That requires, he said, \u201ca careful judicial inquiry into whether a university could achieve sufficient diversity without using racial classifications.\u201d         \n\nJustice Ginsburg, who announced her dissent from the bench, said the race-neutral part of the Texas program worked only because of \u201cde facto racial segregation in Texas\u2019 neighborhoods and schools.\u201d         \n\nThe case, Fisher v. University of Texas, No. 11-345, arose from a lawsuit filed by a white woman, Abigail Fisher, who said the university had denied her admission based on her race.         \n\nIn a statement issued Monday, Ms. Fisher said she was \u201cgrateful to the justices for moving the nation closer to the day when a student\u2019s race isn\u2019t used at all in college admissions.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/25/us/affirmative-action-decision.html", "date": "2013-06-24", "description": "The 7-to-1 ruling was both modest and significant, and its recalibration of how courts review the programs is likely to give rise to a wave of challenges to college admissions decisions."}
