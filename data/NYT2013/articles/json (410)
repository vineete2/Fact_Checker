{"headline": "Assange, Back in News, Never Left U.S. Radar", "body": "\nIn June 2011, Ogmundur Jonasson, Iceland\u2019s minister of the interior at the time, received an urgent message from the authorities in the United States. It said that \u201cthere was an imminent attack on Icelandic government databases\u201d by hackers, and that the F.B.I. would send agents to investigate, Mr. Jonasson said in a telephone interview.         \n\nBut when \u201ceight or nine\u201d F.B.I. agents arrived in August, Mr. Jonasson said, he found that they were not investigating an imminent attack, but gathering material on  \n, the activist group that has been responsible for publishing millions of confidential documents over the past three years, and that has many operatives in Iceland.         \n\nMr. Jonasson asked the agents to leave, he said, because they had misrepresented the purpose of their visit.         \n\nThe operation in Iceland was part of a wide-ranging investigation into WikiLeaks and its founder,  \n, for their roles in the release of American military and diplomatic documents in 2010. The investigation has been quietly gathering material since at least October 2010, six months after the arrest of Pfc.  \n, the army enlistee who is accused of providing the bulk of the leaks.         \n\nUntil he re-emerged this week as an ally for Edward J. Snowden, the former computer contractor who leaked details of  \n surveillance, Mr. Assange looked like a forgotten man. WikiLeaks had not had a major release of information in several years, its funds had dwindled and several senior architects of its systems left, citing internal disputes. Mr. Assange himself is holed up in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, where he fled to avoid extradition to Sweden for questioning on allegations of sexual abuse.         \n\nBut the United States government had not forgotten about him. Interviews with government agents, prosecutors and others familiar with the WikiLeaks investigation, as well as an examination of court documents, suggest that Mr. Assange and WikiLeaks are being investigated by several government agencies, along with a grand jury that has subpoenaed witnesses.         \n\nTens of thousands of pages of evidence have been gathered. And at least four other former members of WikiLeaks have had contact with the United States authorities seeking information on Mr. Assange, the former members said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a matter they were informed was confidential.         \n\nIn response to recent questions from The New York Times and others, a Justice Department spokesman confirmed that it \u201chas an investigation into matters involving WikiLeaks, and that investigation remains ongoing,\u201d but he declined to offer any details.         \n\nThe prosecution of WikiLeaks would put the administration into tricky legal territory. WikiLeaks is an international organization, and, unlike Private Manning and Mr. Snowden, Mr. Assange and the other members did not work for the United States government or its contractors and could not be charged with espionage.         \n\nWikiLeaks maintains it was functioning as a publisher by enabling the release of information in the public interest, and it has frequently been a partner with traditional news organizations, including The New York Times and The Guardian. If the government charged WikiLeaks and Mr. Assange as co-conspirators, it would be arguing that, unlike their partners, they are not journalists.         \n\n\u201cGiven the government\u2019s aggression in the Snowden case, I would expect that the government will continue to move forward with the Assange case on a conspiracy theory, even though WikiLeaks would seem eligible for First Amendment protections,\u201d said James C. Goodale, a First Amendment lawyer who previously worked for The Times and is the author of \u201cFighting for the Press.\u201d         \n\nHe added that no reporter had ever been successfully prosecuted on a conspiracy charge but that recent actions, like the investigation of a Fox News reporter, James Rosen, was evidence that the\u00a0 government was \u201cmoving toward criminalizing the reporting process.\u201d         \n\nThe Times has never been contacted as part of a WikiLeaks investigation, said David E. McCraw, its assistant general counsel. \u201cBut I would note that the proposed shield law,\u201d he said, describing new legislation that the administration says is an effort to shield journalists from prosecution, \u201ctries to define Wiki-like publishers out of the definition of news organizations.\u201d         \n\nMr. Assange declined to be interviewed, but said in a statement to The Times that the Justice Department \u201cand its accompanying F.B.I. investigation are blinded by their zeal to get rid of publishers who speak truth to power.         \n\n\u201cThey believe U.S. agencies can flout laws, coerce people into becoming informants, steal our property and detain our alleged sources without trial,\u201d the statement added.         \n\nThe investigation has largely been carried out in secret, as most are, but a few clues have emerged. In December 2010, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia  \n for Private Manning, Mr. Assange and Birgitta Jonsdottir, a former WikiLeaks activist and now a member of Iceland\u2019s Parliament, among others.         \n\nA redacted version of the subpoena served on Ms. Jonsdottir cited a specific conspiracy provision that may have been aimed at those thought to have assisted Private Manning.
