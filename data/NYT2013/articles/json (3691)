{"headline": "Israel Tightens Border Defense as Syria Erupts", "body": "\nMOUNT HAZEKA, Israel \u2014 Elite infantry and reconnaissance units have been moved into the long-quiet  \n this spring. Bulldozers are making way for new military shelters. And at an Israeli Army outpost on a strategic hilltop here, a Merkava tank sits pointing toward  \n \u2014 poised to race up a dirt ramp at a moment\u2019s notice.         \n\nThe stepped-up military presence across the 43-mile border demonstrates the growing fear and anxiety among Israeli leaders over the Syrian civil war. Already there have been clashes at the border, with errant munitions landing in the Golan some 30 times, at least five prompting Israel to fire back.         \n\nAn Obama administration official said Friday night that Israeli aircraft bombed a target in Syria overnight on Thursday, and United States officials said they  \n, including carrying out their own airstrikes.         \n\nBut the concern in Israel runs deeper along what was for decades one border it did not have to worry much about. Many increasingly see no possible positive outcome of their neighbor\u2019s bloody conflict, no clear solution for securing their interests in the meanwhile. Israel\u2019s military leadership now views southern Syria as an \u201cungoverned area\u201d that poses imminent danger.         \n\n\u201cThis is the new reality of the Golan Heights,\u201d Brig. Gen. Gal Hirsch, an active reservist who is deputy commander of a unit focused on long-range operations in enemy territory, said as he stood near the Merkava tank positioned here. \u201cInside the bush, we have units that are ready to jump and open fire. You can see here tanks, you can see forces \u2014 and there are many things you cannot see.\u201d         \n\nFor Israel, as for other nations, the Syrian civil war presents pressing security challenges, including the prospect of chemical and other sophisticated weapons falling into the hands of rogue groups, and radical Islamists ultimately coming to power. But speaking to members of Parliament from his faction this week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signaled a new focus, saying, \u201cThe first and primary threat is an attack on our citizens and soldiers from the Golan Heights line.\u201d         \n\nAnd so, as Israel is building up its defense here, the nation is debating a longer-term approach, a prospect complicated and made more urgent by recent troubles along the border with Egypt, which had also been relatively quiet, until the overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak two years ago.         \n\nSome analysts in Israel and abroad have raised the possibility of  \n, similar to what it did beginning in the 1970s with the South Lebanon Army. Though the Lebanese strategy was largely seen as having backfired by fomenting the emergence of Hezbollah, Mr. Netanyahu fueled that speculation when he declined in a recent  \n to confirm or deny whether Israel would arm Syrian rebels.         \n\nOthers have suggested a force of Israeli citizens, perhaps made up of Druse who live in the Golan and are of Syrian origin, amassing in the buffer zone long patrolled by 1,000 United Nations peacekeepers. That force is itself in turmoil, with two nations having withdrawn their troops since December, and  \n.         \n\nBut top military and political officials in recent interviews said neither was on the table, revealing Israel\u2019s quandary: despite what it considers mounting threats, Israel sees large-scale intervention as problematic. \u201cIn so many cases,\u201d one Israeli general said in an interview last month, speaking on the condition he not be named, \u201cwe can be the sous chef, not the chef.\u201d         \n\nIsrael and Syria are in a technical state of war, but have maintained an uneasy calm since 1974 along the Golan Heights, which Israel seized in 1967 and much of the world considers occupied territory. With Syria now unraveling,  \n, with some privately suggesting the best circumstances might be for the conflict to continue so enemies including Iran and Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite militia, are occupied elsewhere.         \n\nIsrael is wary of many of the rebel groups challenging the Syrian president,  \n, because of their affiliations with Al Qaeda and jihadists, and worries that its vast neighbor will break up into fiefs far more likely to launch attacks than a centralized state.         \n\nZalman Shoval, a former Israeli ambassador to the United States, invoked what he said was a Hebrew saying to sum up Israel\u2019s options: \u201cBetween cholera and the plague.\u201d And Dore Gold, a longtime diplomat who now heads the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, said, \u201cThe choices facing Israel are not good.\u201d         \n\n\u201cAll you can do,\u201d Mr. Gold said, \u201cis make sure you make clear to all parties around you that you\u2019ll do what\u2019s necessary to exercise your right to self-defense.\u201d         \n\nThe Israeli newspaper Maariv reported this week that a military post near the critical junction of Israel\u2019s borders with Syria and Jordan was reopened after having been shuttered for years.         \n\nGeneral Hirsch, leading a border tour for journalists through closed military zones on Thursday, said troops have not only multiplied across the Golan, but heightened their levels of alert. Late last year, Israel also began building a 16-foot steel obstacle equipped with sophisticated sensors and intelligence equipment behind the rusted, sagging, chest-high fence along the 43-mile border. It is scheduled to be completed in August.         \n\n\u201cWe want to make sure nobody will be able to penetrate from Syria to our territory for any purpose,\u201d General Hirsch said as workers added circles of razor wire to the top two-thirds of the intimidating silver rebar wall and readied some areas for a concrete foundation.         \n\n\u201cThe tanks were always ready behind,\u201d he added, \u201cbut now they are along the line, ready to fire.\u201d         \n\nDespite the increased military activity and new soundtrack of Syrian bombing, life in the Golan Heights, a lush, hilly, 444-square-mile swath of vineyards and orchards that is home to 43,000 Israelis, about half of them Druse, has not changed much. The Golan Tourism Association said it has received numerous inquiries about the Syrian situation but has seen no drop-off in the three million annual visitors since the conflict began. Local Druse continue to export apples to Syria, some 7,000 tons so far in 2013, on pace with the 18,000 sent in recent years.         \n\nIn Alonei Habashan, the community of 57 religious Jewish families just behind the Israeli military post here that has been hit by Syrian shells several times, children continue to go to school and roam freely, according to Yael Saperia, a lawyer and mother of seven who has lived there 25 years. They have grown used to the sounds of war.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of become the background noise; we don\u2019t even pay attention to it anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cOn Shabbat we hear it, mostly, because it\u2019s quiet.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/04/world/middleeast/syrias-unrest-puts-israelis-on-alert.html", "date": "2013-05-03", "description": "Errant munitions from Syria\u2019s conflict have landed in the Golan Heights some 30 times.
