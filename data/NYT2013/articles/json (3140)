{"headline": "Two Artists Make Cash\u2019s \u2018Folsom Prison Blues\u2019 Their Own", "body": "\n \n         \n\nI have three takes on the country singer Johnny Cash\u2019s signature song \u201cFolsom Prison Blues,\u201d and they couldn\u2019t be more different.  \n, Seattle\u2019s alt-country folk-rock singer-songwriter, and  \n Nashville\u2019s contemporary-blues \u201cfolk-soul\u201d artist, give us covers that take Cash\u2019s classic and make it their own. The song is more than 50 years old, you Cash fans have listened to it a million times, but the contemporary artists give us new twists by adding twang, a yodel, a slide guitar and tempo changes. Cash\u2019s hit brings to mind old folk-genres of \u201ctrain\u201d and \u201cprison\u201d song. Ms. Carlile and Keb\u2019 Mo\u2019, who have vast catalogs of original music as well, can\u2019t be pigeonholed in a single genre. They both tour and I highly recommend catching them if they come to your town.         \nJohnny Cash-Folsom Prison Blues-Live@SanQuentin State Prison \nBrandi Carlile - Folsom Prison Blues \nKeb' Mo' - Folsom Prison Blues (Akileze Studios) \n\n \n         \n\n \n (video, with still photo)         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/24/booming/two-artists-make-cashs-folsom-prison-blues-their-own.html", "date": "2013-09-24", "description": "Brandi Carlile, out of Seattle and Keb\u2019 Mo\u2019, out of Nashville, add fresh twists on Johnny Cash\u2019s signature song."}
