{"headline": "New Neighbor\u2019s Agenda: White Power Takeover", "body": "\nLEITH, N.D. \u2014 The bearded man with thinning, gray-and-bleach-blond hair flapping down his neck first appeared in this tiny agricultural town last year, quietly and inconspicuously roaming the crackly dirt roads.         \n\nNettie Ketterling thought nothing of it when he came into her bar to charge his cellphone in an outlet beneath the mounted head of a mule deer. To Kenneth Zimmerman, the man was just another customer, bringing his blue Dodge Durango in for repairs. Bobby Harper did not blink when the man appeared in front of his house and asked him if he had any land to sell. And the mayor, Ryan Schock, was simply extending a civic courtesy when he swung by the man\u2019s house to introduce himself.         \n\nTheir new neighbor, they thought, was just another person looking to get closer to the  \n known as the Bakken.         \n\nBut all that changed last week.         \n\nThe  \n and  \n revealed that the man, Paul Craig Cobb, 61, has been buying up property in this town of 24 people in an effort to transform it into a colony for white supremacists.         \n\nIn the past two years, Mr. Cobb, a longtime proselytizer for white supremacy who is wanted in Canada on charges of promoting hatred, has bought a dozen plots of land in Leith (pronounced Leeth) and has sold or transferred ownership of some of them to a couple of like-minded white nationalists.         \n\nHe is using Craigslist and white power message boards to entice others in the movement to take refuge in Leith, about two hours southwest of Bismarck. On one board, he detailed his vision for the community \u2014 an enclave where residents fly \u201cracialist\u201d banners, where they are able to import enough \u201cresponsible hard core\u201d white nationalists to take control of the town government, where \u201cleftist journalists or antis\u201d who \u201ccome and try to make trouble\u201d will face arrest.         \n\nThe revelations have riveted this community and the surrounding area, drawing a range of reactions from disgust to disbelief to curiosity.         \n\n\u201cIf that man wanted to live in Leith and be a good neighbor and be decent and not push his thoughts on the people, then he could live there,\u201d said Arlene Wells, 82, a farmer and local historian. \u201cBut to come in and want to change everything and be the big dog \u2014 no. I don\u2019t like bulldogs.\u201d         \n\nIt is all people are talking about, in bars and in their homes, at funerals and at church. They are poking around on the Web to read Mr. Cobb\u2019s positions for themselves. A stream of cars creep through the streets where horses occasionally trot, their passengers hoping to catch a glimpse of some action or take a peek at Mr. Cobb\u2019s peeling, two-story clapboard home. Sheriff\u2019s cars, too, are making more rounds.         \n\nThis is not how residents wanted Leith to get back on the map. Founded in 1909, the town bustled in the middle of the century, a regional center for festivals, movies and skating. The population began slipping after peaking at 174 in 1930, but the death knell was the closing of the railroad some 30 years ago. Though the 2010 census said the population is 16, Mr. Schock puts it at 24, and the Leith Bar is the only one of the five remaining buildings on Main Street still open. Most lots are empty and overgrown, laden with high-flying grasshoppers, in this town that sits in a bowl surrounded by wheat and sunflower fields.         \n\nMr. Cobb happened upon the community, he said, through an ad for the home he eventually bought on Craigslist. He paid a total of about $8,600 for the house and 12 plots, he said, making his first purchases in 2011. He moved here in May 2012, he said, after fleeing Canada in 2010 to avoid the criminal charges. He spent some time in Montana, before coming to North Dakota to find work in the oil patch. He said he lost his construction job last week after the story broke.         \n\nPeople have knocked on Mr. Cobb\u2019s red door to offer to buy back his land and to preach the Gospel. The City Council is looking into potential ordinance or health code violations (his home has no septic tank or running water). There is a doomsday plan in place, Mr. Schock explained: If enough of Mr. Cobb\u2019s friends move in to gain a majority that could vote out the current government, the Council would immediately dissolve the town.         \n\nMr. Harper, Leith\u2019s only black resident, said a lot of people approached him at his mother-in-law\u2019s funeral on Monday to tell him they had his back.         \n\n\u201cPeople told me to leave town for the weekend and they\u2019d take care of everything,\u201d he said.         \n\nBut he and his wife, Sherrill \u2014 who found herself referred to as a \u201cfilthy race-mixing white woman\u201d in one of Mr. Cobb\u2019s online posts \u2014 said they were not going anywhere.         \n\nMr. Cobb, meanwhile, seems to be soaking in the publicity and mocking it.
