{"headline": "Wines to Pair With Those Whole Grain Salads", "body": "\nThough each of these recipes is based on a different grain, the particular grains are essentially irrelevant to selecting wines. They simply form neutral bases for more forceful flavorings, so examine those when you are deciding on particular bottles.         \n\nFarro ni\u00e7oise, like its sister salade ni\u00e7oise, gravitates naturally toward a Proven\u00e7al ros\u00e9, perhaps from Cassis. That\u2019s easy. Millet with corn, mango and shrimp suggests a New World chardonnay, though one with a firm spine of acidity and minimal oak. A good ros\u00e9 wouldn\u2019t be a bad option, either. The third recipe is the trickiest: coconut, coconut milk, curry powder, lime juice and cilantro all suggest Asian, but olive oil, chickpeas and carrot muddle the message. My inclination is a German riesling, perhaps kabinett or sp\u00e4tlese, as a slight sweetness might unite these disparate flavors.\u00a0        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/24/dining/wines-to-pair-with-those-whole-grain-salads.html", "date": "2013-07-23", "description": "The grains simply form neutral bases for more forceful flavorings."}
