{"headline": "Financing Start-Up Dreams With Retirement Savings", "body": "\nBOHNNE JONES had always dreamed of being an architect or interior designer. Suzie Ford wanted to know if the home-brewed beer her husband, Todd, made was as good as people said it was, while Jan Morris figured owning a distillery would be more fun than being a divorce lawyer.         \n\nThey had three very different dreams, but these women had one thing in common: they all lost jobs and decided to use sizable retirement accounts to start their own businesses in very different fields. They did so by converting traditional 401(k) accounts into new retirement plans \u2014 known as \u201crollovers as business start-ups,\u201d or ROBS \u2014 that they could invest in their companies.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fueled by the fact that stock market has returned to all-time highs, real estate is up, consumer confidence is up \u2014 but we\u2019re also suffering from a credit crisis, and unemployment remains high,\u201d said David Nilssen, chief executive of  \n, which specializes in helping people use 401(k) assets to invest in businesses or other nontraditional assets, like property. \u201cPeople look at this because they can capitalize a business without taking on any debt.\u201d         \n\nWhile this may sound like an easy solution to finance a company, it is incredibly complicated, and the risks of running afoul of the Internal Revenue Service or the Department of Labor, which has jurisdiction over 401(k) plans, are significant. The worst possible outcome is a triple-whammy loss of a person\u2019s retirement savings, the business and a source of income if the idea fails.         \n\nAdding to the complications, ROBS exist in a parallel financial universe, where those who promote the plans see them as solutions for retirement-rich but cash-poor entrepreneurs, while many other financial advisers see the plans as treading the line of legality.         \n\n\u201cThe I.R.S. has said that they don\u2019t view them as tax-avoidance schemes per se,\u201d said Carol J. Ventura, retirement specialist at  \n, a broker-dealer with $33 billion under management. \u201cThey\u2019re not illegal, but the I.R.S. is saying that they have to be perfectly put in place. They\u2019re very complicated.\u201d         \n\nFailure to do everything right could lead to anything from penalties to having the entire retirement plan disallowed, which would mean a big tax bill.         \n\nStill, Mr. Nilssen said the idea had been gaining in popularity. He said his company had its best year in 2012 with 1,300 new ROBS and expects to do 1,700 this year. I wanted to know what the attraction was to something that seemed so complicated and magnified the sizable risk of starting any business.         \n\n \n People take their 401(k) account (or other qualified retirement plan) and roll it over into a new plan that buys shares in an operating company that will own their business. Unlike most small businesses, which are set up as limited liability corporations or S-corporations, a business financed through ROBS has to be a C-corporation, which can issue shares and does not prohibit ownership by trusts.         \n\nIn many cases, people turn to ROBS because they don\u2019t have other sources of financing and have not been able to secure a small-business loan.The companies of the people I spoke to were owned by anywhere from 90 percent of one person\u2019s 401(k) to 100 percent of two entire plans.         \n\nThat might sound simple, but what effectively happens is that the plan, not the person, owns the business. That means the person cannot act in his best interest but must act in the best interest of the plan. For example, if he wants to give himself a raise, he needs to find out what similar business owners make.         \n\n\u201cI have counseled people on how to do them correctly and then I typically say, \u2018I find it to be a bad idea and you\u2019re probably going to get yourself in trouble,\u2019 \u201d said Bill Smith, a tax lawyer and managing director in the \n \u201cThe I.R.S. is not consistent on what it considers correct. It\u2019s very easy to mess these things up.\u201d         \n\nMr. Nilssen said Guidant helped people set up the initial plan and managed the reporting requirements. He said that of his firm\u2019s 8,500 clients, about 50 had been audited, but none had had action taken against them.         \n\nMs. Jones said that in the course of putting $260,000 of the $340,000 she had in her retirement account into buying a Decorating Den franchise in Nashville, she had several lean years during the recession, but that she is now doing well. She says she is also happier than when she was working in health care technology.         \n\nBut she said the paperwork to comply with the I.R.S. rules could be complicated \u2014 and managing paperwork was part of her previous career. One requirement of these plans is that she and any employees pay into the 401(k) set up to buy the company. \u201cThat check has to be out the door seven days after payroll,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I\u2019m late at writing a check to deposit my 401(k) money, there are penalties, and I\u2019ve paid penalties.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/14/your-money/financing-start-up-dreams-with-retirement-savings.html", "date": "2013-09-13", "description": "You can use 401(k) money to create a new business, but beware: the rules are complicated and the Internal Revenue Service will be watching closely."}
