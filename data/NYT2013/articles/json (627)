{"headline": "Jets\u2019 Aboushi Faces Aspersions for Being Palestinian", "body": "\nOn the night of June 29, two months after he was drafted by  \n, Oday Aboushi stood before more than 700 people at the El Bireh Society convention in Arlington, Va., and discussed his journey to the N.F.L.         \n\nAboushi shared what it was like growing up in Brooklyn and Staten Island as one of 10 children. He spoke about graduating from the University of Virginia in three and a half years. He discussed his 2009 visit to refugee camps in the West Bank, how that trip inspired him even more to succeed and to represent his community.         \n\n\u201cIt was the classic American success story,\u201d said Sarab Al-Jijakli, the president of the Network of Arab-American Professionals, who was in the audience that night.         \n\nAboushi\u2019s appearance at the convention, a three-day gathering of  \n-Americans that was described by another attendee as a \u201ccultural networking event,\u201d produced an outcry from some online who charged Aboushi with being a Muslim extremist. An article on the Web site FrontPage Mag suggested that he had terrorist ties. A column on Yahoo Sports, since removed, said he held anti-Semitic views. An employee of MLB.com on Twitter compared Aboushi to Aaron Hernandez, the former New England Patriots tight end charged with murder, before later apologizing.         \n\nWaves of support for Aboushi started rolling in on Thursday, and on Friday, the Anti-Defamation League released a statement condemning the attacks on his character and applauding him for taking pride in his culture. The Jets also backed Aboushi, an offensive lineman they selected in the fifth round.         \n\nIn a statement, Aboushi said he was upset that his reputation had been tarnished by people who did not know him, but that he was proud of his Palestinian heritage and to have been born and raised in the United States.         \n\n\u201cOur judgment here was that he was falsely accused of being what he\u2019s not, and the next thing to do is stand up and say so,\u201d Abraham H. Foxman, the national director of the Anti-Defamation League, said in a telephone interview. He added: \u201cThere are two Israeli players in the N.B.A., and they stand up and affirm their Israeli identity. That doesn\u2019t make them anti-Palestinian. He\u2019s proud of his heritage, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\u201d         \n\nThe politics of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are fraught, and that tension \u2014 more than anything he has said or done \u2014 seems to have thrust Aboushi into this furor. It is, perhaps, part of being a Palestinian-American athlete, a relative rarity, although his family is not willing to accept it.         \n\n\u201cOur family\u2019s never experienced anything like this, and I mean anything,\u201d Tahanie Aboushi, one of Oday\u2019s sisters, said in a phone interview. She said Aboushi had maintained a positive attitude despite criticism that felt like \u201cpure venom.\u201d \u00a0         \n\nTahanie said her parents, Eman and Ahmad, immigrated from Beit Hanina, a Palestinian section of the occupied territory in East Jerusalem, about 40 years ago. They ran a grocery store in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, and Aboushi lived on 53rd Street in that neighborhood before moving about a decade ago to Huguenot, Staten Island. Aboushi, the ninth of 10 children, was raised mostly by his mother and his older siblings. His father has spent more than a decade in federal prison after being convicted of conspiracy to commit robbery, conspiracy to possess stolen property, theft from interstate shipment and transportation of a stolen vehicle, according to federal court documents.         \n\nAboushi grew up in a home where Arabic was spoken as well as English. Like his three brothers, Aboushi, a practicing Muslim, attended Xaverian High School, a Catholic school in Brooklyn. Three of Aboushi\u2019s siblings, including Tahanie, are partners in the Aboushi Law Firm in Manhattan. Other siblings have worked in teaching, accounting and entrepreneurship, and have entered medical school.         \n\nLinda Sarsour, a close friend of the family\u2019s and the executive director of the Arab American Association of New York, described the Aboushis as active in civic engagement but \u201cin a behind-the-scenes, backstage\u201d kind of way. She said that one sister, Diane, was instrumental in raising money for Representative Andre Carson, Democrat of Indiana, and Representative Keith Ellison, Democrat of Minnesota, the first two Muslim members of Congress. Tahanie, a lawyer in Manhattan, is involved in New York\u2019s chapter of the Palestine Children\u2019s Relief Fund.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not activists that need to be in the limelight,\u201d Tahanie said. \u201cWe\u2019re not into being on stage unless it\u2019s required.         \n\n\u201cWe do what we need to get done, and we do it well.\u201d         \n\nIt was not required, then, that Aboushi speak at the El Bireh convention, but his family and friends viewed it as a great opportunity. The event reunites Palestinian-Americans from around the United States whose ancestors hailed from El Bireh, a village in the West Bank, for a few days of socializing and networking. Sarsour described it as \u201cvery secular.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a classy hangout in a Marriott,\u201d Tahanie said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a religious convention. It\u2019s not even a political convention.\u201d         \n\nSarsour said she was approached two months ago about Aboushi\u2019s speaking. The organizers, after realizing most of the people who had signed up were from ages 18 to 35, were looking for a successful Palestinian-American who could speak with the younger generation. Other speakers included Representative Nick Rahall, Democrat of West Virginia, and prominent members of the arts.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s similar to any other community, whether you\u2019re Latino or Colombian or Chinese; if you\u2019re someone who\u2019s accomplished, your community is very proud of you, and you take those platforms to show pride,\u201d Sarsour said. \u201cHe went to the conference as a Palestinian-American who plays professional football. He can\u2019t be anybody else but Palestinian. His name isn\u2019t Michael Smith. It\u2019s Oday Aboushi. It\u2019s not something he can stop being.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/13/sports/football/jets-aboushi-faces-aspersions-for-being-palestinian.html", "date": "2013-07-12", "description": "When the Jets\u2019 Oday Aboushi spoke about his Palestinian-American upbringing at a convention last month, he stirred an outcry online, with some alleging ties to terrorism."}
