{"headline": "My Manhattan Fantasies Realized. Sort Of.", "body": "\nA night that involved two Manhattan fantasies began with my wife and me and time to kill in the West Village. Last December we stopped into a bar to get a drink before meeting friends for dinner. The place was one of those meticulously set-designed mirages meant to evoke a speakeasy, lighted by softly glowing Art Deco fixtures. The drinks had names like Mata Hari and required muddled juniper berries.         \n\nSo there we were, having Mata Haris, when a mystery walked in: \u201c007\u2019s in the house,\u201d one bartender said. \u201cJames Bond\u2019s here,\u201d said another. A busboy with a curly mustache explained to a presumably newer colleague that the guest in question was \u201cundercover.\u201d         \n\nThe secret agent was an older black man wearing a long trench coat, a flat-brim cowboy hat, a purple turtleneck and glasses. He took a seat at the bar beside my wife. I\u2019d guess he was 65 or 70. He was smiling and laughing and hitting on every woman who walked by in an admirably unsleazy manner: \u201cYou got Elizabeth Taylor hair,\u201d he said. \u201cYou got Jackie Onassis eyes.\u201d Listening to him was like being transported to another, more innocently rakish era. The Mata Haris were working their magic.         \n\nI heard the man tell the bartender that he\u2019d recently been playing checkers with the saxophone genius Ornette Coleman.         \n\nI couldn\u2019t help myself. \u201cDid you say you played checkers with Ornette Coleman?\u201d I asked.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not all I played with him,\u201d the man said.         \n\nHe explained that he was a jazz pianist and that he\u2019d backed Miles, Coltrane, Mingus, Duke. \u201cBird,\u201d he said \u2014 referring to the best ever, Charlie Parker \u2014 \u201cI played with him too.\u201d         \n\nMy wife and I ordered more drinks. Dinner could wait.         \n\nThe man said his name was John. \u201cJohn what?\u201d I asked.         \n\n\u201cJohn Lewis.\u201d         \n\nIt\u2019s a boring name but an important one. John Lewis led the Modern Jazz Quartet for more than 40 years. The band never broke out much beyond jazz buffs, but to fans, the M.J.Q. remains a key outfit for pioneering a particularly graceful form of ensemble interplay. Bottom line: I was excited to meet the guy.         \n\nHe sprinkled his anecdotes with glamorous nostalgia. He talked of living among expat jazzmen in Zurich, knowing Billie Holiday, entertaining royalty. And when I told him his composition \u201cDjango\u201d was a favorite \u2014 only a slight fib on my part \u2014 he gave me a high five.         \n\nEventually my wife and I had to leave. I took down Lewis\u2019s number and told him I\u2019d buy him a drink the next time he was in town.         \n\nMy soul was swinging as we walked to the restaurant. \u201cHe\u2019s a really big deal in jazz,\u201d I said to my wife. \u201cHe\u2019s, like, one level down in fame from Miles Davis.\u201d         \n\nIt was near midnight when we got back to Brooklyn. I looked up John Lewis\u2019s Wikipedia page.         \n\nJohn Lewis died in 2001.         \n\nThe man at the bar had lied. But why? The impostor hadn\u2019t asked us for anything, not even a drink. I tried to catalog possible missed clues: If he lived in Switzerland, why did the bartenders react to him as if he were a regular? He said he spent time in Toronto with a young Oscar Peterson, but Peterson was from Montreal. And, most blatant, why would John Lewis, the real John Lewis, who would be in his 90s if he were not, in fact, dead, be drinking alone at a Manhattan bar on a Wednesday night?         \n\nHonestly, I wasn\u2019t upset or embarrassed at being duped. I was intrigued, almost more so than if it had actually been John Lewis charming us that night. That would have been a story. This was a riddle.         \n\nWeeks after the encounter, I sent the faker a text offering to buy him that drink. I wouldn\u2019t confront him \u2014 I was too curious about the deception to bring about its end. I wanted to know the truth of a life that resulted in that kind of lie. I got greedy.         \n\nNot-John-Lewis quickly returned my text. He planned to be at a lounge in the Flatiron district shortly and invited me along. I couldn\u2019t make it on such quick notice and asked if he was free another time.         \n\nHe never texted me back.         \n\nUltimately the stardust settled, and I decided against pursuing another meeting. The details might have made good cocktail-party fodder, but the motivation behind the deception was bound to be simple, as it always is. I suspect that an old man merely wanted to feel special. There\u2019s enough truth in that.
