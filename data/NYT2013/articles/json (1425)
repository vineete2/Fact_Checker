{"headline": "Battling College Costs, a Paycheck at a Time", "body": "\nIf Steve Boedefeld graduates from  \n without any student loan debt, it will be because of the money he earned fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan and the money he now saves by eating what he grows or kills.         \n\nZack Tolmie managed to escape  \n with no debt \u2014 and a degree \u2014 by landing a job at  \n, the brunch institution in TriBeCa, where he made $1,000 a week. And he had entered N.Y.U. with sophomore standing, thanks to Advanced Placement credits. All that hard work also yielded a $25,000 annual merit scholarship.         \n\nThe two are part of a rare species on college campuses these days, as the nation\u2019s collective student loan balance hits $1 trillion and continues to rise. While many students are trying to defray some of the costs, few can actually work their way through college in a normal amount of time without debt and little or no need-based financial aid unless they have an unusual combination of bravery, luck and discipline.         \n\n\u201cI literally never went out,\u201d Mr. Tolmie says. \u201cThere just was not time to do that.\u201d         \n\u201cI spent seven years getting my undergraduate degree and didn\u2019t borrow a dime of money.\u201d  \n of North Carolina, who heads a House subcommittee on higher education. \n\nPlenty of influential people assume that teenagers can ask parents for loans if all else fails, as  \n during the 2012 presidential campaign. Others recall working their way through college themselves, including Representative Virginia Foxx, a Republican from North Carolina who heads a House subcommittee on higher education and work force training. \u201cI spent seven years getting my undergraduate degree and didn\u2019t borrow a dime of money,\u201d  \n at a subcommittee meeting, adding that she was bewildered, given her own experience, by tales of woe she had heard from people with $80,000 in debt.         \n\nBut students nowadays who try to work their way through college without parental support or loans face a financial challenge of a different order than the one that Ms. Foxx, 69, confronted as a University of North Carolina undergraduate more than 40 years ago. Today, a bachelor\u2019s degree from Appalachian State, the largest university in her district, can easily cost $80,000 for a state resident, including tuition, room, board and other costs. Back in her day, the total was about $550 a year. Even with inflation, that would translate to just over $4,000 for each year it takes to earn a degree.         \n\nAnd the paychecks that Mr. Tolmie managed in the big city are only a dream in towns like Boone, where employers have their pick of thousands of Appalachian State undergraduates. Even the most industrious, like Kelsey Manuel, a junior who drives 10 miles each way to a job in a resort where she earns $10 to $11 an hour, often cannot work enough to finish college debt-free.         \n\nNo one tracks how many students are trying to work their way through without parental assistance or debt, but plenty work long hours while also attending classes full time. As of 2010, some 17 percent of full-time undergraduates of traditional age worked 20 to 34 hours a week, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. About 6 percent worked 35 hours or more.         \n\nStudents who work fewer than 30 hours a week (excluding federal work-study jobs) while in college were 1.4 times more likely to graduate within six years than students who spent more than 30 hours a week in a job, according to an article by Pilar Mendoza, an assistant professor of higher education administration at the University of Florida, in The Journal of Student Financial Aid last year. Their grades are likely to be better, too, since they have more time to study.         \n\nBut working less has financial consequences. \u201cYou have two choices,\u201d Ms. Mendoza says of students whose families could not or would not contribute to their college costs. \u201cYou either work, or you acquire debt.\u201d         \n\n \n         \nZack Tolmie paid for much of his education at New York University by working as a waiter in TriBeCa. \n\nZack Tolmie chose to work. He first caught sight of New York University on television when he was a freshman in high school in Altamont, N.Y., outside Albany. While his parents wanted him to attend college, their savings suffered in the 2001 recession.         \n\nSo Mr. Tolmie got a job at a Johnny Rockets restaurant. By the time he started college in 2007, he had saved $8,000, four times as much as his parents had accumulated for him.         \n\nImpressed by the pluck he had demonstrated in passing so many Advanced Placement tests, N.Y.U. guaranteed Mr. Tolmie $25,000 in merit scholarships each year, which left him with about $75,000 that he needed to earn over three years. \u201cI had a chart on my desk so that every time I sat down I would need to look at it,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery two weeks I needed X amount. That first year, it would have been around $600 after taxes.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/business/college-costs-battled-a-paycheck-at-a-time.html", "date": "2013-02-09", "description": "The modern realities of soaring tuition and other expenses are testing, but not defeating, the tradition of working one\u2019s way through school."}
