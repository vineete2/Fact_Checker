{"headline": "What Does It Take to Stop Crips and Bloods From Killing Each Other?", "body": "\nI first met Cynthia Mendenhall two hours before the funeral of her nephew, Frank Evans Jr. We were seated in the booth of a Denny\u2019s on the edge of Watts, eight miles south of downtown Los Angeles. I expressed my condolences. She received them with a nod. Her sister-in-law, she said, was taking it hard. In fact, she nearly refused to come to the funeral. Even though it had been almost two weeks since Frank was shot, she still couldn\u2019t accept that he was dead.         \n\nMendenhall could. A 51-year-old mother of four, she had lost two sons to gang warfare in Watts, something she knew well. During the 1980s, Mendenhall was a high-ranking member of the PJ Crips, one of the oldest Crips gangs in Watts. We sat down at a booth, and Mendenhall began to talk.         \n\n\u201cFrank was a free spirit, an African-American white boy, a hippie,\u201d she said. \u201cHe thought he could go anywhere.\u201d Frank, who was nicknamed \u201cPeace,\u201d was wrong about that.         \n\nGangs in Los Angeles don\u2019t fly their colors the way they used to, but the rivalries persist. In the 1980s, members of the two dominant gangs, the Crips and the Bloods, flaunted their affiliation by dressing in blue (Crips) or red (Bloods), even though doing so made them targets. Today, computer databases, gang injunctions and enhanced criminal sanctions for gang-related crime have driven such obvious, outward expressions of gang affiliation underground. Gang members now wear their colors mainly on YouTube (where they conceal their identities with bandannas) or on special occasions. As a result, a blue or red shirt no longer signifies gang membership in the way that it used to. At least, it\u2019s not supposed to. But when Evans stepped out of a friend\u2019s house wearing blue in a part of South Los Angeles controlled by the Swan Bloods, a member of the gang pedaling past took offense and opened fire on him.         \n\n\u201cNow they just found out they shot the wrong person,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cThey say, \u2018Oh, my God, we did not know who he was.\u2019 \u201d Meaning: they didn\u2019t know about me. Mendenhall is better known in South Los Angeles as Sista Soulja, a name earned in the 1980s when Watts was practically a war zone. (Mendenhall is not to be confused with Sister Souljah, the rapper Bill Clinton made famous on the 1992 campaign trail.)         \n\nThe code of the streets is clear: You kill one of mine, I\u2019ll kill one of yours. But things have changed in South L.A., somewhat. When Mendenhall\u2019s cellphone rings a half-hour into breakfast, it\u2019s not a PJ Crip calling to plan a counterattack; rather, it\u2019s her favorite police officer, Sgt. Anthony Cato, who grew up near Watts. He\u2019s calling to talk about arrangements for the funeral and the three repasts that will follow it, each of which is occurring in a different part of the city so that mourners from rival gangs won\u2019t have to cross into each other\u2019s territories.         \n\n\u201cO.K., O.K., listen to me,\u201d Mendenhall tells him. She then reviews where she wants Cato to deploy his officers \u2014 these intersections, this many cars, this close to the church where the service is taking place. She even specifies their gear (\u201csoft tactical,\u201d meaning short-sleeve shirts and a more casual look). The goal is to provide enough of a law-enforcement presence to prevent a drive-by shooting \u2014 funerals make for tempting targets \u2014 without angering family members by overwhelming the occasion with police officers. Satisfied, Mendenhall tells Cato she\u2019ll see him that afternoon at the repast at Imperial Courts, a 498-unit public-housing project that has long been the PJ Crips\u2019 home base. The Los Angeles Police Department, which for most of Mendenhall\u2019s life has been the enemy, was now working with her \u2014 almost for her \u2014 to ensure the day was a nonviolent one.         \n\n \n, violent crime in the United States has fallen by more than 40 percent. By all accounts, police departments today are more professional, less corrupt and more effective than they were 30 years ago. Yet, for a variety of reasons, minority perceptions of the police have not improved. A 2009 Pew Research Center study found that just 14 percent of African-Americans had a great deal of confidence in the proposition that their local police officers treated blacks and whites equally, compared with 38 percent of whites who thought so.
