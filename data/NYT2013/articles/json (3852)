{"headline": "Senators Offer a Bipartisan Blueprint for Immigration", "body": "\nA bipartisan group of senators has agreed on a set of principles for a sweeping overhaul of the  \n system, including a pathway to American citizenship for 11 million illegal immigrants that would hinge on progress in securing the borders and ensuring that foreigners leave the country when their visas expire.         \n\nThe senators were able to reach a deal by incorporating the Democrats\u2019 insistence on a single comprehensive bill that would not deny eventual citizenship to illegal immigrants, with Republican demands that strong border and interior enforcement had to be clearly in place before Congress could consider legal status for illegal immigrants.         \n\nTheir blueprint, unveiled on Monday, will allow them to stake out their position one day before President Obama outlines his immigration proposals in a speech on Tuesday in Las Vegas, in the opening moves of what lawmakers expect will be a protracted and contentious debate in Congress this year.         \n\nLawmakers said they were optimistic that the political mood had changed since a similar effort collapsed in acrimony  \n. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and one of the negotiators, said he saw \u201ca new appreciation\u201d among Republicans of the need for an overhaul.         \n\n\u201cLook at the last election,\u201d Mr. McCain said Sunday morning on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week With George Stephanopoulos.\u201d \u201cWe are losing dramatically the Hispanic vote, which we think should be ours.\u201d The senator also said he had seen \u201csignificant improvements\u201d in border enforcement, although \u201cwe\u2019ve still got a ways to go.\u201d         \n\nHe added, \u201cWe can\u2019t go on forever with 11 million people living in this country in the shadows in an illegal status.\u201d         \n\nAccording to a five-page draft of the plan obtained by The New York Times on Sunday, the eight senators \u2014 including Mr. McCain; Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York; and Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina \u2014 have agreed to address the failings of the immigration system in one comprehensive measure, rather than in smaller pieces, and to offer a \u201ctough, fair and practical road map\u201d that would eventually lead to a chance at citizenship for nearly all of the immigrants here illegally.         \n\n\u201cWe on the Democratic side have said that we are flexible and we want to get a bill,\u201d Mr. Schumer told reporters in New York on Sunday. \u201cBut there\u2019s a bottom line, and that\u2019s a path to citizenship for the 11 or so million people who qualify. We\u2019ve made great, great progress with our Republican colleagues.\u201d         \n\nUnder the senators\u2019 plan, most illegal immigrants would be able to apply to become permanent residents \u2014 a crucial first step toward citizenship \u2014 but only after certain border enforcement measures had been accomplished.         \n\nAmong the plan\u2019s new proposals is the creation of a commission of governors, law enforcement officials and community leaders from border states that would assess when border security measures had been completed. A proposal would also require that an exit system be in place for tracking departures of foreigners who entered the country through airports or seaports, before any illegal immigrants could start on a path to citizenship.         \n\nThe lawmakers intend for their proposals to frame the debate in the Senate, which is expected to take up immigration this spring, ahead of the House of Representatives. Compared with an immigration blueprint from 2011 that White House officials have said is the basis for the president\u2019s position, the senators\u2019 proposals appear to include tougher enforcement and a less direct path for illegal immigrants than Mr. Obama is considering.         \n\nIn a parallel effort, a separate group of four senators will introduce a bill this week dealing with another thorny issue that is likely to be addressed in a comprehensive measure: visas for legal immigrants with advanced skills in technology and science. The bill, written primarily by Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, a Republican, and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, a Democrat, would nearly double the number of temporary visas, known as an H-1B, available each year to highly skilled immigrants. It would also free up more permanent resident visas, known as green cards, so those immigrants could eventually settle in the United States and go on to become citizens.
