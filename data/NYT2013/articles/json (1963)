{"headline": "The Perils of Ascribing Meaning to a Random Event", "body": "\n \n         \n\nI almost hit a deer this summer. It happened one morning while I was driving my motorcycle down to Salt Lake City from my home in Park City, Utah. It was early and still dark, so the deer appeared to come from out of nowhere. Luckily, for both me and the deer, my reflexes didn\u2019t fail me, and we both went on our way.         \n\nThat moment in time has become a touch point in my brain. Now, every time I drive by that particular spot on that particular road when it\u2019s dark, I expect a deer to run across the road. It\u2019s like a red warning light is going off in my brain.         \n\nBut there\u2019s a big hole in my logic. Deer cross the road at many other spots between Salt Lake City and Park City. Even though I think my experience with one deer is telling me something specific, it\u2019s actually not.         \n\nGiven all the possible factors \u2014 time, location, actual deer in the area \u2014 it\u2019s highly improbable that I\u2019ll see another deer at that exact same spot in the road. But the way we\u2019re wired can lead us to make certain assumptions that aren\u2019t based on fact.         \n\nDaniel Kahneman describes it this way in his book \u201cThinking, Fast and Slow\u201d: \u201cWe are prone to exaggerate the consistency and coherence of what we see.\u201d A few lines later he explains why: \u201cWe are pattern seekers, believers in a coherent world, in which regularities \u2026 appear not by accident but as a result of mechanical causality or of someone\u2019s intention.\u201d         \n\nLife is more random than we care to admit. I suspect it\u2019s because randomness implies uncertainty and a lack of control. But when we try to assign meaning to one or two events, it can blind us to what\u2019s really happening.         \n\nFor instance, think back to 2008-9. At the time, it was incredibly painful for some people to own a home. If they weren\u2019t upside down on their mortgage, the chances were good that the home value itself was significantly lower than in previous years.         \n\nNow, if you were one of those homeowners, it would be really easy to say, \u201cI never want to own a home again.\u201d But if that decision is based solely on that one, albeit painful, experience, it may be a decision based on a cognitive bias.         \n\nYes, owning a home isn\u2019t the best option for everyone. Making big financial decisions like buying a home, however, requires more than one data point, like the pain of owning in 2008-9 or a statistic that says everyone should now rent.         \n\nMaking big financial decisions based on one or two events that may or may not be related is a horrible strategy. I say this as a person who now thinks twice about owning a home and looks for deer at the same spot in the road. But how can we determine if we\u2019re acting based on bias or fact?         \n\nFirst, it helps to acknowledge that what we think we know may be biased. Recognizing that a bias exists can help us take the next step: questioning what we think we know. Does our desire to act come from one moment in time or a moment combined with other objective data? Second, we need to treat certain numbers, like statistics, with caution.         \n\nStatistics can be like that deer I saw on the road. We see a number and project out all sorts of consequences from it. The reality is that even statisticians don\u2019t always know what the numbers mean. I do understand why it\u2019s so tempting to make decisions based solely on numbers, however,  \n.         \n\nNumbers appear to be hard facts. Yet it seems to me that it\u2019s very easy for us to take them out of context. As a result, we don\u2019t always understand how a particular number relates to our individual situations (if it does at all).         \n\nFinally, we need to give ourselves a break. There\u2019s a ton of pressure for us to act when these single events happen. If we don\u2019t act, then there\u2019s the fear we\u2019ve made a mistake, that we didn\u2019t see the signs, so we deserve it if bad things happen to us as a result.         \n\nThat\u2019s insane.         \n\nLife is random, and at times, we\u2019ll have to act with limited information. That said, we shouldn\u2019t cheat ourselves out of the opportunity to take advantage of all the information we do have. And it\u2019s rare that one moment in time will give us enough information to make the big decisions.
