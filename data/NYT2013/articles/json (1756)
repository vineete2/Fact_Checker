{"headline": "M.L.S. Tries to Mute Fans\u2019 Vulgar Chants", "body": "\nFor decades, soccer officials in the United States simply wanted some fans in their stadiums. Now they have them, and some of those fans have brought an unexpected problem: a vulgar chant, in the vein of more notoriously rabid soccer fans in other countries.         \n\nHardly clever, it is only three words \u2014 an insult directed at the opposing goalkeeper \u2014 but enough to give M.L.S. officials fits as they hear it spill over into live television broadcasts. The chant\u2019s simplicity is what makes it appealing or appalling, depending on your perspective.         \n\nIt has been heard this season at  \n games in Seattle; Sandy, Utah; Harrison, N.J.; Kansas City, Kan.; and Columbus, Ohio, among other places. It has been shouted by thousands of fans at men\u2019s national team games, too.         \n\n\u201cSport is spontaneous, it\u2019s passionate, and I don\u2019t think any of us would want to remove that from the game,\u201d said Evan Dabby, senior director of supporter relations at M.L.S. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes it beautiful. That\u2019s what makes it enticing.\u201d         \n\nBut there are boundaries around that beauty, the league has decided. Dabby this season has overseen a new, focused initiative to get clubs to eradicate the chant, which, according to him, \u201cis neither passionate nor spontaneous.\u201d         \n\nThe sentiment behind the effort is not new. Commissioner Don Garber spoke out publicly against the chant last year. Before that, teams like the Portland Timbers and the New England Revolution, among others, engaged in something like fan diplomacy, behavioral psychology or motivational tactics \u2014 or perhaps all three. Their efforts have revealed how a fledgling sports league tries to nurture and shape an emergent fan base.         \n\nIt appears to be succeeding, partially. The league said the chant was no longer done in organized fashion at any M.L.S. stadiums, though it remains a delicate situation.         \n\n\u201cWhat anyone can witness is progress,\u201d Dabby said.         \n\nIt is deployed in one specific game situation: when the opposing team\u2019s goalkeeper prepares to restart the game on a goal kick, there is a crescendo of percussive noise and swelling voices. When the player then puts his foot through the ball, the fans yell out the phrase in unison.         \n\n \n, known as the Y.S.A. chant, is a more vulgar expression of \u201cYou suck, jerk.\u201d It has deep but unclear roots, dating back at least a decade. Its form and usage are similar to ones used in South America, Central America and Europe, suggesting that early M.L.S. fans \u2014 who borrow heavily at first from international fan cultures \u2014 adopted the structure and added their own choice words.         \n\n\u201cIt was a way to be antagonistic, in a tongue-in-cheek way,\u201d said Dave Hoyt, a former president of Portland\u2019s fan group, Timbers Army. \u201cIt gets people\u2019s attention.\u201d         \n\nTimbers fans used the chant from about 2007 to 2009 (when the club played in a minor league), Hoyt said, before deciding as a group that it was overused. Hoyt said it was not about censorship. \u201cWe still have plenty of chants that have blue language, or whatever you want to call it,\u201d he said.         \n\nIts obscenity is the chief concern for its harshest critics. Others, like Hoyt, simply find it played out. And some, particularly those exposed to overseas soccer stadiums, may wonder what the fuss is about.         \n\nAnti-Semitic chants last season at a Premier League stadium in England caused a scandal. Racist chants directed at black players continue to be a scourge for many European leagues. Set against these examples, the American chanting may seem harmless.         \n\nBut Jerome de Bontin, a former president of the French club Monaco, who was hired last year as the general manager of the Red Bulls, said residual European hooligan culture was nothing to aspire to. He said he appreciated that American fans seemed interested in games rather than creating a ruckus and was disappointed when he heard the chant for the first time.\u00a0         \n\n\u201cI thought it was absurd, that it really didn\u2019t belong and that, if we didn\u2019t take some action, it would probably get worse because, as more fans come to the games, they would develop this false idea that it\u2019s accepted, that it\u2019s encouraged,\u201d de Bontin said.
