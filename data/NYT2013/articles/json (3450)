{"headline": "Health Care\nLaw Fails to\nLower Prices\nfor Rural Areas", "body": "\nAs technical failures bedevil the rollout of President Obama\u2019s health care law, evidence is emerging that one of the program\u2019s loftiest goals \u2014 to encourage competition among insurers in an effort to keep costs low \u2014 is falling short for many rural Americans.         \n\nWhile competition is intense in many populous regions, rural areas and small towns have far fewer carriers offering plans in the law\u2019s online exchanges. Those places, many of them poor, are being asked to choose from some of the highest-priced plans in the 34 states where the federal government is running the health insurance marketplaces, a review by The New York Times has found.         \n\nOf the roughly 2,500 counties served by the federal exchanges, more than half, or 58 percent, have plans offered by just one or two insurance carriers, according to an analysis by The Times of county-level data provided by the Department of Health and Human Services. In about 530 counties, only a single insurer is participating.         \n\nThe analysis suggests that the ambitions of the Affordable Care Act to increase competition have unfolded unevenly, at least in the early going, and have not addressed many of the factors that contribute to high prices. Insurance companies are reluctant to enter challenging new markets, experts say, because medical costs are high, dominant insurers are difficult to unseat, and powerful hospital systems resist efforts to lower rates.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the structure of the Affordable Care Act which really deals with that problem,\u201d said John Holahan, a fellow at the Urban Institute, who noted that many factors determine costs in a given market. \u201cI think that all else being equal, premiums will clearly be higher when there\u2019s not that competition.\u201d         \n\nThe Obama administration has said 95 percent of Americans live in areas where there are at least two insurers in the exchanges. But many experts say two might not be enough to create competition that would help lower prices.         \n\nFor example, in Wyoming, two insurers are offering plans at prices that are higher than in neighboring Montana, where a third carrier is seen as a factor in keeping prices lower.         \n\nIt is unclear how the online marketplaces might evolve over time. Many large insurers are closely watching what happens in the first year to decide whether to more aggressively pursue new markets. In the meantime, problems with the healthcare.gov Web site are making it harder for them to know whether the exchanges\u2019 slow start is the result of technical difficulties or more serious underlying problems, such as a lack of consumer demand, that would discourage them from entering.         \n\nIn some cases, competition varies markedly across county lines. In Monroe County, Fla., which includes the Florida Keys, two insurers, Cigna and Florida Blue, offer plans on the federal exchanges. In neighboring Miami-Dade County, there are seven companies, including Aetna and Humana, two of the nation\u2019s largest players.         \n\nIn rural Baker County, Ga., where there is only one insurer, a 50-year-old shopping for a silver plan would pay at least $644.05 before federal subsidies. (Plans range in price and levels of coverage from bronze to platinum, with silver a middle option.) A 50-year-old in Atlanta, where there are four carriers, could pay $320.06 for a comparable plan. Federal subsidies could significantly reduce monthly premiums for people with low incomes.         \n\nCounties with one carrier are mostly concentrated in the South. Nearly all of the counties in Mississippi and Alabama, for example, are served by just one insurer, according to The Times\u2019s analysis. Other states with scarce competition include Maine, West Virginia, North Carolina and Alaska.         \n\n\u201cThe consumer wants some level of choice,\u201d said Alexander K. Feldvebel, the deputy insurance commissioner for New Hampshire, where one carrier, Anthem Blue Cross, owned by WellPoint, now offers plans. \u201cYou don\u2019t have that when you have a single carrier offering all the products.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/24/business/health-law-fails-to-keep-prices-low-in-rural-areas.html", "date": "2013-10-23", "description": "More than half of the counties in the 34 states on the federally run health exchange are served by just one or two insurers, and the premiums are high in areas with the least competition."}
