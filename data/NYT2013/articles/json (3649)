{"headline": "When Cold Cases Stay Cold", "body": "\nFERRIDAY, La. \u2014 In the spring of 1965, the  \n in Washington received a letter from Concordia Parish in northeastern Louisiana. Addressed to the bureau\u2019s director, J. Edgar Hoover, the letter pleaded for justice in the killing of a well-respected black merchant.         \n\nA few months earlier, the businessman, Frank Morris, had come upon two white men early one morning at the front of his shoe-repair shop, one pointing a shotgun at him, the other holding a canister of gas. A match was ignited, a conflagration begun, and Morris died four days later of his burns without naming the men, perhaps fearing retribution against his family.         \n\nThe letter expressed grave concern that the crime would go unpunished because the local police were probably complicit. \u201cYour office is our only hope so don\u2019t fail us,\u201d it concluded. It was signed:         \n\n\u201cYours truly, The Colored People of Concordia Parish.\u201d         \n\nNearly five decades later, the Justice Department has written back \u2014 not directly to the family of Mr. Morris or to the black community of Concordia Parish, but to dozens of other families who lost loved ones during this country\u2019s tumultuous and violent civil rights era.         \n\nSeveral years ago, the F.B.I. began reopening cold cases from that era \u2014 112 at last count \u2014 raising hopes among some for justice. In all but about 20, though, the families of the long dead have received letters, often hand-delivered by F.B.I. agents, that say their cases have been closed, there is nothing more to be done \u2014 and please accept our condolences.         \n\nSimultaneously intimate and bureaucratic, these letters serve as epistolary echoes of an increasingly distant time. To some, they reflect the elusiveness of resolution in cases decades old; to others, they represent another missed opportunity for a full accounting of what happened, and why.         \n\nGrace Hall Miller, a retired school board member in Newton, Ga., received one of these letters two years ago. It recounted a day in March 1965 that she hardly could have forgotten, when a man named Cal Hall Jr. fatally shot her husband,  \n, a farmer and church deacon, in a dispute over cows. Mr. Hall, who was white, shot Mr. Miller, who was black, in the back.         \n\nThe letter recalled the notorious travel of the case, from repeated failures by grand juries to indict Mr. Hall to a \u201cdisproportionately white\u201d jury\u2019s finding against the Miller family in a wrongful-death lawsuit. It also summed up what the F.B.I. had done after reopening the case: interviews with Ms. Miller and a family friend, a check with the local sheriff\u2019s office, and a search of county death records.         \n\n\u201cAfter careful review of this incident, we have concluded that the now deceased Cal Hall Jr. acted alone when he shot and killed your husband, and therefore, we have no choice but to close our investigation,\u201d the letter said. \u201cWe regret that we cannot be of further assistance to you. Again, please accept our sincere condolences for the loss of your husband\u201d \u2014 a man who had died nearly a half-century earlier.         \n\nMs. Miller, now 80, said that she had placed judgment in God\u2019s hands long ago, and could not understand why the F.B.I. had reopened the case to give it only a cursory review. \u201cI guess they were just trying to make a show,\u201d she said.         \n\nOne of Ms. Miller\u2019s daughters is Shirley Sherrod, who was  \n with the federal Agriculture Department in 2010 after a conservative blogger edited a video of a public appearance to make her appear racist. The White House later apologized, and she was offered a new job.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very unsatisfying,\u201d said Ms. Sherrod, one of six children. \u201cEven after all these years, the system wouldn\u2019t do anything. We didn\u2019t get justice.\u201d         \n\nAdam S. Lee, the chief of the F.B.I. section overseeing civil rights, said that the bureau had been rigorous in pursuing these cold cases, following any evidence that might lead to prosecutions. But, he added, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t bring the emotional closure that the public wants, or needs, in cases like this.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nIn 2006, the F.B.I. began a cold-case initiative that it described as a comprehensive effort to investigate racially motivated murders from the civil rights era. That effort became a mandate two years later when Congress passed the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act, named after the 14-year-old black boy who was tortured and killed in Mississippi in 1955, for supposedly flirting with a white woman.
