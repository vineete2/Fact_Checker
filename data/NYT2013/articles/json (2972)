{"headline": "In Syrian Clash Over \u2018Death Highway,\u2019 a Bitterly Personal War", "body": "\nHEESH, Syria \u2014 The Islamic fighters peered through rifle scopes and machine-gun sights at the remains of a Syrian military convoy disabled on the highway several hundred yards away. They were peppering President  \n\u2019s soldiers with gunfire, trying to prevent their escape.         \n\n\u201cHere are the heroes and mujahedeen of the Shield of Mohammed, peace be upon him,\u201d one fighter said softly as others opened fire.         \n\nThe Syrian Army answered the rebels\u2019 gunfire. Tanks fired into the village from one direction, artillery from another. The ground shook. Smoke and dust rose. Defenseless against the exploding artillery rounds, the rebels kept firing, and were not driven off.         \n\nAs spring arrives in Syria, the civil war closes out its second year in a mosaic of vicious and widely scattered battles, like this one, where the Damascus-Aleppo highway crosses an open agricultural plain in the south of Idlib Province.         \n\nSince late last spring, antigovernment fighters have wrested much of northern Syria from Mr. Assad\u2019s control, overrunning military checkpoints and several bases, and pushing the army back. But the rebel tide, largely led in northwestern Syria by Islamic groups, moves slowly, checked by weapon shortages and by a lingering archipelago of government positions where the army and loyalist militias have settled in with powerful weapons, equipped for a long fight. Each of these military positions, and the roads between them, have become minifronts, an almost uncountable set of bloody battlefields where rebels try to silence government outposts, which are mostly arrayed around Syria\u2019s main cities.         \n\nIt is a bitterly personal war, in which Islamic and more secular fighters share an immediate goal: to protect their own families, an ambition they accuse the West of not adequately supporting.         \n\nFrom its remaining positions, Mr. Assad\u2019s army maintains a lethal reach over ground it can no longer walk, firing rockets, mortars and artillery into residential neighborhoods. Often the weakened Syrian Air Force joins in, dropping bombs. Ballistic missiles occasionally crash in from afar.         \n\nThese attacks, doled out by the Alawite-led government against a predominantly Sunni Muslim population, and sustained now for many months, are killing civilians, idling the economy and driving families away from their homes. They are also fuel for sectarian anger.         \n\nThe rebels have had high-profile successes. In January they captured both the  \n and Idlib\u2019s main prison. But for months their gains have mostly been incremental.         \n\nThe battle at Heesh \u2014 for one of the few roads in the Idlib region that Mr. Assad\u2019s forces still risk using \u2014 is, as one fighter described it, a contest for a \u201cdeath highway\u201d in which one side has a full conventional arsenal and the other is armed with faith as much as weapons. It captures part of the war in a microcosm.         \n\nFrom a knoll rising above farmers\u2019 fields, Heesh overlooks the stretch of four-lane highway between Hama and Aleppo, two cities where the army is thickly garrisoned.         \n\nSeveral Syrian Army checkpoints are strung along the asphalt, a bid to keep ground supply lines open \u2014 a military imperative for Mr. Assad in part because his government\u2019s helicopter fleet has been thinned, making aerial resupply difficult.         \n\nFighting had already ravaged part of the village by last fall, when the government hit it with airstrikes several times. But in late January, hundreds of rebels from an Islamic brigade known as Soqour al-Sham, or the Falcons of Syria, gathered in Heesh and formed a blocking position on the western side of the road.         \n\nAnother armed group, the Grandsons of the Prophet, took up positions on the opposite side, creating a gauntlet for the army.         \n\nThe battle has flashed intermittently ever since.         \n\nCreeping forward by night and massing by day, rebels now watch from small bunkers, buildings and fighting holes that extend from the town toward the highway\u2019s edge. The army, unwilling to give up a vital leg of road, uses artillery and airstrikes to try to force them back; it has recently struck the town with  \n.         \n\nIn all, 50 rebels have been wounded and 20 killed in the contest for this tiny place in the past six weeks, according to Fadi Yasin, a spokesman for one of Soqour al-Sham\u2019s battalions.         \n\nBlast by blast, what is left of Heesh is being cracked into rubble. Its people have moved away.         \n\nThe fighters remain, hoping that by cutting off supplies to the army checkpoints north of Heesh they will cause the soldiers there to run low on ammunition, and ultimately to abandon them.         \n\nEach silenced outpost, they know, is one less outpost that can fire on Idlib\u2019s towns.
