{"headline": "When Artworks Crash: Restorers Face Digital Test", "body": "\nPaintings fade; sculptures chip. Art restorers have long known how to repair those material flaws, so the experience of looking at a Vermeer or a Rodin remains basically unchanged over time. But when creativity is computerized, the art isn\u2019t so easy to fix.         \n\nFor instance, when a Web-based work becomes technologically obsolete, does updated software simply restore it? Or is the piece fundamentally changed?         \n\nThat was the conundrum facing the  \n, which in 1995 became one of the first institutions to acquire an Internet-made artwork. Created by the artist Douglas Davis,  \n functioned as blog comments do today, allowing users to add to the opening lines. An early example of interactive computer art, the piece attracted 200,000 contributions from 1994 to 2000 from all over the globe.         \n\nBy 2005 the piece had been shifted between computer servers, and the programmer moved on. When Whitney curators decided to resurrect the piece last year, the art didn\u2019t work. Once innovative, \u201cThe World\u2019s First Collaborative Sentence\u201d now mostly just crashed browsers. The rudimentary code and links were out of date. There was endlessly scrolling and seemingly indecipherable text in a format that had long ago ceased being cutting edge.         \n\n\u201cThis is not how one uses the Internet now,\u201d Sarah Hromack, the Whitney\u2019s director of digital media, said. \u201cBut in the \u201990s, it was.\u201d         \n\nFor a generation, institutions from the Museum of Modern Art in New York to the Pompidou Center in Paris have been collecting digital art. But in trying to restore the Davis work, which was finally debugged and reposted at the end of May, the Whitney encountered what many exhibitors, collectors and artists are also discovering: the 1s and 0s of digital art degrade far more rapidly than traditional visual art does, and the demands of upkeep are much higher. Nor is the way forward clear.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working on constantly shifting grounds,\u201d said Rudolf Frieling, a curator of media arts at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, which has been at the forefront of sustaining online art. \u201cWhatever hardware, platform or device we\u2019re using is not going to be there tomorrow.\u201d         \n\n\u201cFrankly speaking,\u201d he added, \u201cit\u2019s a huge challenge. Not every museum is set up to do that. It takes huge technical expertise.\u201d         \n\nThe riddles are only solved by \u201cactually doing it,\u201d Mr. Frieling explained.         \n\nAt the Whitney, a team of programmers and curators spent more than a year debating and tinkering with the restoration of \u201cCollaborative Sentence.\u201d Mr. Davis,  \n in technologically enhanced art who is now 80, was unable to take part in consultations on rebuilding his piece, and without a creator\u2019s blueprint in place, almost every meeting turned into a conceptual debate.         \n\n\u201cOne of the biggest philosophical questions,\u201d said Christiane Paul, adjunct curator of new media at the museum, \u201cwas, do we leave these links broken, as a testament to the Web\u201d and its rapid development?         \n\nLike much early digital art, \u201cCollaborative Sentence\u201d is still valuable, Ms. Paul said, especially as a harbinger of the future. By allowing interaction across cultures and countries, \u201cit anticipated so much of what happened in Web 2.0,\u201d she said.         \n\nBut many artists, curators and patrons are now reconsidering whether such art should remain unchanged, said  \n, the head of collection care research at the Tate Gallery in London. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer the model that a museum acquires something into its collection and tries to fix it into the time it was acquired or when it left the artist\u2019s studio.\u201d         \n\nThe Whitney considered several options. One was to simply let technological extinction take its course, and view Web-based art as \u201cephemeral, like a performance,\u201d Ms. Paul said.         \n\nAnother tactic was to let the new generation of Web-based creators and everyday Internet users help with the maintenance. Or the Whitney could attract more viewers by modernizing the design of the piece. But, Ms. Paul said, \u201cthat seemed too radical an intervention.\u201d         \n\nAfter much deliberation, the curators decided on a nearly unheard-of artistic solution: to duplicate Mr. Davis\u2019s installation and present it in both original and updated forms.         \n\nOne version is the frozen original, with broken code, pages of oddly formatted, garbled text and instructions for users who wanted to fax in their contributions (including the number for the Lehman College gallery, which first showed the piece). Links were redirected, through the archiving site the  \n, to their 1990s counterparts.         \n\n\u201cThe idea is that it\u2019s sort of a time capsule,\u201d said Ben Fino-Radin, a digital archivist who helped rebuild the work.         \n\nThe new version, which the Whitney calls the live version, looks similar but has some new links. Users can\u2019t contribute to the historical site, but they can add to the live one \u2014 albeit not by fax. The Whitney also open-sourced part of the original, hoping that users would contribute to its upkeep.         \n\nIn 1995 Mr. Davis\u2019s piece was shown in a biennial in South Korea attended by the celebrated video artist Nam June Paik. It has hundreds of comments in Korean, but the code for the characters was so degraded that Mr. Fino-Radin was stumped. If other viewers fix it, he said, seeing those messages \u201cwill be a first for Western audiences.\u201d         \n\nWith new digital art being created ever more rapidly, the debate over sustaining it will continue, just as surely as the technology leapfrogs ahead of it. Over the last decade, experts at the New Art Trust, the Tate Modern in London and the Museums of Modern Art in New York and San Francisco started  \n, a consortium dedicated to studying these issues. Another group, the  \n, was started by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and the  \n.         \n\nAided by organizations like  \n, where Mr. Fino-Radin is based and which works with emerging artists and art forms, they have helped spread the word about the urgent need for conservation.         \n\n\u201cFor institutions that early on committed to Net art, a lot of that work is now vanishing,\u201d Ms. Paul said.         \n\nAnd the proliferation of online culture, social media and smart gadgets \u2014 and whatever the next tech revolution brings \u2014 will make preserving those visionary moments \u201cmore challenging,\u201d she said. \u201cNot less.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/10/arts/design/whitney-saves-douglas-daviss-first-collaborative-sentence.html", "date": "2013-06-09", "description": "When the Whitney Museum of American Art decided to resurrect an early interactive Internet piece, the programming code no longer worked.
