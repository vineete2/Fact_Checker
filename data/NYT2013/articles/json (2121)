{"headline": "Focus Turns to Investigation in Fatal Bronx Train Crash", "body": "\nThe 5:54 from Poughkeepsie was rumbling through the Bronx on Sunday morning. Only 100 to 150 people were onboard \u2014 department store employees who were bracing for another busy after-Thanksgiving day, tourists from Texas who wanted to climb the Statue of Liberty, a police officer moonlighting as a security guard on his day off.         \n\nSome were dozing when the train rounded a bend near where tracks pass under the Henry Hudson Bridge. Some were listening to music on headphones. Suddenly, with a jerk that disrupted the steady train\u2019s steady rhythm, their world turned upside down as they were hurled from one side to the other.         \n\nIn the chaos of screeching metal and the shower of debris as the train kept plowing along, some passengers grabbed for the luggage racks and held on. Others hugged their seats as the eight cars of the train flew off the tracks and several landed on their sides.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking I\u2019m going into the water,\u201d said Eddie Russell, 48, who had been listening with his eyes closed to LL Cool J. \u201cI was thinking of me, surviving.\u201d         \n\nPolice and transit officials said four people on board were killed and more than 60 were injured, 11 critically. Three of the four dead were thrown from the train after the windows blew out, the officials said.         \n\nIt was not clear how fast the Metro-North train was going. But an official from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said the train operator had reported that the train was going into the turn too fast and that he had performed an emergency braking maneuver.         \n\nThe operator told the first rescuers to reach the scene that he had \u201cdumped\u201d the brakes, according to the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.         \n\nDumping the brakes, railroad experts said, is a last-resort move that has the effect of slamming on the emergency brakes on all the cars of a train at once. It is usually done to avert a collision with another train or a vehicle at a grade-level crossing.         \n\nOfficials opened an investigation but cautioned that it would take time to piece together the evidence and identify a possible cause. The National Transportation Safety Board sent investigators to the site with instructions to inspect the overturned cars and interpret information from the train\u2019s \u201cevent recorders,\u201d devices that are somewhat similar to the flight recorders on airplanes. The Federal Railroad Administration also dispatched a team of investigators.         \n\nEarl F. Weener of the transportation safety board said at a morning news conference with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo that investigators had yet to interview the operator of the train, who was among those injured. A spokeswoman for Metro-North said the engineer, identified as William Rockefeller of Germantown, N.Y., had about 14 years\u2019 experience with the line. There were also three conductors on the train.         \n\n\u201cOur mission is to not just understand what happened but why it happened, with the intent of preventing it from happening again,\u201d Mr. Weener said.         \n\nThe accident was the latest episode in a trying year for Metro-North, the nation\u2019s second-largest commuter railroad, and the first with passenger fatalities in Metro-North\u2019s 30-year history.         \n\nIn May, two Metro-North trains slammed into each other near Fairfield, Conn., during the evening rush. Scores of passengers were hurt, five critically.         \n\nAnd in July, a CSX freight train derailed near where the Metro-North train left the tracks on Sunday. Officials said there was no connection between the accidents.         \n\nBy Sunday night, the transportation safety board had given Metro-North clearance to begin removing the crippled train and repairing the tracks. But the crash was likely to disrupt the Monday commute for thousands of passengers on the railroad\u2019s Hudson line. Metro-North arranged for buses to take Hudson line passengers to White Plains, N.Y., on Sunday to catch trains on a different line that was running normally. On Monday, Hudson line trains will be running as far south as Yonkers, where passengers will be able to catch buses to the 242nd Street station of the No. 1 train.
