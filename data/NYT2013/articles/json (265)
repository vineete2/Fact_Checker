{"headline": "U.S. Open Cup: Orlando and Carolina Erase M.L.S. Teams", "body": "\nThey are the two first-place teams in the two leagues below Major League Soccer. And for at least a day, the minor league teams are the two biggest stories in American soccer.         \n\nThe Carolina RailHawks of the North American Soccer League and the Orlando City Lions of the United Soccer Leagues Pro division each upset teams from Major League Soccer on Wednesday night to advance to the quarterfinals of the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup.         \n\nWhile Carolina\u2019s 3-1 victory against Chivas USA in Cary, N.C., certainly qualifies as an upset, the M.L.S. club is in last place in the Western Conference and recently replaced its coach. Orlando\u2019s 1-0 victory in Kansas City, Kan., against Sporting Kansas City, however, probably qualifies as one of the biggest upsets in this year\u2019s edition of the 100-year history of the national club championship.         \n\nSporting and Orlando City, which plays in what is the third tier of the United States soccer pyramid, are affiliated clubs under a new  \n. As part of that agreement, S.K.C. (the defending Open Cup champion) sent four players on loan to Orlando City. But ahead of the match, the clubs agreed that the four players \u2014 Dom Dwyer, the leading scorer in U.S.L. Pro, Christian Duke, Yann Songo\u2019o and Jon Kempin \u2014 would be kept out of the game.         \n\nOrlando scored two minutes into the game when Long Tan, a striker from China who has played in M.L.S. for Vancouver and D.C. United, converted a pass from the Senegalese midfielder Adama Mbengue for the game\u2019s only goal.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really big result and something the players can be proud of,\u201d Orlando City Coach Adrian Heath,  \n. \u201cAll of a sudden we are a couple games from something really special. I\u2019m looking forward to playing the next-round opponent.\u201d         \n\nIn the quarterfinals, Orlando City will faceChicago. The Fire-Crew game was postponed Wednesday night because of inclement weather and rescheduled for Thursday afternoon in Bridgeview, Ill. Chicago advanced, 2-1, on a late goal by Patrick Nyarko.         \n\nIn other games Wednesday night, Dwayne De Rosario scored a hat trick in D.C. United\u2019s 3-1 win over Philadelphia; New England defeated the Red Bulls, 4-2; and Dallas ousted Houston, 3-0, in the three all-M.L.S. games; and Real Salt Lake beat the Charleston Battery (U.S.L. Pro), 5-2; and Portland shut out Tampa Bay (N.A.S.L.), 2-0.         \n\nThe match between Carolina and Chivas USA went to overtime before the RailHawks scored twice for the victory. Tiyiselani Shipalane gave the RailHawks a 1-0 lead in the 13th minute, but Walter Vilchez tied the score in the 57th minute. C\u00e9sar Elizondo scored on a cross from Shipalane in the 92nd minute and Brian Ackley added an insurance goal in the 98th.         \n\nIt was Carolina\u2019s second Open Cup win against a visiting M.L.S. team from Los Angeles. The RailHawks defeated the Galaxy in the tournament\u2019s third round and will play at Real Salt Lake in the quarterfinals on June 26.         \n\n \nKelyn Rowe scored two goals in the first half, while Fabian Espindola pulled one back for the Red Bulls in a match played in Cambridge, Mass. Dimitry Imbongo gave the Revolution a 3-1 lead when he tucked in a header in the 51st minute, but the Red Bulls stayed close when Jonny Steele scored in the 61st minute. Chris Tierney iced the game on a goal in the 87th minute.         \n\n\u201cThis is one of those things that you sweep it under the rug,\u201d Red Bulls Coach Mike Petke said after the game. \u201cThe fact is we lost to a mediocre team because we were way less than mediocre. It happens.\u201d         \n\nThe Red Bulls played the match without Tim Cahill (Australia) and Roy Miller (Costa Rica), who are on international duty. In addition, Thierry Henry and Jamison Olave did not dress for the game.         \n\n\u201cWe started the best lineup we could,\u201d Petke said. \u201cLike I said, we lost to a mediocre team because we were less than mediocre.\u201d         \n\nPetke\u2019s comments were provided by the Red Bulls in an audio file. An article that included his quotations, which could be interpreted by some as denigrating to the Revolution, was published on the league\u2019s Web site, MLSsoccer.com, and  \n after about 60 minutes Thursday morning. New England will play at D.C. in the quarterfinals.         \n\n \nKenny Cooper put Dallas ahead in the 37th minute, his sixth goal in the Open Cup. Cooper scored again in the 59th minute. Dallas will host Portland in the next round.         \n\n \nDane Kelly and Niki Paterson scored two minutes apart in the first half to give the Battery the lead less than 20 minutes into the game. But goals by Devon Sandoval and Joao Plata, on a penalty kick in the 79th minute, sent the game to extra time. R.S.L. scored three goals \u2014 by Sandoval, Khari Stephenson and Javier Morales \u2014 in the first overtime to ice the match.         \n\n \nMichael Nanchoff scored in the ninth minute, the fifth fastest goal in Timbers Open Cup history. The Portland captain Jack Jewsbury added a second goal in the 55th minute.         \n\n \n Dwayne De Rosario\u2019s three goals sent struggling United, which is in last place in the Eastern Conference of M.L.S., to the quarterfinals. D.C. has won the Open Cup two times, including a league and Cup double in the inaugural season of M.L.S.
