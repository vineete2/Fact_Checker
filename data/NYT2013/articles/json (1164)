{"headline": "As New Services Track Habits, the E-Books Are Reading You", "body": "\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Before the Internet, books were written \u2014 and published \u2014 blindly, hopefully. Sometimes they sold, usually they did not, but no one had a clue what readers did when they opened them up. Did they skip or skim? Slow down or speed up when the end was in sight? Linger over the sex scenes?         \n\nA wave of start-ups is using technology to answer these questions \u2014 and help writers give readers more of what they want. The companies get reading data from subscribers who, for a flat monthly fee, buy access to an array of titles, which they can read on a variety of devices. The idea is to do for books what Netflix did for movies and Spotify for music.         \n\n\u201cSelf-published writers are going to eat this up,\u201d said Mark Coker, the chief executive of  \n, a large independent publisher. \u201cMany seem to value their books more than their kids. They want anything that might help them reach more readers.\u201d         \n\nLast week, Smashwords  \n to put 225,000 books on Scribd, a digital library here that unveiled a reading subscription service in October. Many of Smashwords\u2019 books are already on  \n, a New York-based subscription start-up that also began in the fall.         \n\nThe move to exploit reading data is one aspect of how consumer analytics is making its way into every corner of the culture. Amazon and Barnes & Noble already collect vast amounts of information from their e-readers but keep it proprietary. Now the start-ups \u2014 which also include  \n, a North Carolina-based company \u2014 are hoping to profit by telling all.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be pretty open about sharing this data so people can use it to publish better books,\u201d said Trip Adler, Scribd\u2019s chief executive.         \n\nQuinn Loftis, a writer of young adult paranormal romances who lives in western Arkansas, interacts extensively with her fans on Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, Goodreads, YouTube, Flickr and her own website. These efforts at community, most of which did not exist a decade ago, have already given the 33-year-old a six-figure annual income. But having actual data about how her books are being read would take her market research to the ultimate level.         \n\n\u201cWhat writer would pass up the opportunity to peer into the reader\u2019s mind?\u201d she asked.         \n\nScribd is just beginning to analyze the data from its subscribers. Some general insights: The longer a mystery novel is, the more likely readers are to jump to the end to see who done it. People are more likely to finish biographies than business titles, but a chapter of a yoga book is all they need. They speed through romances faster than religious titles, and erotica fastest of all.         \n\nAt Oyster, a top book is \u201cWhat Women Want,\u201d promoted as a work that \u201cbrings you inside a woman\u2019s head so you can learn how to blow her mind.\u201d Everyone who starts it finishes it. On the other hand, Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.\u2019s \u201cThe Cycles of American History\u201d blows no minds: fewer than 1 percent of the readers who start it get to the end.         \n\nOyster data shows that readers are 25 percent more likely to finish books that are broken up into shorter chapters. That is an inevitable consequence of people reading in short sessions during the day on an iPhone.         \n\nA few writers might be repelled by too much knowledge. But others would be fascinated, as long as they retained control.         \n\n\u201cWould we provide this data to an author? Absolutely,\u201d said Chantal Restivo-Alessi, chief digital officer for HarperCollins Publishers. \u201cBut it is up to him how to write the book. The creative process is a mysterious process.\u201d         \n\nThe services say they will make the data anonymous so readers will not be identified. The privacy policies however are broad. \u201cYou are consenting to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information,\u201d Oyster tells new customers.         \n\nBefore writers will broadly be able to use any data, the services must become viable by making deals with publishers to supply the books. Publishers, however, are suspicious of yet another disruption to their business. HarperCollins has signed up with Oyster and Scribd, but Penguin Random House and Simon & Schuster have thus far stayed away.         \n\nSome agents, too, are wary.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell authors that it\u2019s worth starting a new relationship with any of these new services,\u201d said Ted Weinstein, an agent in San Francisco. \u201cIt is literally an unsustainable business model.\u201d         \n\nHere is how  \n and Oyster work: Readers pay about $10 a month for a library of about 100,000 books from traditional presses. They can read as many books as they want.         \n\n\u201cWe love big readers,\u201d said Eric\u00a0Stromberg,\u00a0Oyster\u2019s chief executive. But Oyster, whose management includes two ex-Google engineers, cannot afford too many of them.
