{"headline": "Confusion and Staff Troubles Rife at I.R.S. Office in Ohio", "body": "\nDuring the summer of 2010, the dozen or so accountants and tax agents of Group 7822 of the  \n office in Cincinnati got a directive from their manager. A growing number of organizations identifying themselves as part of the  \n had begun applying for tax exemptions, the manager said, advising the workers to be on the lookout for them and other groups planning to get involved in elections.         \n\nThe specialists, hunched over laptops on the office\u2019s fourth floor, rarely discussed politics, one former supervisor said. Low-level employees in what many in the I.R.S. consider a backwater, they processed thousands of applications a year, mostly from charities like private schools or hospitals.         \n\nFor months, the Tea Party cases sat on the desk of a lone specialist, who used \u201cpolitical sounding\u201d criteria \u2014 words like \u201cpatriots,\u201d \u201cwe the people\u201d \u2014 as a way to search efficiently through the flood of applications for groups that might not qualify for exemptions, according to the I.R.S. inspector general. \u201cTriage,\u201d the agency\u2019s acting chief described it.         \n\nAs a grim-faced President Obama denounced the \u201cinexcusable\u201d actions of the I.R.S. last week and lawmakers of both parties lined up in Washington on Friday to accuse it of an array of misconduct, everything seemed so clear: the nation\u2019s tax agency had deliberately targeted conservative activists, violating the public trust \u2014 and perhaps the law.         \n\nWhile there are still many gaps in the story of how the I.R.S. scandal happened, interviews with current and former employees and with lawyers who dealt with them, along with a review of I.R.S. documents, paint a more muddled picture of an understaffed Cincinnati outpost that was alienated from the broader I.R.S. culture and given little direction.         \n\nOverseen by a revolving cast of midlevel managers, stalled by miscommunication with I.R.S. lawyers and executives in Washington and confused about the rules they were enforcing, the Cincinnati specialists flagged virtually every application with Tea Party in its name. But their review went beyond conservative groups: more than 400 organizations came under scrutiny, including at least two dozen liberal-leaning ones and some that were seemingly apolitical.         \n\nOver three years, as the office struggled with a growing caseload of advocacy groups seeking tax exemptions, responsibility for the cases moved from one group of specialists to another, and the Determinations Unit, which handles all nonprofit applications, was reorganized. One batch of cases sat ignored for months. Few if any of the employees were experts on tax law, contributing to waves of questionnaires about groups\u2019 political activity and donors that top officials acknowledge were improper.         \n\n\u201cThe I.R.S. is pretty dysfunctional to begin with, and this case brought all those dysfunctions to their worst,\u201d said Paul Streckfus, a former I.R.S. employee who runs a  \n devoted to tax-exempt organizations. \u201cPeople were coming and going, asking for advice and not getting it, and sometimes forgetting the cases existed.\u201d         \n\nWho gets the blame and how far it goes are questions already consuming Washington. Two top I.R.S. officials have resigned,  \n, Steven Miller. The Justice Department has begun an investigation into potential civil rights and criminal violations by the I.R.S. This week, a House committee will seek to depose five I.R.S. employees, including a midlevel executive in Washington and a Cincinnati specialist said to have handled the cases in the spring and summer of 2010.         \n\n\u201cI think that what happened here was that foolish mistakes were made by people trying to be more efficient in their workload selection,\u201d Mr. Miller testified before a House committee Friday. While \u201cintolerable,\u201d he said, it \u201cwas not an act of partisanship.\u201d         \n\nAs a storm of criticism washes over what is \u2014 even in the best of times \u2014 the federal government\u2019s most reviled agency, some of those in Cincinnati agreed.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any such thing as rogue agents \u2014 there are some that aren\u2019t as competent as others, just like in any workplace,\u201d said Bonnie Esrig, a senior manager in the I.R.S. office who retired in January, in part over disagreements with other officials there.         \n\n\u201cI was not a happy camper leaving that organization,\u201d she added, \u201cand I can still say that I don\u2019t think there was malice behind it at all.\u201d         \n\nAdministering the nearly four-million-word federal tax code involves so many arcane legalities, and is so fraught with potential to ignite Washington\u2019s partisan skirmishes or infuriate taxpayers, that much of the I.R.S. is run by lawyers.
