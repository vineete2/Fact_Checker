{"headline": "Need Motivation? Declare a Deadline", "body": "\nAT a meeting last Tuesday, I told my colleagues that I would finish this column \u2014 which is about deadlines \u2014 by noon on Thursday. I spent part of Tuesday afternoon searching the word \u201cdeadlines\u201d on Google, but didn\u2019t make much progress. By late afternoon, I felt a tiny knot of fear in my stomach. What if I let my co-workers down? So I wrote something silly just to get started. This paragraph.         \n\nDuring my Googling I found out that  \n is an expert on deadlines, and I forced myself to contact him because I had promised to get this work done.         \n\nMaking that declaration was a good move, as it turns out. Publicly committing to meeting a deadline is a powerful motivator because it puts your reputation on the line, said Mr. Ariely, a professor of psychology and behavioral economics at Duke University and the  \n         \n\nWorkers who fail to meet deadlines risk the disapproval \u2014 and sometimes the wrath \u2014 of their managers and colleagues. Still, some people will blow a deadline, rationalizing that there is both a \u201cdeadline\u201d and a \u201creal deadline.\u201d They will use whatever devices and excuses they can muster to buy more time.         \n\nBut what about assignments that don\u2019t have clear deadlines? Or projects that are so large that they must be done in increments, so that pulling an all-nighter isn\u2019t an option? Or creative goals that no one much cares about, except you?         \n\nI know people who, through boundless narcissism, single-minded obsession or unfathomable self-discipline can complete big projects without deadlines. Many of us, though, need a looming threat to finish major work.         \n\nPeople respond well to deadlines because meeting them provides a distinct feeling of having achieved something within a time frame. \u201cIt\u2019s a good way to keep score,\u201d Professor Ariely said.         \n\nIt is possible to motivate yourself, he said, by announcing a deadline to others \u2014 perhaps on Facebook or on Twitter. Not meeting the deadline would then feel like breaking a promise, he said: \u201cIt does say something about your character.\u201d         \n\nA mere announcement on Twitter, though, would hardly be enough for die-hard procrastinators. If you are one of them, consider creating a situation that has real consequences, Professor Ariely said. Give a friend $100 and say, \u201cIf I don\u2019t meet my deadline you can keep this.\u201d Or, he said, try the prospect of public humiliation. Make a bet with your friends: if you don\u2019t meet the deadline, you must run through the streets naked.         \n\nPerhaps Professor Ariely has friends who really would force him to run naked through the streets of Durham, N.C. My friends are warm and supportive and would say \u201cthat\u2019s O.K.\u201d if I didn\u2019t meet my self-imposed deadline, which, of course, makes them wonderful friends but not good enforcers.         \n\nI have always wanted to write a book, however, and it occurs to me: Why not hire someone to hector me? Services like TaskRabbit have sprung up to help people with all manner of tasks, including fixing their computers and doing their laundry. Surely a stranger would be willing, for a small fee, to call or text me and say: \u201cHave you written those 500 words you said you would write by 8 a.m.?\u201d It\u2019s worth a try. A shaming e-mail if I don\u2019t do my assignment should be included in the price.         \n\nHere may be the secret to meeting a big self-imposed deadline: First, divide the work into smaller tasks and set deadlines for every one of them. Then find a tough and reliable person to hold you accountable for meeting each one. Make meeting the big deadline \u2014 not achieving perfection \u2014 the ultimate goal. Voil\u00e0. You\u2019re making no guarantees of quality, but perhaps your work can be improved later.         \n\nTHIS column, for example, is nowhere near as good as it was as a vague idea in my mind\u2019s eye. There\u2019s so much more I wanted to cover, including the  \n \u201cdeadline.\u201d (O.K., I\u2019ll throw it in: It was formerly \u201ca boundary around a military prison beyond which a prisoner could not venture without risk of being shot by the guards,\u201d according to  \n.)         \n\nI wanted to discuss the link between death and deadlines, and whether  \n, a topic that has been explored by Prof. Adam Grant, an organizational psychologist at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.         \n\nBut I ran out of time, and that\u2019s the point. This column \u2014 inferior though it is to what I had imagined \u2014 is done, and it\u2019s done because I had a deadline.
