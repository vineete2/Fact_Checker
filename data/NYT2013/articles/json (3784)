{"headline": "Default Threat Generates Fear Around Globe", "body": "\nLONDON \u2014 The bitter fiscal stalemate in Washington is producing nervous ripples from London to Bali, with increasing anxiety that the United States might actually default on a portion of its government debt, set off global financial troubles and undercut fragile economic recoveries in many countries.         \n\nFive years after the financial crisis in the United States helped spread a deep global recession, policy makers around the world again fear collateral damage, this time with their nations becoming victims not of Wall Street\u2019s excesses but of a political system in Washington that to many foreign eyes no longer seems to be able to function efficiently.         \n\nThere is plenty of evidence that the United States remains engaged globally on many levels, with  \n on targets in Africa this weekend the most recent. But the partial shutdown of the United States government has shown again that Washington\u2019s problems extend beyond American borders. Effectively grounded by the political crisis at home, President Obama was absent from a summit meeting of Pacific Rim leaders in Indonesia on Monday, giving China greater opportunity to highlight its role in the region.         \n\nOne of the attendees, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, provided a possibly sardonic statement of sympathy for Mr. Obama. \u201cWe see what is happening in U.S. domestic politics and this is not an easy situation,\u201d Mr. Putin said, adding, \u201cIf I was in his situation, I would not come, either.\u201d         \n\nIn Europe, the effort to reach a big new trade accord with the United States is at a standstill, with many government agencies in Washington operating with skeletal staffs. And as worrisome as that kind of delay is in Europe, it is only a precursor to the almost certain economic fallout if the United States does not raise the debt limit and defaults for the first time on government securities.         \n\nForeigners often complain, usually with some forbearance, that the United States is so powerful that its president is in some important sense their president, too. In their case, however, they lack the opportunity to cast a vote.         \n\nThere is not much that any foreigner can do about Mr. Obama\u2019s confrontation with the House speaker, John A. Boehner, who said Sunday that  \n \u2014 one with no conditions \u2014 that would raise the American debt limit before the government hits its borrowing limit and risks technical default as soon as next week. At the same time, Mr. Boehner has told colleagues privately that he would avert a default, but whether he actually has the ability to do so remains uncertain.         \n\n\u201cThe international community is asking, \u2018Does the U.S. still have the will to act?\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Xenia Dormandy, a senior fellow at London\u2019s Chatham House and a former American official in the State Department and the National Security Council under President George W. Bush.         \n\n\u201cBoth the Syria vote and the current budget crisis are nerve-racking for the world,\u201d she said, referring to Mr. Obama\u2019s sudden decision to ask Congress to authorize a strike on Syria and then changing his mind.         \n\nAlain Frachon, a columnist and former Washington correspondent for the French newspaper Le Monde, said, \u201cWashington is looking more like the Italian political system, with its permanent crises, and not a presidential system, as before.\u201d         \n\n\u201cPeople are worried about the debt ceiling \u2014 it could be the little drop that could trigger another crisis in financial markets,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s just when there was the perception for the first time in the long sovereign debt crisis that there is a window of opportunity to breathe a little bit, and to introduce a bit more suppleness into the way we\u2019ve managed it.\u201d         \n\nThe anxiety is all over Europe, Mr. Frachon said, and it comes just as Greece and Spain seem to be turning around, as there are spurts of growth that promise an end to recession, and as Germany has gotten through its elections and Rome through another political crisis. Another financial meltdown would hurt France, too, he said, not just Greece, Portugal and Spain.         \n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t want to see all this fragile equilibrium destabilized by a possible financial crisis provoked in Washington,\u201d he said.         \n\nJean-Paul Fitoussi, an economist at the Institut d\u2019\u00c9tudes Politiques de Paris, said a default would slow the American economy and depreciate the dollar, \u201cso it would lead to a loss of competitiveness in Europe at the very moment when all policies in Europe are aimed at increasing competitiveness, and that would be very bad news.\u201d         \n\nPerhaps worse, he said, is that \u201cthe banking system in Europe remains fragile, so more bad news could have unforeseen consequences on the world\u2019s financial system.\u201d         \n\nThe United States has gone through government shutdowns before, Mr. Fitoussi noted, but this time it feels different, even if it turns out to be short-lived.         \n\n\u201cPerhaps we have not completely understood the American Constitution, and the effective power of the president is not as strong as we believed,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd maybe it\u2019s because Obama is not using his constitutional power very well.\u201d         \n\nThe weekend military strikes on terrorist targets in Libya and Somalia are a perfect indication that the American government can act when its direct interests are at stake, said Ms. Dormandy of Chatham House. But the deeper question is whether a more insular, less globally active United States is emerging for the longer term, or is just a function of the Obama administration\u2019s reaction to events.         \n\n\u201cThe jury is still out,\u201d Ms. Dormandy said, \u201cbut I would say it seems like a more profound transition.\u201d         \n\nAlexander Lambsdorff, a member of the European Parliament for the German Free Democratic Party, sees a possible benefit for the euro and the euro zone if the United States defaults, however briefly. Investors will seek an alternative to the dollar in German, Dutch and Finnish bonds, he said. \u201cIf European leaders have proven one thing,\u201d he said, \u201cit is their resolve to keep the euro afloat and their countries out of default.\u201d         \n\nMr. Lambsdorff said that he admires the United States Constitution, but that the founders never imagined \u201ca media democracy.\u201d The weakness of the American system is in the constant political campaigning required for the House of Representatives, he said.         \n\n\u201cIn the permanent campaign mode the representatives find themselves, there is an incentive to be more radical and less compromising,\u201d he said. \u201cBut no democracy works without compromise, and if compromise starts to be elusive, then a democratic system has to rethink itself.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/08/us/politics/default-threat-makes-impasse-in-washington-a-global-fear.html", "date": "2013-10-07", "description": "Five years after a financial crisis in the United States helped spread a deep global recession, much of the world again fears collateral damage."}
