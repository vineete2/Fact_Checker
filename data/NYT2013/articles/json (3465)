{"headline": "No Morsel Too Minuscule for All-Consuming N.S.A.", "body": "\nWhen Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, sat down with President Obama at the White House in April to  \n Syrian chemical weapons, Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and  \n, it was a cordial, routine exchange.         \n\nThe  \n nonetheless went to work in advance and intercepted Mr. Ban\u2019s talking points for the meeting, a feat the agency later reported as an \u201coperational highlight\u201d in a weekly internal brag sheet. It is hard to imagine what edge this could have given Mr. Obama in a friendly chat, if he even saw the N.S.A.\u2019s modest scoop. (The White House won\u2019t say.)         \n\nBut it was emblematic of an agency that for decades has operated on the principle that any eavesdropping that can be done on a foreign target of any conceivable interest \u2014 now or in the future \u2014 should be done. After all, American intelligence officials reasoned, who\u2019s going to find out?         \n\nFrom thousands of classified documents, the National Security Agency emerges as an electronic omnivore of staggering capabilities, eavesdropping and hacking its way around the world to strip governments and other targets of their secrets, all the while enforcing the utmost secrecy about its own operations. It spies routinely on  \n as well as foes, as has become obvious in recent weeks; the agency\u2019s official mission list includes using its surveillance powers to achieve \u201cdiplomatic advantage\u201d over such allies as France and Germany and \u201ceconomic advantage\u201d over Japan and Brazil, among other countries.         \n\nMr. Obama found himself in September standing uncomfortably beside the president of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, who was furious at being named as a target of N.S.A. eavesdropping. Since then, there has been a parade of such protests, from the European Union, Mexico, France, Germany and Spain. Chagrined American officials joke that soon there will be complaints from foreign leaders feeling slighted because the agency had not targeted them.         \n\nJames R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, has repeatedly dismissed such objections as brazen hypocrisy from countries that do their own share of spying. But in a recent interview, he acknowledged that the scale of eavesdropping by the N.S.A., with 35,000 workers and $10.8 billion a year, sets it apart. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that from a capability standpoint we probably dwarf everybody on the planet, just about, with perhaps the exception of Russia and China,\u201d he said.         \n\nSince Edward J. Snowden began  \n the agency\u2019s documents in June, the unrelenting stream of disclosures has opened the most extended debate on the agency\u2019s mission since its creation in 1952. The scrutiny has ignited a crisis of purpose and legitimacy for the N.S.A., the nation\u2019s largest intelligence agency, and the White House has ordered a review of both its domestic and its foreign intelligence collection. While much of the focus has been on whether the agency violates Americans\u2019 privacy, an issue under examination by Congress and two review panels, the anger expressed around the world about American surveillance has prompted far broader questions.         \n\nIf secrecy can no longer be taken for granted, when does the political risk of eavesdropping overseas outweigh its intelligence benefits? Should foreign citizens, many of whom now rely on American companies for email and Internet services, have any privacy protections from the N.S.A.? Will the American Internet giants\u2019 collaboration with the agency, voluntary or otherwise, damage them in international markets? And are the agency\u2019s clandestine efforts to weaken encryption making the Internet less secure for everyone?         \n\nMatthew M. Aid, an intelligence historian and author of a 2009 book on the N.S.A., said there is no precedent for the hostile questions coming at the agency from all directions.         \n\n\u201cFrom N.S.A.\u2019s point of view, it\u2019s a disaster,\u201d Mr. Aid said. \u201cEvery new disclosure reinforces the notion that the agency needs to be reined in. There are political consequences, and there will be operational consequences.\u201d         \n\nA review of classified agency documents obtained by Mr. Snowden and shared with The New York Times by  \n, offers a rich sampling of the agency\u2019s global operations and culture. (At the agency\u2019s request, The Times is withholding some details that officials said could compromise intelligence operations.) The N.S.A. seems to be listening everywhere in the world, gathering every stray electron that might add, however minutely, to the United States government\u2019s knowledge of the world. To some Americans, that may be a comfort. To others, and to people overseas, that may suggest an agency out of control.
