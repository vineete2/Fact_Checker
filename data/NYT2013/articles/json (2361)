{"headline": "Amid Much Tumult, France Approves \u2018Marriage for All\u2019", "body": "\nPARIS \u2014 With a definitive vote by the lower house of Parliament,  \n on Tuesday became the world\u2019s 14th nation, and the third in just two weeks, to approve marriage rights for same-sex couples.         \n\nThe legislation is expected to be approved by the Constitutional Council and signed into law by President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande in time to allow the country\u2019s first same-sex weddings this summer.         \n\nPassage of the \u201cmarriage for all\u201d law, sponsored by Mr. Hollande, a Socialist, came after months of sometimes angry debate and a series of major protests, rallies that drew Roman Catholics from France\u2019s rural regions and received the backing of Christian, Jewish and Muslim religious leaders, as well as the conservative political opposition. Homophobic violence had risen in recent weeks, with a handful of attacks on gay couples reported across the country.         \n\nThe legislation was approved by  \n in the National Assembly, the lower house, where the left holds a strong majority. Eleven legislators from the center and right broke with party lines to support the law, though there were indications that some of those votes may have been cast by mistake. There were 10 abstentions.         \n\n\u201cIt is a generous text that you\u2019ve voted for today,\u201d Justice Minister Christiane Taubira told legislators on Tuesday evening, calling the law a \u201cvery beautiful reform.\u201d         \n\nOpposition to the law, which also opens adoption to same-sex couples, remained strong and vocal even after the vote. Members of Parliament from the country\u2019s main opposition party, the center-right Union for a Popular Movement, had earlier announced that they would challenge the legality of the new law before the Constitutional Council, a high court that rules on matters of constitutionality. And organizers for an opposition movement called  \n, or Protest for All, said they intended to continue to demonstrate.         \n\nOn Tuesday night, hundreds of demonstrators converged on the National Assembly, where opponents have held daily protests. Several dozen violent protesters, some wearing balaclavas, clashed with the riot police there, French news media reported, but most remained peaceful.         \n\nHundreds of thousands of demonstrators have marched across France to protest the law, with much of their attention focused on adoption by gay couples; opponents have deplored what they call a threat to the foundations of French society and an injustice for children who will be raised by parents of the same sex. The tagline for La Manif Pour Tous reads, \u201cAll born from a man and a woman.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThis democratically approved law is unjust and, by not respecting the rights of the most vulnerable citizens, it harms democracy,\u201d said Tugdual Derville, a spokesman for La Manif Pour Tous. Mr. Derville vowed to continue opposing the law \u2014 but also homophobia \u2014 with \u201cpeaceful firmness.\u201d         \n\nBackers of the legislation said it rectified an unjust and discriminatory status quo without impinging upon the rights of heterosexuals.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s rare that equality and love win out in such a clear manner,\u201d said Guillaume Bonnet, a French spokesman for  \n, an international gay rights group. Watching the vote on television on Tuesday, \u201cI felt that my children, my grandchildren were going to remember this,\u201d said Mr. Bonnet, who is gay.         \n\nWhile rapid enactment seems almost certain, there is precedent for the Constitutional Council to reject a legal text prepared by Mr. Hollande\u2019s government. In December, the court rejected legislation that would have created a 75 percent marginal tax rate on incomes of more than one million euros, or about $1.3 million; that legal text failed to account for the fact that French income tax is levied on households, not individuals.         \n\nMr. Hollande\u2019s junior minister for the family, Dominique Bertinotti, said Tuesday that the government had been careful to avoid any \u201clegal fragility\u201d in the text of the marriage bill. In a 2011 decision, the court found that it was not its role to rule on the legal boundaries of marriage.         \n\nSome conservative lawmakers have suggested overturning the law should they find themselves with a parliamentary majority, but it remains unlikely that they will try to do so, despite their recent vocal opposition. Opinion polling has consistently shown that a strong majority of French support marriage rights for same-sex couples, though the country remains more evenly split on the matter of adoption.
