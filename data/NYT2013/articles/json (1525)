{"headline": "Beauty on the Comeback Trail", "body": "\nMany people are waiting for the  \n next year of the High Bridge\u2019s pedestrian walkway across the Harlem River.         \n\nHowever delightful the Sunday promenade 140 feet up will be, the experience cannot compare to the original grandeur of the bridge itself, an engineering marvel when it was completed in 1848 to carry the Croton Aqueduct from the  \n to  \n. But it suffered a grievous blow in the 1920s, when some of its soaring granite piers were knocked out to widen the channel for river traffic, sparking one of New York\u2019s earliest preservation battles \u2014 like many others since, unsuccessful.         \n\nWhen the bridge was proposed, two options for carrying the aqueduct across the Harlem River emerged: a low, solid bridge with a single arch in the middle, and a high bridge supported by individual piers.         \n\nIn his 2000 book \u201cWater for Gotham,\u201d Gerard T. Koeppel gives a full account of the schools of thought. Economy militated in favor of a low bridge, at 50 feet just high enough for most vessels to pass underneath. But the low bridge plan was bitterly opposed by investors who had staked money on creating a canal\u00a0up the Harlem River over\u00a0to the Hudson.\u00a0They protested any possible obstruction, even ramming and damaging an early version of the Macombs Dam Bridge farther south.         \n\nKoeppel quotes John B. Jervis, the aqueduct\u2019s engineer, as saying that \u201cengineers are prone to gratify a taste for the magnificent.\u201d Nevertheless, Jervis was opposed to a high bridge because of the cost difference, $835,000 rather than $425,000.         \n\nDespite that, however, high beat low, and a series of 15 soaring arches was built from shore to shore, with a pedestrian walkway on top, 1,450 feet long, with a clearance of 114 feet over the river.         \n\nThe New York Evening Post called it \u201cone of the hydraulic wonders of the new world.\u201d The High Bridge originally had a geyser at one end, praised by one George Schuyler in a letter published by The Morning Courier for spewing \u201cits enlivening waters to the delight of visitors to this stupendous work.\u201d         \n\nAnd, with rail ferry connections, visit they did, although the sweeping view did not just inspire admiration. There were some suicides, but often people who jumped had another goal in mind. In 1880 The National Police Gazette reported that Robert Donaldson, of \u201csplendid physique,\u201d attracted a crowd that \u201ccheered loudly\u201d as he jumped, while boats sounded their whistles and horns.\u00a0He told The Times he would jump from any bridge in America over flat water for $500, and the newspaper helpfully mentioned that he was always to be found at Johnnie Hampson\u2019s saloon at 46 West Third Street.         \n\nThe New York Press reported what seems a suicide scenario on July 6, 1902. Henry Clark, 45, jumped with a letter in his pocket that the newspaper quoted as saying: \u201cIt\u2019s all over. I am no use to God or man. So here goes nobody.\u201d Mr. Clark, The Press said, was mortally injured.         \n\nHowever, a simultaneous account in The Rochester Democrat Chronicle, also published on July 6, has it that Mr. Clark, although indeed depressed, was determined to develop a reputation as a bridge jumper. The Rochester paper recounts his words as he leapt off as, \u201cHere goes nothing.\u201d         \n\nAfterward, the Rochester paper said he had not been seriously injured, and that according to him, his successful jump meant \u201cit will be easy for me to make a living.\u201d Indeed, he may never have had another financial care: The  \n Standard Union on July 7 reported that he had died in the hospital.         \n\nAnd there were other species of reckless visitor, as in 1904 when The New York Times reported \u201cToughs Bombard  \n Oarsmen With Stones.\u201d         \n\nDuring World War I, the Army Corps of Engineers decided that the piers posed a hazard to navigation on the Harlem, which had been enlarged for shipping, and ordered the removal of some of them. The suggestion evolved into a proposal to demolish the bridge: the aqueduct was operating but not essential. But in 1922 the American Association of Engineers went to bat for the bridge, saying that tearing it down would be \u201can act of savagery.\u201d         \n\nIt may be that demolition was more expensive than knocking out a few pins. In any event, in 1928 the center five spans were replaced with a workmanlike steel arch \u2014 bitter weeds for anyone familiar with the Roman dignity of the original.         \n\nThe High Bridge still served as a walkway, but as the city slid into midcentury decay, it became yet another public space that seemed not worth the trouble to police, and it closed around 1970. The  \n have promoted its recognition and improvement in  \n and the Bronx, and have been active in bringing the walkway back on line.         \n\nWork is under way on what should still be a majestic view of the Harlem River valley, to be compromised somewhat by an eight-foot-high steel fence, to deter the toughs of the 21st century. At the moment, the closest approach in Manhattan is in Highbridge Park, around 173rd Street, and in the Bronx at University Avenue and 170th Street.         \n\n\u00a0 To see the bridge from a distance, the engineering pilgrim can brush by the piers at speed on the north- and southbound Major Deegan Expressway.         \n\nBut a more contemplative view can be had from Depot Place, a tiny stub off Sedgwick Avenue just south of the bridge. There, the granite piers start out from the Bronx shore in perfect majesty, only to be brought to an unseemly halt at the river.
