{"headline": "Pickles Aplenty at This Upper East Side Hangout", "body": "\nSometimes, a pickle runs through it.         \n\nAt the \n on the Upper East Side, the menu offers fried McClure\u2019s pickles (beer-battered and look like Dunkin Munchkins, though much tastier), on the side of a fine burger, and to be imbibed in a Dirty Pickle Martini made with Tito\u2019s vodka and brine that sports some spice.         \n\nAs good and bracing as the martini may be, the Penrose does not strictly fit the profile of an ideal place to have a quiet drink. Like several of its siblings (Wilfie & Nell in the West Village and the Wren on the Bowery are two of them), this is an establishment that is known to bring on the noise, bring on the scrum. Those in search of minimal noise need to time their visits.         \n\nIt\u2019s worth a shot. The Penrose clearly places a priority on serving good beer, interesting cocktails from a compact list, whiskeys that aren\u2019t in everyday lineups, and food made with high-quality ingredients.         \n\nWith a simple game plan \u2014 a night early in the week, at 7-ish \u2014 it can work out just fine. Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays, the volume is definitely pumped up, and after 9:30 we can make no promises.         \n\nAlthough there is plenty of chatter and clinking, it\u2019s easy to have a conversation here before the crowds arrive. It\u2019s loud enough that no one can really eavesdrop without being incredibly obvious \u2014 even if you\u2019re sitting at one of the long communal tables \u2014 but not so noisy that you can\u2019t hear the person sitting across from you. There are no televisions.         \n\nThe biggest noises of the night came from subway construction on Second Avenue, and the Xlerator in the washroom, possibly the nation\u2019s loudest hand dryer.         \n\nIt\u2019s a welcoming place. Though It has only been open since last June, like Wilfie & Nell, it feels pleasantly lived-in: brick walls; a selection of stools, tables and expansive booths; some old-looking stuff in frames on the walls (it seems safe to say that no one will ever go to the Penrose to study the art), wooden floors that appear to have seen some traffic.         \n\nOn tap, there\u2019s Murphy\u2019s Stout from Ireland ($7), Green Flash I.P.A. from San Diego ($7) and Sixpoint\u2019s Tenement Ale from Brooklyn ($7). The Old Pal Spencer ($11, the price for all cocktails here), a waiter\u2019s recommendation, is a praiseworthy variation on a Manhattan, with Bulleit bourbon, Aperol, Dolin Rouge vermouth, and bitters.         \n\nThe burger ($12) is made with Pat LaFrieda beef, the first-rate macaroni and cheese ($10) with Irish Cheddar and, for an extra $1, applewood bacon.         \n\nFor after \u2014 because it does not seem right to rush out (assuming the noise level hasn\u2019t soared) \u2014 there\u2019s a glass of Auchentoshan 3 Wood ($14) or, from Ireland, the seriously smoky Knappogue Castle 12 Year ($11).         \n\nAnd after those, the reasonable check is delivered in a folder marked \u201cThe Damage.\u201d It is not accompanied by anything pickled, but you would not be unhappy if it were.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/29/booming/pickles-aplenty-at-this-upper-east-side-hangout.html", "date": "2013-03-28", "description": "With a simple game plan \u2014 a night early in the week \u2014 the Penrose on the Upper East Side can be a fine place for brine-accented food and drink."}
