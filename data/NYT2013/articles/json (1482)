{"headline": "Exiting, Stage Center", "body": "\n \n is leaving New York.         \n\nThat is not last month\u2019s news, it is simply her agenda for this early spring day: a trip to the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark, where she is to sit on a stage and chat about her career, first as a Broadway scene-stealer, more recently as a cabaret regular and a guest star on sitcoms like \u201c30 Rock.\u201d         \n\nIt is only 10:30 a.m., and already there is trouble. The limousine service sent a sport utility vehicle to the Carlyle Hotel, where she lives. She had it sent back.         \n\nNow, a black Cadillac sedan is idling at the curb. Forty-five minutes tick by on the gold clock above the Carlyle\u2019s front desk. Ms. Stritch emerges from the elevator looking fragile. A hip replacement after a fall several months ago has forced her to use a cane. Hunter Ryan Herdlicka, a 26-year-old actor with leading-man good looks who has become her de facto factotum, is at her side. A maid trails behind.         \n\nBut Ms. Stritch\u2019s health problems \u2014 diabetes, an eye injury and the new hip \u2014 have not dimmed her determination or softened her intensity. She manages to sweep through the lobby as if she were leading a royal procession. \u201cYou\u2019re sticking to me like glue,\u201d she half-shouts when she sees a reporter in the lobby who has been assigned to do just that.         \n\nThe procession moves on. The famous blast of a voice, still powerful enough to hold a note the way Ethel Merman did, is now addressing the wider world as Ms. Stritch swirls through the Carlyle\u2019s revolving door and settles into the Cadillac.         \n\nAnd then, the unthinkable happens. The driver takes her to the wrong place, not to the arts center in Newark but to one in Englewood, N.J., that Mr. Herdlicka says is locked up tight.         \n\nHearing a moment-by-moment account of all this later, the pianist and singer Michael Feinstein, a longtime friend of Ms. Stritch\u2019s, asks: \u201cAnd was there a moment of Medea-like rage?\u201d         \n\nThere was. A long moment. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have wanted to be in that car,\u201d said Mr. Herdlicka, who was.         \n\nIt is a quintessential New York celebrity story about a quintessential New York character. After a hard-driving, hard-drinking life, Ms. Stritch is irascible and indomitable and, to theatergoers or cabaret devotees of a certain age or mind-set, irresistible. \u201cIf she isn\u2019t the classic New York dame, I don\u2019t know who is,\u201d said Peg Breen, the president of the  \n, which declared Ms. Stritch a Living Landmark in 2003.         \n\nSo the announcement in March that she was  \n for good had a say-it-isn\u2019t-so quality. To her devotees, Elaine Stritch\u2019s decamping to the Detroit area is probably as devastating as the Dodgers\u2019 departing from Ebbets Field. New York just will not be the same wacky place without her and her elegance and earthiness.         \n\n\u201cShe\u2019s like Sardi\u2019s,\u201d said the actor Cheyenne Jackson, who appeared with Ms. Stritch on \u201c30 Rock.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s an institution. She\u2019s the lady with the hat who shouts, who is funny, who is quick with a comeback.\u201d         \n\nElaine Stritch\u2019s New York is the New York of \u201cThere\u2019s No Business Like Show Business\u201d \u2014 the costumes, the scenery, the makeup, the props, the audience that lifts you when you are down. But it is also the New York of sophisticated Stephen Sondheim lyrics and Edward Albee plays; of Elaine\u2019s, the restaurant where Ms. Stritch was a bartender one summer in the 1960s; of the Carlyle and fixtures like Bobby Short, the urbane pianist and singer; of boldface names and gossip columns and Ms. Stritch\u2019s friend Liz Smith, who says of Ms. Stritch, \u201cOf course she was just fabulous copy for me.\u201d         \n\nBut that world is disappearing, and her exit could be another end-of-an-era milestone. Mr. Short, who appeared at the Caf\u00e9 Carlyle for more than 30 years, died in 2005. The New York Post dropped Ms. Smith in 2009, though her columns now appear on the Web and in newspapers elsewhere. Gone, too, are Elaine\u2019s, the restaurant, and its owner, Elaine Kaufman, who died at the end of 2010. And now, Ms. Stritch is headed to the Midwest. But not before one final round of applause.         \n\nOn the opening night of \u201cElaine Stritch at the Carlyle: Movin\u2019 Over and Out,\u201d her one-woman valedictory that was to run through Saturday night, she sang only three songs, and at times she struggled with stories and lyrics. But the personality was on full display as she played up to someone she said she had been told was in the audience. \u201cThis is an evening with Tom Hanks,\u201d she joked early on.
