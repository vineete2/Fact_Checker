{"headline": "With Cows in Mind, Swiss Farmers Wage Litter Battle", "body": "\nSOLOTHURN, Switzerland \u2014 Before he mows the hay he feeds his dairy cows, Hansueli Wyss performs a new ritual: He scours the fields of his 65-acre farm amid the rolling hills of this farming region, dotted with steep-roofed homes like his 150-year-old farmhouse, for junk \u2014 empty bottles and soda or beer cans, hamburger cartons, and much else.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s plastic bags, aluminum cans,\u201d said Mr. Wyss, 50, who reared three children on the farm. \u201cI make an effort to keep an eye on the cows, on the fields, but my machines shred this stuff in with the hay and the silage. That\u2019s where the problem begins.\u201d         \n\nHard as it might be to believe, the orderly Swiss have a litter problem. Oddly, though, it is not in their towns and cities, where you might sooner stumble over a meteorite than a flattened Coke can or empty cigarette pack.         \n\nOut in the countryside here southwest of Basel, it is another story. So much litter is tossed out of cars that Swiss farmers have begun a campaign to fight it. They complain not just about the mess but about the danger the refuse poses to livestock.         \n\nLitter can be fatal to ruminants. Four years ago, when one of Mr. Wyss\u2019s cows died, he was convinced the cause was litter it ingested by accident. \u201cThe problem is, a cow\u2019s stomach cannot always handle metal or glass,\u201d he said. Farmers or their veterinarians sometimes use magnets to draw out metal objects like screws or nails before they damage a cow\u2019s stomach, but magnets are useless with shredded aluminum, he said.         \n\nThe problem persists, he said, and the litter basket overflowed in July of last year when six cows of a neighboring farmer had to be slaughtered after ingesting something that caused fever and a sharp drop in their milk output.         \n\n\u201cIt was never proven scientifically, but the assumption was that it was the result of an aluminum can, or something similar,\u201d said Urs Schneider, deputy director of the Swiss Farmers Union, in the capital, Bern, a half-hour\u2019s drive south of here. \u201cThere was enormous national attention, even lacking hard proof.\u201d         \n\nFarmers hereabout are convinced that aluminum cans, or even glass bottles, tossed onto a field are picked up by harvesting machines, shredded and mixed in with hay or silage. Once swallowed by the unsuspecting cows, the shreds can prove fatal.         \n\n\u201cWe get an awful lot of reports,\u201d Mr. Schneider went on. \u201cIn the last four to five years, particularly along heavily trafficked roads, the problem has gotten continuously worse.\u201d         \n\nAfter the slaughter of their neighbor\u2019s six cows, farmers like Mr. Wyss, who keeps about 40 cows, a mixed breed of Simmental and Red Holstein, demanded action. A local farmers union, a branch of Mr. Schneider\u2019s national association, came up with the idea for a campaign against litter in the countryside, and the plan attracted followers everywhere.         \n\n\u201cWhat was essential for me,\u201d said Peter Br\u00fcgger, the local branch secretary, \u201cwas the way the public reacted to the news of the cows\u2019 slaughter, and now in all of Switzerland.\u201d He contacted two neighboring cantons, whose farmers immediately supported the idea for a campaign, which soon spread nationwide.         \n\nThe idea of cows dying of litter hit a nerve. Certainly, the Swiss cow does not enjoy the aura of sanctity of its Indian counterpart. Yet cows produce the cheeses, like Emmentaler and Gruy\u00e8re, that are central to the Swiss way of life; cows dot the Swiss countryside as assuredly as do charming chalets and pointed church steeples.         \n\nMost alarming to many Swiss was the idea that they might be a nation of litterers. And there is no mistaking that the culprits are Swiss, not tourists or immigrant workers, farmers say. \u201cFor once it\u2019s not the foreigners,\u201d Daniel Marti, who works for the local farmers association, said with a laugh.         \n\nSo last spring the national farmers association, together with antilitter groups, started a drive to alert the average Swiss to the dangers caused when bottles, cans, plastic bags or packaging is tossed thoughtlessly out car windows. Posters were distributed, like one featuring an orphaned calf bemoaning the death of a mother cow, over the words, \u201cLitter Kills Animals.\u201d Another, lighter in tone, shows a bottle tossed from a car window hitting a cow on the rump, with the text, \u201cLitter Makes Me Sick.\u201d         \n\nSome companies that are the source of considerable litter, like McDonald\u2019s and TetraPak, actively support antilitter groups. While the posters went up along roads throughout Switzerland, volunteers visited schools to alert children to just how dangerous a bottle or a can may be for a cow. The farmers are also seeking tougher antilitter laws and deposits on cans, a measure that retailers generally oppose.         \n\nThe farmers say it is not just about dead animals. Though no studies exist, the estimated cost to them in time and money to rid their fields of litter before seeding or harvesting \u201cgoes into the millions,\u201d Mr. Schneider said.         \n\nNot everyone is convinced the campaign is working. \u201cI think the results are about equal to zero,\u201d said Erich Walker, 58, who reared six children on his 205-acre farm, where he raises cows, pigs and chickens and grows corn, sugar beets and wheat. Yet he conceded the efforts might \u201csensitize people a bit.\u201d         \n\nOthers are more optimistic. \u201cOne shouldn\u2019t dramatize,\u201d Mr. Schneider said. \u201cThe Swiss sense of order remains strong.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/world/europe/with-cows-in-mind-swiss-farmers-wage-litter-battle.html", "date": "2013-11-04", "description": "A traditionally tidy nation is being alerted to the danger, sometimes fatal, that refuse poses to livestock."}
