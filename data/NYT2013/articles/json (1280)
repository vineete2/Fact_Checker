{"headline": "Sun City It\u2019s Not", "body": "\nWhen the co-op conversion wave began in  \n in the 1960s, singles and young married couples flocked to the Upper West Side hoping to get a piece of the action. Some of those people, now in their 70s, are still there, cemented in place by apartments bought for a song or equally treasured rent-stabilized units.         \n\n\u201cThe kids have left,\u201d said Aaron Shmulewitz, whose law firm, Belkin Burden Wenig & Goldman, represents more than 250 of the city\u2019s co-op and condo boards. \u201cThe dog has died. But these people stayed put.\u201d         \n\nAs the neighborhood\u2019s population has grayed, some apartment houses have morphed into what social scientists call NORCs \u2014 naturally occurring retirement communities. The most recent census estimates indicate that 22 percent of Upper West Siders, or 46,000 people, are 60 or older, compared with the citywide average of 17 percent. Attracted by convenient shopping, abundant mass transit and a wealth of cultural activities, many older residents hope to remain in their apartments the rest of their lives.         \n\nMost programs tailored to this population are found in public housing projects and buildings like Mitchell-Lama developments, where the government helps keep rents low. In many such complexes, so-called NORC programs financed with city and state money provide services including on-site social workers, escorts to medical appointments, and classes, lectures and workshops on issues of interest to the elderly.         \n\nPrivately run buildings typically have a tougher time providing similar programs, in part because they lack the necessary financial resources. There is also a problem of perception. A young family might be wary of renting in a building where older residents attend chair yoga classes in the lobby, the same way empty nesters might avoid a co-op where the library has been transformed into a playroom.         \n\nSome boards struggle with the need to provide services to favor an aging population. Stories are told, for instance, about buildings that refuse to allow ramps or handrails in their exquisite Art Deco lobbies, even though a gleaming marble floor can be a slippery hazard to an older person negotiating a walker.         \n\nSteven Wagner, whose firm, Wagner Davis, represents co-op and condo boards, recalled a case in  \n involving an older resident who had trouble navigating the steps to the basement laundry room. He presented the issue to the co-op and condo committee of the New York City Bar Association, and solutions included having the board pay to send out the resident\u2019s laundry. In the end, the co-op board agreed to install grab rails along the steps.         \n\n\u201cWe advise boards to try to be as sensitive as possible to people unable to care for themselves,\u201d Mr. Shmulewitz said. \u201cBecause there but for the grace of God go us.\u201d         \n\nSome buildings try hard to balance the needs of different populations, even on a tight budget.         \n\nGrassroots efforts to serve this exploding population \u2014 the first wave of baby boomers has already turned 65 \u2014 range from help buying groceries to informational programs on the complexities of  \n. And they win enthusiastic praise.         \n\n\u201cThese programs present challenges,\u201d said  \n, the director of the Aging in Place Initiative of the United Hospital Fund and creator of the city\u2019s first government-funded NORC program, at Penn South, an income-restricted co-op in Chelsea. \u201cBut there\u2019s no question that they can have a profound effect on the quality of life for older people, by helping them stay in their homes for as long as possible, as well as having a positive impact on the overall community. And that\u2019s a huge public benefit.\u201d         \n\nOne of the earliest examples of a privately run program was created at Lincoln Towers, a cluster of beige brick high-rises in the West 60s that is home to more than 9,000 people in 4,000 apartments. Built as a rent-stabilized complex in the 1960s, the buildings went co-op in 1987.  \n, which grew out of the Lincoln Towers tenants association, was born three years later. Janice Hohenstein, who moved into 170 West End Avenue on Aug. 1, 1965, the day it opened, and will be 92 come July, was one of the two founders.         \n\nSome 40 percent of Lincoln Towers\u2019 residents are over 60; some are in their 80s and 90s. Many are single and live in the starter units to which they moved decades ago. The group\u2019s Web site suggests the range and intensity of their concerns: \u201cWho will help me in an emergency?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m alone most of the time, my spouse, my friends are gone.\u201d \u201cMy bills get more and more confusing and overwhelming.\u201d         \n\nWith the help of  \n, a social services organization, Project Open tries to meet their needs, emotional as well as physical. One of the most popular events is the Wednesday-night class taught by a retired classics professor, which has up to 50 people reading plays by Aeschylus. The monthly blood-pressure checks, equally well attended, are administered in Project Open\u2019s office, a cinder-block space outfitted with card tables and folding chairs.
