{"headline": "When Hollywood Wants Good, Clean Fun, It Goes to Mormon Country", "body": "\nAllen Ostergar stood at the front of the lecture hall with a stiff and bashful smile, or maybe it was just stage fright, and started his pitch. Open on a deadly pirate ship, he said\u2014 \u201cthe deadliest of all the pirate ships to, like, sail the seas.\u201d         \n\nIt was a Tuesday evening at  \n, in Provo, Utah, and the school\u2019s computer-animation program had assembled its 70-odd students to choose their next project \u2014 the one film they would be producing over the next three semesters. Ostergar, a junior from Southern California, was up first.         \n\nA panning shot across the ship\u2019s deck, he explained, would introduce the thuggish crew: two pirates take turns slugging each other in the gut. Another stands around eating habanero peppers and blowing fire. \u201cOne idea I had,\u201d Ostergar said, \u201cwas one guy could be bench-pressing a cannon. And then it zooms out a little bit, and then there\u2019s a  \nguy that\u2019s bench-pressing  \n guy!\u201d         \n\nEventually the camera would zero in on the main character, Off-White Dakin. Ostergar had done an animated sequence showing the lantern-jawed pirate sitting behind a barrel \u2014 hiding. He was knitting a sweater, using his hook-hand and a rusty nail for needles. The sweater was pink and had a rainbow on it. This was Off-White\u2019s secret shame: \u201cHe only knits really cute things,\u201d Ostergar said. \u201cIt\u2019s his way to decompress.\u201d         \n\nThe film\u2019s premise sounded fun and wry and a little hokey. It was aiming for that Pixar-ish sweet spot, which is typical of the animated shorts that B.Y.U. students have made every year since the program started in 2000. (See, for example, \u2018\u2018 \n,\u201d about two anthropomorphic pi\u00f1atas who, having been hoisted up at a child\u2019s birthday party, panic and reconsider their careers.) Those films have consistently racked up student Emmys and student Academy Awards. They\u2019ve played at Cannes and Sundance. Most important, they\u2019ve impressed recruiters. Out of nowhere, B.Y.U. \u2014 a Mormon university owned and operated by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints \u2014 has become a farm team for the country\u2019s top animation studios and effects companies. Unlikely as it sounds, young Mormons are being sucked out of the middle of Utah and into the very centers of American pop-culture manufacturing.         \n\nPraising the program in a speech on campus in 2008, the president of Pixar, Edwin Catmull, noted: \u201cIt\u2019s the perception not just of Pixar, but also at the other studios, that something pretty remarkable is happening here.\u201d (During the production of \u201cBrave,\u201d for example, a 14-person team tasked with rigging the complicated musculature in horses and wrangling Princess Merida\u2019s curls included six B.Y.U. alumni.) Once Catmull\u2019s speech circulated online, prospective students from around the world started e-mailing the director of B.Y.U.\u2019s program, R. Brent Adams, wanting to apply. Adams did what he always does. He sent each a link to the university\u2019s honor code. Students must regularly attend church services. No sex outside of marriage. (\u201cLive a chaste and virtuous life.\u201d) No alcohol or coffee. (There aren\u2019t even caffeinated sodas in the vending machines.) No swearing. No deviations from the university\u2019s meticulous grooming standards. (\u201cIf a yearly beard exception is granted, a new Student ID will be issued after the beard has been fully grown and must be renewed every year by repeating the process.\u201d) Adams told me: \u201cI never heard from any of those people again.\u201d         \n\nThe typical B.Y.U. student doesn\u2019t seem like a natural fit for Hollywood. Mormon culture tends to see the entertainment industry as both a reflection of and contributor to our \u201cmorally bereft society,\u201d as one alumnus put it. Many of the students I met rarely, if ever, watch R-rated films and could name the handful of exceptions they had made. One 27-year-old junior remembered seeing the Civil War drama \u201cGlory\u201d in high school. Another was working part time at a company in Salt Lake City that cleaned up Hollywood films and released family-friendly versions on DVD. Recently, the student told me, he digitally replaced a cigarette in a character\u2019s hand with a pretzel.         \n\nThe B.Y.U. program is designed to be a similar kind of ethical counterweight: it\u2019s trying to unleash values-oriented filmmakers into the industry who can inflect its sensibility. \u201cWithout being preachy about it,\u201d Adams told me, \u201cif we can add something to the culture that makes people think about being better human beings \u2014 more productive, more kind, more forgiving \u2014 that\u2019s what we want to do.\u201d         \n\nAt first, I struggled to understand the specifics of that mission. Everyone talked about wanting to make \u201cclean movies\u201d or \u201cmovies I wouldn\u2019t be afraid to take my mother to,\u201d but these phrases were shibboleths, loaded and tough to pin down. It wasn\u2019t simply a matter of avoiding sex and violence. (A few times, I heard even \u201cShrek\u201d described disapprovingly: too many fart jokes, too much cynicism.) There was, instead, a fixation on whether you walked away from the movie feeling uplifted. That question superseded everything, even the usual genre and age-demographic lines. A senior, Megan Lloyd, told me: \u201cI just saw \u2018The Dark Knight.\u2019 It was wonderful, but it\u2019s just so dark. I didn\u2019t feel better about myself after I saw it. Instead, I felt like, I\u2019m a horrible human being \u2014 like all human beings are. Now,\u201d she went on, nearly in the same breath, \u201ccontrast that with a film like \u2018Wreck-It Ralph.\u2019 That teaches you: Hey, you can be a better person. Here\u2019s how!\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/26/magazine/when-hollywood-wants-good-clean-fun-it-goes-to-mormon-country.html", "date": "2013-05-23", "description": "B.Y.U.\u2019s animation program is not your typical film school.
