{"headline": "Yankees\u2019 Best Deal Might Be Letting Cano Go", "body": "\nThe  \n have gotten nine excellent seasons and one championship from  \n. They have paid him about $58 million. Now he wants that much again, and about $250 million more, for a decade that almost certainly will not be as productive.         \n\nThis is familiar territory for the Yankees, who caved to  \n six years ago, bidding against themselves after talking tough. It was a foolish deal that turned into a fiasco, with Wednesday\u2019s walkout from a grievance hearing the latest sideshow in Rodriguez\u2019s tired clown act.         \n\nRodriguez, who presents himself as a mentor to younger players, has provided a road map for Cano\u2019s free agency. By asking for $310 million over 10 years, and by shopping himself to the  \n, Cano is essentially daring the Yankees to make the same mistake with him as they did with Rodriguez. Cano\u2019s lead agent, Jay Z, has taunted the player\u2019s old agent, Scott Boras, in a song. Jay Z needs a splashy signing to establish credibility with other potential clients.         \n\nCano has earned the right to explore his market value in free agency, which he delayed by two years with his previous contract. But the Yankees should heed the warning signs and get out while they can.         \n\nLosing a superstar is not always as devastating as people fear at the time. Two winters ago, the St. Louis Cardinals watched Albert Pujols leave for a 10-year, $240 million deal with the Los Angeles Angels. They responded by signing Carlos Beltran for two years, giving contract extensions to Yadier Molina and Adam Wainwright, and using their compensatory draft pick on Michael Wacha. Discipline sometimes works.         \n\nThe Yankees are willing to give Cano $23 million or so for each of the next seven years, a $161 million package that is already too generous. That kind of deal has put the Yankees in their present state \u2014 decaying and injury-prone \u2014 and the team needs to break the cycle.         \n\nAn influx of fresh talent from the farm system is the best way to start. The Yankees do not have those players, but that should not make them desperate. Desperate teams make the costliest mistakes.         \n\nCano, 31, has been a model of consistency so far, but his switch of agents last spring, from Boras to Jay Z, makes you question what really matters to him. Brodie Van Wagenen and Creative Arts Agency will handle the contract details, but Cano was not swayed by C.A.A. He was swayed by the affiliation with Jay Z and the promise of becoming a crossover star.         \n\nThe agent switch was newsy enough to get a mention on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d \u2014 and the host mispronounced Cano\u2019s last name. It underscored the reality that while Cano is a very good ballplayer, he is just not part of the national conversation. Even among Yankees fans, Cano has limited drawing power. He was the featured star last year when ticket sales and television ratings fell.         \n\nIf Cano wants to increase his personal brand, he\u2019s going to have to work hard at it. He is Jay Z\u2019s first baseball client, and nobody knows what the whiff of true celebrity will do to Cano\u2019s priorities. Teams might find Boras exasperating as a negotiator, but they appreciate his doggedness at keeping clients focused on the field.         \n\nCano may be productive for most or all of the next seven \u2014 or even 10 \u2014 years. But it is a risky bet, and the Yankees can find shorter-term answers all around them. If they drop out of the bidding for Cano, they can move aggressively in a free-agent class with several appealing options.         \n\nEven as they try to get their payroll below the $189 million luxury-tax threshold, the Yankees are going to spend. With the state of their farm system, they have no other choice, and the Red Sox showed with the players they picked up last winter that the right free agents can augment a strong core and lift a team in the standings.         \n\nThe Yankees have strong interest in catcher Brian McCann and starter Masahiro Tanaka (if he becomes available). They like outfielders Shin-Soo Choo, Jacoby Ellsbury and Beltran, and shortstop/third baseman Jhonny Peralta.         \n\nEarly in the off-season, the Yankees checked in with the Cincinnati Reds about second baseman Brandon Phillips, who has four years left on a six-year, $72.5 million contract. The Reds were not ready to trade him, and the asking price was said to be exorbitant.         \n\nThe Yankees have few of the cheap, major-league-ready players teams covet in trades, but if they offered outfielder Brett Gardner and reliever David Robertson, would Cincinnati bite? Gardner could replace Choo, and Robertson would allow Aroldis Chapman to move to the rotation. It is worth exploring.         \n\nCano, to be sure, is a better player than Phillips or Omar Infante, a free-agent option at second base. Losing Cano would rob the Yankees of their best hitter, but they cannot convince themselves that they need Cano to be competitive.         \n\nThere are no easy fixes for the Yankees, who must replace the 91 starts made by Hiroki Kuroda, Andy Pettitte and Phil Hughes, and the late-relief void left by Mariano Rivera\u2019s retirement. But the Yankees should be savvy enough to spread Cano\u2019s dollars around to multiple free agents, find a bargain or two through shrewd scouting, and contend.         \n\nIf they reset their luxury-tax rate and build back their farm system, the Yankees will be thrilled, in a few years, to have Cano off their budget. It is time, for once, to let another team pay for the inevitable decline of a star.
