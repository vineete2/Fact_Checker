{"headline": "Longing for the Days When the Knicks Electrified a City", "body": "\nBack when the  \n were winning year after year \u2014 they made the playoffs for 14 straight seasons, like clockwork \u2014 it was easy to be a fan.         \n\nThe public address announcer would introduce the team, and Madison Square Garden would tremble with cheers. \u201cPaaat-rick Ewing!\u201d \u201cJohn Staaarks!\u201d \u201cCharles Oakleeey!\u201d You could feel the floor and the seats rumbling.         \n\nIn those days, you could count on the Knicks. Not for championships, because the last time they won one was in 1973. But you counted on them for other things that made them fun to watch: great basketball, close games, fierce rivalries. They were often the tenacious, blue-collar underdogs who didn\u2019t back down, even in the face of Michael Jordan\u2019s superhuman jukes and dunks, and Reggie Miller\u2019s annoyingly unstoppable 3-pointers.         \n\nOnce, the exciting Knicks of old made me jump to my feet so forcefully that I ripped stitches out of my surgically repaired knee. In 1994, when the telecast of Game 5 of the finals between the Knicks and the Rockets was interrupted by O. J. Simpson\u2019s Ford Bronco chase, I sat on the couch frozen and in tears.         \n\nThat\u2019s how much emotion the Knicks once inspired in me, and in the city. It was heart-rending for them to come so close to championships and never win one, but the fans at least got their money\u2019s worth.         \n\nNow look at the Knicks. They have made the playoffs in 4 of the past 12 years. Last year, they won 54 games and reached the second round of the playoffs, kindling hopes that they could be great again, only to be among the N.B.A.\u2019s bottom-feeders this season. Their inconsistency makes it so hard to love them.         \n\nAt Barclays Center on Thursday night, in a game formerly earmarked as one of the hottest tickets of the season, the Knicks beat  \n, 113-83, to break a nine-game losing streak. The victory boosted their record to 4-13. The Nets, also considered a playoff team at the start of the season, fell to 5-14. So much for New York being a basketball town.         \n\nThe matchup could have been a thriller between two equally lousy teams \u2014 hey, even watching 8-year-olds play basketball can be entertaining if the game is tight \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t even close to being that. The Knicks had a 25-point lead after three quarters, enough to douse any electricity in the air.         \n\nSure, Nets fans have it bad. Even though their team has the league\u2019s highest payroll \u2014 the Knicks are No. 2 \u2014 and even after the off-season additions of  \n and Paul Pierce, the Nets are still trying to find their way. Coach Jason Kidd said the team wasn\u2019t having fun.         \n\nAfter Thursday\u2019s game, Garnett didn\u2019t have to tell us that. He bowed his head and let out a huge sigh that echoed through the room as he talked to reporters.         \n\nThe Knicks held their heads high. Coach Mike Woodson said it was \u201clike old times again.\u201d  \n said the team played with more confidence than usual and showed just how good it could be. A day after calling the team \u201ca laughingstock,\u201d he managed a smile.         \n\nOne victory against a weak team doesn\u2019t fix the Knicks\u2019 problems, though. They are still a hapless team that is somehow weaker than the sum of its very talented parts.         \n\nBefore the game,  \n, an analyst for TNT, gave me a quick tutorial on why the Knicks couldn\u2019t match the success they had achieved in the late 1980s, the \u201990s and the early 2000s.         \n\nThis is not Anthony\u2019s team or any other player\u2019s team, Barkley said. He told me these Knicks were not leaders, not the way Ewing was in the days he commanded the team to excellence. And they\u2019re not stick-with-it guys like Starks, Oakley or Anthony Mason, Ewing\u2019s teammates who epitomized the grittiness of New Yorkers.         \n\nThen Barkley smirked and said: \u201cYou want to know what these guys are like? Ha, let me put it this way: Dr. Phil would have his hands full.\u201d         \n\nShould we feel sorry, then, for the poor, dysfunctional Knicks, who have yet to win two consecutive games this season? Or should they feel sorry for us?         \n\nIf the Knicks need a psychologist, as Barkley suggested, their fans do, too. During that 14-year playoff run in which the Knicks were perennial also-rans, free therapy sessions should have come with every season ticket, or at least every one of Charles Smith\u2019s missed layups.         \n\nNow fans have to wonder which Knicks will show up. On Thursday, the Knicks drew us in again. They shot brilliantly \u2014 57.1 percent from the field and 59.3 percent from the 3-point line. While it wasn\u2019t a great accomplishment, given that it happened against the lowly Nets, it still showed resilience and gumption.         \n\nThe fans in the stands cheered the loudest, though, when Knicks center Andrea Bargnani tangled with Garnett in the fourth quarter. The two players ended up on the floor after trying to position themselves for a rebound. Pushing ensued. Benches cleared. Fans throughout the arena rose to their feet, seemingly ready to take part in a brawl after an evening of lackluster competition. Bargnani and Garnett received technical fouls.         \n\nNot long afterward, Bargnani ended his night acting like a tough-guy Knicks player of the past. Thrown out of the game after talking trash to Garnett, he headed off the court with an icy look and the swagger of a Western gunslinger. The crowd roared.         \n\nHe showed that the Knicks could still be feisty. And whether they win or lose, that\u2019s exactly what will keep some fans coming back.
