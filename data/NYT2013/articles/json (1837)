{"headline": "Brooklyn Inquiry Finds Witness Who Says Police Coached Him to Lie", "body": "\nA sweeping investigation into cases handled years ago by a retired Brooklyn homicide detective has turned up a witness to a 1995 murder who says the police coached him into giving false testimony.         \n\nThe witness, Sharron Ivory, gave crucial evidence in one of roughly 40 trial convictions handled by the detective,  \n, that are now being reviewed by the Brooklyn district attorney\u2019s office. The review was  \n that Mr. Scarcella sometimes engaged in questionable tactics, and may have helped frame an innocent man in another case.         \n\nMr. Ivory was interviewed in recent weeks, first by a pair of detectives and then by an assistant district attorney, he said in a telephone interview. He told them he was lying nearly 20 years ago when he said he could identify the man who shot his cousin, a little girl who was struck by a stray bullet in a case that caused considerable public outrage.         \n\nMr. Ivory\u2019s account is just one facet of the broad investigation into Mr. Scarcella\u2019s cases that was announced nearly five months ago by the Brooklyn district attorney,  \n. Going back decades, and covering years\u2019 worth of convictions, it is a highly unusual re-examining of the work of a detective who, at the time, was among the most productive in New York City. And while Mr. Ivory says he was interviewed, lawyers for other defendants, as well as some of those convicted, said the review appeared to be moving in fits and starts.         \n\n\u201cProgress has been very slow,\u201d said Pierre Sussman, a civil rights lawyer who represents four people whose cases were investigated by the detective. \u201cIn the meantime, I have live human beings in maximum-security facilities for crimes they did not commit.\u201d         \n\nLawyers are hopeful that the challenges of time, fading memories and the deaths of many witnesses can be overcome in the wake of  \n in the Democratic primary election last month. (Mr. Hynes had said he would not run in the general election as a Republican, but reversed himself on Thursday.)         \n\nMany people involved in the cases were skeptical of Mr. Hynes\u2019s review efforts, because most of the convictions took place under his watch, and they now believe that the man who beat him, Kenneth P. Thompson, may be more willing to exonerate people if they were convicted on flimsy evidence.         \n\nA spokesman for Mr. Thompson said he would not comment on the Scarcella investigation until he had taken office in January and read the case files.         \n\nThe files will include the case in which Mr. Ivory testified: the 1995 death of his 4-year-old cousin, Shamone Johnson, who skated into a barrage of bullets that was meant for a local gang at the Prospect Plaza housing project in Brooklyn. The investigators who visited Mr. Ivory in the last few weeks wanted to know if he stood by information he gave when he identified a man accused of the shooting. At the time, Mr. Ivory said he recognized a photograph of the suspect.         \n\nNow Mr. Ivory, 40, says that was not true. \u201cI didn\u2019t recognize anyone,\u201d Mr. Ivory told The New York Times in a telephone interview from Eastern Correctional Facility, a prison in Ulster County where he is serving time in an unrelated homicide. \u201cThe cops would say the number out loud and say, \u2018Take a good look at it,\u2019 so I went with it. I thought they knew what they were doing. And I figured if it wasn\u2019t him, he could beat it at trial.\u201d         \n\nMr. Ivory said the prosecutor who visited him in prison several weeks ago casually mentioned that he could face perjury charges if he changed the story he had testified to be true.         \n\nRecords show that it was not Mr. Scarcella who presented the photographs to Mr. Ivory. His role in the case involved obtaining the confession, which the defendant, Sundhe Moses, said he signed only because the detective had become physically abusive. When it came time to testify in court, Mr. Ivory ultimately did not identify Mr. Moses, but the jury, apparently persuaded by the confession, voted to convict.         \n\nMr. Moses was sentenced to 16 years to life for Shamone\u2019s death.         \n\n\u201cI feel bad,\u201d Mr. Ivory said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want somebody to be in jail for something they didn\u2019t do.\u201d         \n\nMr. Hynes would not comment on the investigation, nor would he reveal which cases are being reviewed. But interviews with lawyers and witnesses involved in many of Mr. Scarcella\u2019s cases, and who would presumably be central to any review, have provided a general portrait of the investigation\u2019s current status. While some witnesses say they have indeed been contacted, far more say they have not been.
