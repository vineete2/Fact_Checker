{"headline": "Pan de Muerto Is Bread That Gets Into the Spirit", "body": "\nOver the next few days, space will grow increasingly tight at the  \n in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. The counters are piled high with displays of colorful breads in the shapes of skulls or figures in repose, and customers are coming in droves to buy special pan de muerto, or bread of the dead, some of them 10 loaves at a time.         \n\nFounded 16 years ago by a family from a tiny town in Puebla, this Mexican bakery is always busy, especially in the evenings when people stop in on their way home to pick up pan dulce, or sweet bread, traditionally eaten with coffee or hot chocolate at the end of the day. But the small shop is taking on a far more festive air as owners and customers prepare for D\u00eda de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead, on Saturday.         \n\nThe table where you would normally find the bakery\u2019s fresh sandwich rolls and coffee, for example, has been converted into an elaborate altar known as an ofrenda, or offering, like those in many of its customers\u2019 homes. It is festooned with sugared skulls, flowers and other mementos of the family\u2019s departed, and at the center is pan de muerto.         \n\nThe traditional type is a soft round of sweet, yeast-risen egg bread, similar to challah and topped with two crossed links of dough meant to symbolize crossbones. It is offered up on this holiday to the spirits of the dead, along with their favorite foods such as tamales, mole, tequila and coffee prepared however they liked it, said Evelin Rojas, 30, who helps her parents, Amador and Maria, and four siblings run the shop.         \n\n\u201cFood is the essence of the Day of the Dead,\u201d said Magda Bogin, a New York author who also runs  \n, a cooking school in Tepoztl\u00e1n, Mexico, \u201cbecause it\u2019s by the scent of their favorite foods that the dead are driven back to the living.\u201d         \n\nThe demand for the bread, a staple of a holiday meant to honor the dead, is so high that Guadalupana now asks its customers to order in advance, Ms. Rojas said.         \n\nIn Mexico, there are regional varieties of pan de muerto. Guadalupana also bakes another version typically made in the family\u2019s hometown, Piaxtla, said Miguel Rojas, 27, one of the five siblings. It is a saltier flatbread covered with bright pink sugar loosely shaped into the form of a sleeping woman with crossed arms, as if in a coffin.         \n\nAs the holiday approaches, the pan de muerto at Guadalupana also grows more elaborate, based on special orders or the whims of the bakers.         \n\nWith a few nicks of her baker\u2019s bench scraper, Mrs. Rojas, 53, deftly forms the basic dough into smiling skulls, dolls with braids and frilly dresses, or fluffy rabbits meant to honor children. She will give the dough a kiss of orange blossom water or almond extract, add cinnamon and raisins, paint on whimsical pink sugar swirls, or add a patchwork of tiny crossbones that bake into flowery forms. The seasonal pan de muerto loaves sell for $4 to $7, depending on how fancy they are. The bakery sells smaller pan de muerto loaves year round for $1.         \n\nMrs. Rojas learned her traditional techniques from her husband and his father, who was a well-known baker in Piaxtla. But if his father inherited baking skill, said Miguel Rojas, for his mother it became a passion. \u201cThat\u2019s her craft,\u201d he said. \u201cShe takes it as an art form.\u201d         \n\nIndeed, customers need variation because they have to buy a lot of pan de muerto. By tradition, Mr. Rojas said, you add to your ofrenda on three occasions: once for those who died by accident, once for children and again for adults.         \n\n\u201cI remember my grandma used to have a long table,\u201d Evelin Rojas said, \u201cand I would want to eat everything that was there.\u201d Instead, she recalled, she had to wait until Nov. 2, when families feast with the visiting spirits of their loved ones.         \n\nWhile customers crowd Guadalupana during the holiday, the bakery produces hundreds of small rounds of sweet bread even on a normal day, to sell to markets throughout the city or directly to customers who walk in to pick up their indispensable daily pan dulce. Following tradition, they walk around and select their own breads with tongs, piling them on an aluminum tray.
