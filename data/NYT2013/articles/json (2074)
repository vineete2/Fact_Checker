{"headline": "The Nakeds Next Door", "body": "\nShannon Sessoms has never been so ready for winter. Cold weather brings the promise of several months without awkward sightings of the neighbors whom her family refers to as the Nakeds.         \n\nMs. Sessoms, who lives with her husband and two young children in Harlem, first spotted one of the Nakeds two summers ago while enjoying a glass of wine on her apartment balcony one evening. The balcony overlooks the backyards of several brownstones, and out of the one directly opposite her emerged a 40ish woman with dreadlocks, wearing nothing but a T-shirt.         \n\n\u201cI thought, well, maybe she\u2019s running outside to let the cat or dog in,\u201d Ms. Sessoms, 43, said. \u201cBut then she started gardening, nude.\u201d         \n\nAs in shirt gone, completely naked?         \n\n\u201cCompletely naked,\u201d Ms. Sessoms said.         \n\nShe yelled for her husband to come look. \u201cHe\u2019s like, \u2018I don\u2019t want to see my neighbor naked,\u2019\u00a0\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018No, no, you have to see.\u2019 But by the time he came, she was gone, and he didn\u2019t believe me.\u201d         \n\nCredibility was restored as the sightings increased in frequency and began to involve other family members: the husband taking naked smoking breaks; the couple and their two young children dining alfresco and au natural.         \n\n\u201cThe husband was grilling naked,\u201d Ms. Sessoms said. \u201cThat\u2019s a little dangerous.\u201d         \n\nMs. Sessoms was recalling these events on an unseasonably warm fall afternoon a few weeks ago, on the same balcony that overlooks her neighbors\u2019 yard. It was the kind of day, a reporter pointed out, that a nudist might regard as an invitation for a late-season frolic.         \n\n\u201cWe were really excited about this balcony,\u201d Ms. Sessoms said, looking across at her neighbors\u2019 yard warily. \u201cWe don\u2019t enjoy it as much as we thought we would.\u201d         \n\nIn a city like New York, where residents live in such close proximity, nudity is an often unavoidable part of domestic life. The living room window of one apartment faces the bedroom of another, which has an unobstructed view into the bathroom of a third. Many of the city\u2019s interiors \u2014 especially those of some of the newer glass-sheathed buildings \u2014 afford all the privacy of a gym locker room. (Indeed, in some corridors of the city,  \n, especially near  \n, the nudity on display seems to be part of the attraction.)         \n\nAnd while some people are titillated or disturbed by seeing a neighbor naked, others are driven to distraction, as one man who  \n several years ago claimed to be. Under the heading \u201cPlease stop walking around naked \u2014 25th Street,\u201d he confessed to seeing his young, blond, female neighbor on several occasions, and said that it was killing his work productivity. In his open letter, he pleaded, \u201cWhen you practice booty dancing in your underwear in front of the mirror, then I\u2019m screwed.\u201d         \n\nThe Craigslist poster complained that his neighbor not only danced half-naked, but did so with the lights on and the blinds up, a habit shared by other New Yorkers. Living among 8.3 million people tends to create a sense of anonymity and encourage a laid-back attitude toward baring it all at home. If the guy in the next building sees a flash of skin as you go from the shower to the closet \u2014 or practice booty dancing \u2014 so what?         \n\nIn New York, said  \n and professor of writing at a university in Manhattan, \u201cyou don\u2019t really know the people across the way. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the same in a small town.\u201d         \n\nFrom her office, Ms. Schulman, 52, enjoys a \u201cRear Window\u201d-like view into a mix of prewar apartment buildings and townhouses. Over the years, she said, she has noticed one resident in particular: \u201cMy window looks straight into his bedroom, and he never closes his curtains or shades. He\u2019s reliably naked.\u201d (She asked that her employer go unnamed so as not to embarrass the man.)         \n\nHalf of literary New York has seen this immodest fellow, Ms. Schulman joked, explaining that when visiting writers come to her office, she points him out. \u201cIt\u2019s a really funny icebreaker,\u201d she said.         \n\nIf you haven\u2019t seen someone in the buff, or nearly naked, it\u2019s likely that someone has seen you. Most residents of big apartment buildings are skilled at the half-naked dash to the hall closet and back, or the shirtless plunge into the hallway for the Sunday paper.         \n\n\u201cWe all stumble out in the morning,\u201d Ms. Schulman said of the residents of her Upper West Side building. \u201cIf our neighbor comes out in boxers or a T-shirt, I say, \u2018Oh, we\u2019ve all seen it already.\u2019\u00a0\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/21/garden/the-nakeds-next-door.html", "date": "2013-11-20", "description": "Life in the big city sometimes means having neighbors without inhibitions \u2014 or window shades."}
