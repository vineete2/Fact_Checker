{"headline": "Steamy Wait Before a Walk in a Museum\u2019s Rain", "body": "\nAlexander Guo had been waiting in the baking sun since 6:45 a.m. \u2014 nearly five and a half hours. Finally, ahead of him, people in line took three or four steps forward.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s moving again!\u201d Mr. Guo, a 20-year-old Williams College junior, shouted on Saturday morning. \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle!\u201d         \n\nSince May 12, Mr. Guo and tens of thousands of others \u2014 art lovers, technology buffs and the merely curious \u2014 have trooped to the Museum of Modern Art for a chance to experience \u201cRain Room,\u201d a temporary installation in which water rains down except where sensors detect people, giving visitors the illusion of walking between the drops.         \n\nThe work, by the little-known art collective  \n, received tepid reviews from art critics.  \n, Ken Johnson said, \u201c\u00a0\u2018Rain Room,\u2019 for all its entertaining ingenuity, seems little more than a gimmicky diversion.\u201d But fueled by thousands of photos \u2014 dramatically backlighted, Hollywood-like \u2014 posted on social media, and by the increasing popularity of immersive art, people have been willing to stand for hours in 90-plus-degree weather to snap their own pictures inside.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a New York thing \u2014 FOMO,\u201d said Brianne Chai-Onn, 34, using the acronym for \u201cfear of missing out.\u201d         \n\n\u201cA lot of people have this syndrome,\u201d she said while waiting in line on Saturday. \u201cThat\u2019s why we don\u2019t sit in our apartments.\u201d         \n\nThe average wait on weekdays, according to  \n, has been four to five hours for nonmembers and two to three hours for members, who use a fast-track line. Weekends are worse; a nonmember can expect to wait more than five hours. Some visitors last weekend reported waiting nine hours, longer than a standard work day.         \n\nOn Sunday, the first people in line were admitted at precisely 9:30 a.m., when the museum opened. But the line had been declared full \u2014 and closed \u2014 a half-hour earlier.         \n\nThe wait is partly a result of the artists\u2019 decision to cap the exhibit\u2019s capacity to 10 at a time \u2014 a mob would trigger the sensors into shutting off the rain entirely \u2014 and by the many visitors who ignore the museum\u2019s polite request to limit visits to 10 minutes. So far, roughly 55,000 visitors have passed through \u201cRain Room,\u201d according to the Modern.         \n\nThe lines seem to defy rational explanation, even to those devoting their time to them.         \n\n\u201cThere has to be a reason people are waiting this long,\u201d said Sylvana Fernandez, 24, who lives in Brooklyn, about four hours into her wait.         \n\nLaurie Garrett, 61, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, waited for two hours last Thursday morning \u2014 her third attempt to see the show. MoMA, she said, treated visitors like \u201ccattle in line.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why they didn\u2019t have a reservation system,\u201d said Ms. Garrett, who lives in Brooklyn. \u201cAnd it\u2019s July! There were people who were melting on the sidewalk.\u201d Afterward, she said that though she was impressed by the engineering, she was underwhelmed by the experience.         \n\nBut at least four couples have become engaged surrounded by the rain, according to MoMA. On Monday, Scott Milam, a 27-year-old wedding photographer, brought his girlfriend of 15 months, Molly Caldwell, all the way from Phoenix, to ask her to marry him. Ms. Caldwell \u201chas always been convinced it would rain on her wedding day,\u201d Mr. Milam said afterward. \u201cWhen I saw \u2018Rain Room\u2019 on Instagram, I was blown away and went, \u2018Gosh, I can\u2019t make it rain on her wedding day, but I can on the day I propose to her.\u201d She said yes.         \n\nWith waits expected to lengthen as the July 28 closing date nears, two members of the rAndom International studio, Hannes Koch and Florian Ortkrass, flew to New York from their London base last week to meet with MoMA officials. The artists, wanting to preserve what Mr. Koch called the \u201cmeditative\u201d aspect of the piece, firmly opposed a mandatory time limit; and in the end, MoMA did not make any official changes.         \n\n\u201cThe queue should be part of the work; it should be a social experience,\u201d Mr. Koch said by telephone, but added, \u201cWe have to make it not miserable.\u201d         \n\nTo speed things up, the museum has created a viewing-only line, for people who want just to observe but not to frolic in the rain. The weekend wait: about 40 minutes.         \n\nAnyone exceeding a 10-minute visit gets a \u201ccourtesy tap\u201d on the shoulder, said Dave Bennett, MoMA\u2019s lobby membership manager. But several visitors said they felt hurried through.         \n\n\u201cThe longer people wait, the longer they want to stay,\u201d Mr. Bennett said. \u201cIt\u2019s a vicious cycle.\u201d         \n\nAs if to illustrate his point, Tanya Maldonado-Toomey, 28, of Manhattan, who had waited four hours and was still far from the entrance, declared, \u201cI\u2019m going to be in there an hour.\u201d         \n\nMoMA had an inkling demand would be strong: When \u201cRain Room\u201d made its debut last fall in London, waiting times hit 12 hours. Still, Mr. Koch said: \u201cThat was Great Britain. People like queuing. They have a special relationship with rain.\u201d         \n\nIn London, where \u201cRain Room\u201d was free, the average visit was seven minutes. At MoMA, where admission is $25, some linger for 45 minutes.         \n\nOnce viewed, the exhibition left many people scratching their heads.         \n\nKirsten Thoft, a 48-year-old architect, echoed the comments of many when she said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s art,\u201d to which her husband, Ted Nadeau, 49, a computer scientist, rejoined, \u201cIt\u2019s Facebook-friendly art.\u201d         \n\n\u201cRain Room\u201d is the latest in a string of interactive, crowd-pleasing art exhibitions in New York, including Tatzu Nishi\u2019s \u201c \n\u201d for which the monument in Columbus Circle was enclosed in a temporary apartment;  \n last winter with 42 swings at the Park Avenue Armory; and \n in 2011 at the New Museum, where visitors were encouraged to float naked. At MoMA in 2010, people lined up for hours  \n from across a table.         \n\n\u201cThe phrase \u2018once in a lifetime\u2019 is bandied around in marketing-speak, but in this realm it tends to be true,\u201d said Nicholas Baume, director of the Public Art Fund, which produced \u201cDiscovering Columbus.\u201d \u201cNone of us will ever have that experience again.\u201d         \n\nLast in line on Saturday afternoon were Thea Killeen, 65, and her 16-year-old son, Oliver, who had driven seven hours from their home south of Buffalo.         \n\nThey got into \u201cRain Room\u201d just 15 minutes before the exhibit\u2019s closing time of 5:30.         \n\nOliver reported that once inside, \u201cI got in trouble for doing a headstand.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/18/arts/steamy-wait-before-a-walk-in-a-museums-rain.html", "date": "2013-07-17", "description": "Waits are hours long for \u201cRain Room,\u201d an installation at the Museum of Modern Art that has rain falling all around, but miraculously, not on you."}
