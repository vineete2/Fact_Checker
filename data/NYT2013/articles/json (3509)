{"headline": "Right to Lawyer Can Be Empty Promise for Poor", "body": "\nADEL, Ga. \u2014 Billy Jerome Presley spent 17 months in a Georgia jail because he did not have $2,700 for a child support payment. He had no prior jail record but also no lawyer. In Baltimore last fall, Carl Hymes, 21, was arrested on charges of shining a laser into the eyes of a police officer. Bail was set at $75,000. He had no arrest record but also no lawyer. In West Orange, N.J., last summer, Walter Bloss, 89, was served with an eviction notice from the rent-controlled apartment he had lived in for 43 years after a dispute with his landlord. He had gone to court without a lawyer.         \n\nFifty years ago, on March 18, 1963, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in  \n that those accused of a crime have a constitutional right to a lawyer whether or not they can afford one. But as legal officials observe the anniversary of what is widely considered one of the most significant judicial declarations of equality under law, many say that the promise inherent in the Gideon ruling remains unfulfilled because so many legal needs still go unmet.         \n\nCivil matters \u2014 including legal issues like home  \n, job loss, spousal abuse and parental custody \u2014 were not covered by the decision. Today, many states and counties do not offer lawyers to the poor in major civil disputes, and in some criminal ones as well. Those states that do are finding that more people than ever are qualifying for such help, making it impossible to keep up with the need. The result is that even at a time when many law school graduates are without work, many Americans are without lawyers.         \n\nThe  \n, the Congressionally financed organization that provides lawyers to the poor in civil matters, says there are more than 60 million Americans \u2014 35 percent more than in 2005 \u2014 who qualify for its services. But it calculates that 80 percent of the legal needs of the poor go unmet. In state after state, according to a survey of trial judges, more people are now representing themselves in court and they are failing to present necessary evidence, committing procedural errors and poorly examining witnesses, all while new lawyers remain unemployed.         \n\n\u201cSome of our most essential rights \u2014 those involving our families, our homes, our livelihoods \u2014 are the least protected,\u201d Chief Justice Wallace B. Jefferson of the Texas Supreme Court, said in a recent speech at New York University. He noted that a family of four earning $30,000 annually does not qualify for legal aid in many states.         \n\nJames J. Sandman, president of the Legal Services Corporation, said, \u201cMost Americans don\u2019t realize that you can have your home taken away, your children taken away and you can be a victim of domestic violence but you have no constitutional right to a lawyer to protect you.\u201d         \n\nAccording to the World Justice Project, a nonprofit group promoting the rule of law that got its start through the American Bar Association, the United States  \n in access to and affordability of civil legal services.         \n\n\u201cIn most countries, equality before the law means equality between those of high and low income,\u201d remarked Earl Johnson Jr., a retired justice of the California Court of Appeal. \u201cIn this country for some reason we are concerned more with individuals versus government.\u201d         \n\nWith law school graduates hurting for work, it may appear that there is a glut of lawyers. But many experts say that is a misunderstanding.         \n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have an excess of lawyers,\u201d said Martin Guggenheim, a law professor at New York University. \u201cWhat we have is a miserable fit. In many areas like family and housing law, there is simply no private bar to go to. You couldn\u2019t find a lawyer to help you even if you had the money because there isn\u2019t a dime to be made in those cases.\u201d         \n\nEven in situations where an individual is up against a state prosecutor and jail may result, not every jurisdiction provides lawyers to the defendants. In Georgia, those charged with failing to pay child support face a prosecutor and jail but are not supplied with a lawyer.         \n\nMr. Presley lost his job in the recession and fell way behind on support payments for his four children. In 2011, he was jailed after a court proceeding without a lawyer in which he said he could not pay what he owed. He was brought back to court, shackled, every month or two. Each time, he said he still could not pay. Each time, he was sent back.         \n\nA year later, he contacted a public defender who handles only criminal cases but who sent his case to the  \n. Atteeyah Hollie, a lawyer there, got him released that same day, helped him find work and set up a payment plan.
