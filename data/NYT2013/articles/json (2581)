{"headline": "Nudged to the Produce Aisle by a Look in the Mirror", "body": "\nEL PASO \u2014 Samuel Pulido walked into his local grocery store on a sweltering day, greeted by cool air and the fantasy-world ambience of the modern supermarket.         \n\nSoft music drifted. Neon-bright colors turned his head this way and that. \u201cWOW!!!\u201d gasped the posters hanging from entranceway racks, heralding the sugary drinks, wavy chips and Berry Colossal Crunch being thrust his way.         \n\nThen he looked down at his grocery cart and felt quite a different tug. Inside the front of the buggy, hooked onto its red steel frame, was a mirror. It stretched nearly a foot across, and as Mr. Pulido gripped the cart a little more tightly, it filled with the reflection of his startled face.         \n\nThe sight was meant to be a splash of reality in the otherwise anonymous la-la land of food shopping, a reminder of who he was, how he looked and perhaps what he had come in for. And if the spell cast by the store wasn\u2019t entirely broken, it seemed to have lost at least some of its grip.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking at myself, and thinking, \u2018O.K., now what?\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said.         \n\nThe mirror is part of an effort to get Americans to change their eating habits, by two social scientists outmaneuvering the processed-food giants on their own turf, using their own tricks: the distracting little nudges and cues that confront a supermarket shopper at every turn. The researchers, like many government agencies and healthy-food advocates these days, are out to increase consumption of fruits and vegetables. But instead of preaching about diabetes or slapping taxes on junk food, they gently prod shoppers \u2014 so gently, in fact, that it\u2019s hard to believe the results.         \n\nIn one early test at a store in Virginia, grocery carts carried a strip of yellow duct tape that divided the baskets neatly in half; a flier instructed shoppers to put their fruits and vegetables in the front half of the cart. Average produce sales per customer jumped to $8.85 from $3.99.         \n\nHere in El Paso a few months ago, the researchers focused on the floor, laying down large plastic mats bearing huge green arrows that pointed shoppers to the produce aisle. The outcome surprised no one more than the grocer.         \n\n\u201cIn retail, the customer tends to go to the right,\u201d said Tim Taylor, the produce director for Lowe\u2019s, Pay and Save, a regional grocery chain that let the scientists in to experiment with their arrows and mirrors. \u201cBut I watched when the arrows were down, pointing left, and that\u2019s where people went: left, 9 out of 10.\u201d         \n\nWith those same guinea-pig customers, the scientists tinkered again with the cart, creating a glossy placard that hung inside the baskets like the mirrors. In English and Spanish, the signs told shoppers how much produce the average customer was buying (five items a visit), and which fruits and vegetables were the biggest sellers (bananas, limes and avocados) \u2014 information that, in scientific parlance, conveys social norms, or acceptable behavior.         \n\nBy the second week, produce sales had jumped 10 percent, with a whopping 91 percent rise for those participating in the government nutrition program called Women, Infants and Children. Lowe\u2019s was so excited that it now plans to put the placards in every cart at its 22 stores in El Paso and nearby Las Cruces, N.M., and perhaps later at all 146 of its stores.         \n\nFor grocers, there is one potential glitch: While produce sales climbed in these trials, the store\u2019s total sales remained mostly the same. That meant shoppers spent less on nonproduce items. \u201cThey\u2019re moving preference from one side of the store to the other, which is wonderful,\u201d said Michael Kelly, a senior program officer at the  \n, which is financing the research. \u201cPeople still stay on their budgets, get more nutrients and less of the processed \u2014 well, let\u2019s just say bad \u2014 stuff.\u201d         \n\nBut the owners of Lowe\u2019s are smiling, too, because along with the meat counter, the produce aisle is one of the most profitable parts of a grocery store, with large volumes and higher-than-average markups from the wholesale cost. So even if sales of frozen pizza and potato chips dip, the grocer\u2019s net profit will rise if zucchini gains.         \n\nFinding a profit motive in social policy fits well with the politically conservative views of the researchers engaged in this supermarket manipulation: two Republican-leaning academics at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces.         \n\nOne, Collin R. Payne, a 38-year-old associate professor, graduated from Brigham Young University and then worked on a string of groundbreaking studies at the  \n at Cornell University that affirmed a concept known as  \n: the notion that if you put food on a smaller plate, you\u2019ll probably eat less.
