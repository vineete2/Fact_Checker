{"headline": "Pulled Back From Suicide, a Gay Grandmother Asks How to Treat Those Who Shun Her", "body": "\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n It was hard for me not to feel the irony of reading your deeply affecting e-mail while still basking in the euphoria of  \n. The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and Proposition 8 were dispatched, and jubilant gay couples are now marrying every day in the Golden State. On so many levels, the gay rights movement is succeeding \u2014 but your situation reminds us all that there is still much work to be done. Especially in our generation, too many individuals are still closeted and fighting to come out \u2014 or like you are paying a terrible price for having done so.         \n\nSo first, let me congratulate you for what you\u2019ve done thus far and tell you how glad I am that fate intervened in your suicide plans. As one of the many empathetic  \n wrote (having read your question): \u201cYou\u2019ve faced down the demons, and that takes courage.\u201d Indeed, and your question prompted many others to tell their midlife coming-out stories, nearly all with a similar refrain: \u201cI know exactly how difficult it was for you.\u201d \u201cYou are a strong and brave person, and should be proud of yourself. I am.\u201d         \n\nStill others, like you, shared the fact that they had also tried to commit suicide. One woman who came out at 45 wrote me: \u201cI tried suicide three times and thank God I was a failure at it. I\u2019m now in a committed relationship of 15 years and my kids and grandkids love my spouse.\u201d For those of our generation, coming out seemed so unthinkable that many of us \u2014 and I count myself among the group \u2014 considered taking our own lives rather than face our identities. Back in the day it was called \u201cthe love that dare not speak its name\u201d for good reasons.         \n\nBut what to do about your neighbors and friends? I suggest first that you consider whether a different denomination might be a better fit for you. (Alas, I think it would be impossible to find a different Southern Baptist congregation that doesn\u2019t follow the  \n, which states: \u201cHomosexuality is not a \u2018valid alternative lifestyle.'\u201d)         \n\nMany Christian churches today have inclusive and loving policies of acceptance for all L.G.B.T. people. The Rev. Lisa Fischbeck, vicar of  \n, an Episcopal Church in Chapel Hill, N.C., said, \"There are resources online such as  \n and  \n that list churches and faith communities that welcome and affirm L.G.B.T. folks. Fortunately, that list is growing.\u201d         \n\nBut even a change in your churchgoing will not solve the problem, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have to face your neighbors and former friends in many other everyday situations. I would give them some (more) time to adjust to this news about your sexuality. From your e-mail it sounds as though you came out only a scant seven months ago.         \n\nStill, I can imagine that there\u2019s a part of you that wants to respond as this Facebook poster: \u201cTell them to go to hell.\u201d But then he added: \u201cBut I know that is the wrong reaction. Don\u2019t lower yourself to their level of bigotry and hatred.\u201d Indeed, I advise you to walk with your head high \u2014 literally and figuratively. Greet your fellow congregants and neighbors politely, make eye contact, nod, smile and say, \u201cHello.\u201d As hurt breeds hurt, respect begets respect. Not every time. Not right away. But eventually.         \n\nOf all the Facebook responses to your question, I was most moved by these sage words from Brandon Lineback, a 17-year-old high school student:         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nFinally, as you continue to be open about your sexuality, it will help to remember that not all of your old friends will come along with you. That\u2019s O.K. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find a new community that respects and accepts you for who you are \u2014 and not who you once pretended to be.         \n\n \n         \n\nResources: For those of faith I highly recommend the video documentary \n\u201d; the story of Bishop Gene Robinson,  \n; and the short film called  \n.\u201d As for suicide prevention, the  \n (800-273-TALK) is open 24/7;  \n (Services & Advocacy for Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual & Transgender Elders) provides social services (212-741-2247); and \n is nationally known for crisis intervention and suicide prevention to L.G.B.T. youths (866-488-7386).         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/09/booming/pulled-back-from-suicide-a-gay-grandmother-asks-how-to-treat-those-who-shun-her.html", "date": "2013-07-09", "description": "No longer able to deny her identity, a lesbian who  planned to die rather than tell her family the truth, wonders how to respond to those who won\u2019t accept her coming out."}
