{"headline": "The Frills Are Few. The Fees Are Not.", "body": "\nThere is a joke in the airline business that you could make money giving out free beer and charging a fee for the bathroom.         \n\nNo one has tried that \u2014 at least not yet \u2014 but one small airline has led the way in the United States when it comes to passenger fees: Spirit Airlines, the no-frills carrier that prides itself for offering the lowest fares, then charging passengers for everything else.         \n\nNeed an agent to print out a boarding pass at the airport? That\u2019s $10. Want some water? That\u2019s $3. Rolling a bag on board? The tag costs $35 from home and $50 at the airport. In all, there are about 70 fees enumerated in dizzying detail on  \nfor customers to navigate.         \n\nTo the millions of travelers flying on vacation this summer, the fees can be infuriating, but Spirit makes no apologies. In an age of consolidation in the airline industry, Spirit, with about 1 percent of the nation\u2019s passenger traffic, has managed to succeed by going it alone, scraping for every dollar and scrimping on every cost.         \n\n\u201cSpirit does everything it can to make or save a buck,\u201d said Henry Harteveldt, a travel analyst with Hudson Crossing. \u201cTo its credit, Spirit doesn\u2019t promise passengers that they\u2019ll be coddled. Its customer service standards are terrible, and the airline\u2019s actions have shown it doesn\u2019t care about being liked or respected.\u201d         \n\nThe driving force behind that strategy is Spirit\u2019s chief executive, Ben Baldanza, 51, an industry veteran who arrived at Spirit eight years ago with no experience at a no-frills airline. Along with an obsessive attention to keeping costs low, Mr. Baldanza argues that the cornucopia of fees allows the airline to keep its fares lower than rivals. The airline, known for its tasteless ads (during the presidential election, one ad talked of Spirit having \u201cbinders full of sales. Women will love them!\u201d) is modeled after Ryanair, which charges low fares for flights throughout Europe with a minimalist approach to customer service.         \n\n\u201cI cringe a little when people say I don\u2019t care about customers,\u201d said Mr. Baldanza, who brims with missionary zeal. \u201cWe care about the thing that customers tell us they care the most about, and that\u2019s offering the lowest possible fares. The customers who fly Spirit absolutely understand the trade-off.\u201d         \n\nOn a recent day at La Guardia Airport, passengers seemed to be taking the fees in stride. Two students forgot about the fee that Spirit charges for carry-on bags. That did little to reduce their enthusiasm to fly to Las Vegas despite the early loss. Kevin Reed, a photographer flying to Myrtle Beach, S.C., paid an extra $10 on top of a $35 checked-bag fee because he failed to do so when he bought his ticket.         \n\n\u201cThey got me there,\u201d he said, shrugging. \u201cBut I\u2019m still saving $400 over flying with Delta.\u201d         \n\nNot every customer has the same reaction, though. Spirit is routinely rated as the nation\u2019s worst airline because some travelers deem the fees unfair. The Transportation Department receives far more complaints about Spirit than other carriers, with 6 to 8 complaints per 100,000 passengers compared with the industry average of 1.4. And Spirit\u2019s on-time record is similarly abysmal, at 68.8 percent compared with 80 percent for the industry average. The best airlines are in the mid-90s.         \n\nCritics point out that the inflation of air travel fees makes it increasingly difficult to compare the cost of travel between airlines.         \n\n\u201cThe fee-for-everything technique allows airfares to be advertised as much lower than the overall cost,\u201d said Paul Hudson, the president of FlyersRights.org, a consumer group.         \n\nMr. Baldanza acknowledged that the process can be tricky. \u201cYou can\u2019t sleepwalk through the process,\u201d he said.         \n\nBut the model has allowed Spirit to offer cheap tickets. Since 2008, Spirit\u2019s airfare has dropped by 20 percent, averaging $75 in 2012 compared with $94 in 2008. The difference often jumps out at a customer searching for flights. On Friday, Spirit was offering a nonstop flight from Oakland, Calif., to Portland, Ore., in mid-July for $156; the same trip was $296 on Delta.         \n\nBecause of its growing list of fees, however, nonticket revenues grew to $51.39 in 2012, from $18.61 in 2008. As a result, while fares fell, Spirit\u2019s total revenue per passenger grew by 12 percent from 2008 to 2012, reaching $126.50. Fees now account for 41 percent of Spirit\u2019s revenues, an industry record.
