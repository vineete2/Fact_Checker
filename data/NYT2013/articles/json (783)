{"headline": "Player Ratings: U.S. (1) vs. Panama (0)", "body": "\nFor the first time since 2007, the United States national team is the Gold Cup Champion, its title secured with a 1-0 victory over an upstart Panama team on Sunday at Soldier Field in Chicago.         \n\nIt was not the most pleasant game to watch, as Panama had a clear defensive game plan from the start. While most Concacaf teams tend to bunker against the United States, Panama is clearly better at it than most. In that sense it made Sunday\u2019s final a better-played game than it appeared, because it was a true tactical battle that the U.S. handled well. Patience was the key for the Americans, and the players never appeared frustrated as the scoreless deadlock dragged on deep into the second half.         \n\nIn the first half, the United States dominated possession but had nothing to show for it. In the second half it increased the pace even more and began to create dangerous opportunities. The U.S. team always looked confident it was going to score.         \n\nBy winning the tournament, the U.S. team will have the opportunity to face the winner of the 2015 Gold Cup (provided it is not the United States) for an opportunity to play in the 2017 Confederations Cup. In addition, several players made strong cases to be part Jurgen Klinsmann\u2019s plans as it builds towards next year\u2019s World Cup in Brazil. Mix Diskerud had never played for the U.S. team except for friendlies, but his play during the tournament proved that he should be considered. Kyle Beckerman is not an offensive threat but his defense always gave the Americans an edge.         \n\nThe most noteworthy takeaway from the Gold Cup, however, was that Landon Donovan is truly an exceptional player. After Donovan\u2019s four-month sabbatical, Klinsmann was reluctant to bring him back into the U.S. camp. Donovan, however, dominated the tournament and showed that he is back to his old self. When Donovan is inserted into the top United States roster along with Clint Demspey, Michael Bradley, Jozy Altidore, Jermaine Jones and Fabian Johnson, Klinsmann will have the building blocks for a dangerous team.         \n\nThe ratings (on a scale of 1, diabolical; to 10, world class):         \n\n \n For his first shutout of the Gold Cup, Rimando did not have much to do. While he faced little danger, he commanded his area well and his distribution was solid.  \n         \n\n \n Gradually improving throughout the Gold Cup, Parkhurst had a strong final. His passing was crisp and he was aggressive when he attacked. Defensively, he was rock on the right side. With Steve Cherundolo coming off surgery and Timothy Chandler not fully integrated into the U.S. team, it would not be a surprise if Parkhurst became the first-choice right back for the time being.  \n         \n\n \n It was a very good tournament for Goodson, who developed a nice chemistry with Matt Besler in central defense. Goodson was dominant in the air and solid with his passing out of the back, and he won his battles against Blas Perez, which limited Panama\u2019s attack. He greatly improved his stock.  \n         \n\n \n It has been a great year for Besler, who earned his first cap in January but over the past seven months has risen to the top of the depth chart in central defense. Against Panama he showed why he will probably be a starter with the top team. His passing was stellar and he helped in the possession game.  \n         \n\n \n Beasley is still adjusting to the left back position, and while it will never be his best spot, he showed that he can play there in important games. Against Panama he was dangerous moving up the left side, and his speed allowed him to recover defensively.  \n         \n\n \n Defensively it was another impressive performance from Beckerman, the Real Salt Lake central midfielder. Panama was never dangerous up the middle of the field, and that was his primary job. Offensively he is not flashy, but he remains a very good defensive midfielder. He won a lot of balls and helped the team in its overwhelming possession edge.  \n         \n\n \n It was a short outing for Holden, who left the game early in the first half with what was described as a sprained knee. He has been battling injuries for most of the past two years and will be further evaluated this week.  \n [UPDATED, Monday, 7 p.m.: U.S. Soccer and Holden\u2019s club, Bolton Wanderers, announced that Holden has a torn A.C.L. in his right knee.]         \n\n \n When the United States was struggling to break down Panama\u2019s well-organized defense, Bedoya was the most energetic attacker and the only player able to get himself into dangerous positions until the game opened up in the second half. His pass to Donovan in the 69th minute produced the game\u2019s only goal, even if Brek Shea was the player who touched it into the net.  \n         \n\n \n After sitting out the semifinal, Corona returned to the starting lineup, though it was not his best game. He struggled to create opportunities against Panama\u2019s tough defense, and while he had some nice moments, he was not a major factor in the attack. It is obvious that playing on the wings is not his best position.  \n         \n\n \n For Panama to have any chance at winning the game, it had to neutralize Donovan. For the most part that plan worked, as Donovan had his worst game of the tournament. He missed a point-blank header in the second half and even whiffed on Bedoya\u2019s cross on the goal. Despite that, he improved as the game progressed and was the focal point of the offense in the second half. He wasn\u2019t the best player in the game, but he was the best player throughout the tournament.  \n         \n\n \n After two strong performances in the knock-out stages, Johnson had a poor game against Panama. He was rarely dangerous and missed an absolute sitter in the 84th minute. He helped maintain possession in his hold-up play but his frequent back-passing seemed to deflate the attack.  \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n Coming on for Holden in the 23rd minute, Diskerud was initially rusty, but he had a strong second half as the American attack came to life. He was terrific on both sides of the ball and was instrumental as the offense improved after halftime. A question mark before the tournament, Diskerud improved his chances at being part of the team for the remaining World Cup qualifiers.  \n         \n\n \n Subbing into the game in the 68th minute, Shea made an instant impact by scoring a goal less than a minute after stepping onto the field. Yes, it was not the most difficult goal, and the rolling ball probably would have gone in even if he hadn\u2019t touched it, but his overall appearance was good. He added much-needed width to the U.S. attack and sent in a series of good crosses. After a poor outing in the group stages against Cuba, Shea rebounded nicely.  \n         \nMNT vs. Panama: Brek Shea Goal - July 28, 2013 \n\n \n The Los Angeles Galaxy defender replaced Bedoya in the 89th minute.  \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n While Klinsmann was suspended for the final, he did a good job preparing the team for the final. The U.S. was patient in breaking down a well-organized Panamanian defense, and the defense made few mistakes. The team did not lose focus despite losing Holden early in the game with a knee injury, and the Shea substitution paid off immediately \u2014 as did most of the U.S team\u2019s substitutes throughout the tournament. The United States had the most talented players in the tournament, but the coaching staff made sure it had the best team.  \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/29/sports/soccer/player-ratings-us-1-vs-panama-o.html", "date": "2013-07-28", "description": "Players ratings from the United States national team\u2019s 1-0 victory over Panama in the Concacaf Gold Cup final in Chicago."}
