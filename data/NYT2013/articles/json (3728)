{"headline": "August Showoffs: Steak and Salsa", "body": "\nI\u2019ll admit that most of the grilled meals I make are about as basic as it gets. Throw some combination of protein and vegetables on the grill, set the table, open \u00a0the wine and call it a meal. Sauce is just a drizzle of olive oil and maybe some herbs from the deck. It keeps the kitchen cool, feeds the family and is about as easy as can be.         \n\nThis chile-rubbed flank steak with tomatillo-pineapple salsa is a dish of a higher order. It\u2019s a company-friendly endeavor that takes a little more forethought (marinating!), some minor effort with the coals (indirect heat!) and a bit of concentration. You have to keep track of how all the different ingredients are cooking and pull them off the grill one by one before they burn. Not that any of the techniques are challenging or time consuming. It\u2019s just not the kind of thing you can do on automatic pilot.         \n\nBut the payoff is great. The steak comes out charred and spicy on the outside, seasoned with oregano, orange juice and chile powder, and juicy on the inside. And the chunky tomatillo salsa studded with bits of sweet, caramelized pineapple walks the line between condiment and side dish, nicely setting off the brawny meat. It\u2019s a festive, colorful meal for a cookout.         \n\nIf you can organize yourself the day before, let the meat marinate a full 24 hours so it can really absorb the complex, earthy heat of New Mexico chile powder. (Seek out the good stuff here; its intense, almost fruity flavor makes a difference.)         \n\nFlank steak is a muscly cut that toughens up if you overcook it. Rare or medium-rare is optimal, and medium is as far as you should push it. If you like well-done meat, choose a more tender cut like rib-eye. Always slice flank steak across the grain; it breaks up the muscle fibers and makes it easier to chew.         \n\nIf you serve this dish with warmed tortillas, sliced avocado and maybe quick-pickled onions or jalape\u00f1os, it can pass as steak tacos. Or serve it with a potato and corn salad as a more traditional entree.         \n\nBut whatever you do, serve it to friends. It\u2019s a dish made for summertime sharing.
