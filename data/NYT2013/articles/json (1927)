Bush \u2014 is an unreliable partner.         \n\nThis American administration is \u201cmisreading and miscalculating the effects\u201d of its deeds in a Europe that is less ready than it once was to heed the United States, said Annette Heuser, executive director of the Bertelsmann Foundation, a research organization in Washington.         \n\nEarly on Friday, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France emerged from a meeting of European leaders to call for talks with the United States on new rules for their intelligence relationship. A statement from the European leaders said a \u201clack of trust\u201d could undermine trans-Atlantic intelligence cooperation.         \n\nEarlier in the week the European Parliament had acted to suspend an agreement with the United States that allows it to track the finances of terrorist groups, citing suspicions that the United States authorities were tapping European citizens\u2019 personal financial data.         \n\nThe disclosures contained in the documents leaked by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden have crystallized a growing sense in Europe that post-Sept. 11 America has lost some of the values of privacy and accountability that have been the source of the world\u2019s admiration for its version of democracy.         \n\nSo fierce was the anger in Berlin over suspicions that American intelligence had tapped into Ms. Merkel\u2019s cellphone that Elmar Brok of Germany, the chairman of the European Parliament\u2019s foreign affairs committee and a pillar of trans-Atlantic exchanges since 1984, spoke Friday of America\u2019s security establishment as a creepy \u201cstate within a state.\u201d         \n\nSince Sept. 11, 2001, he said, \u201cthe balance between freedom and security has been lost.\u201d         \n\nTo be sure, the United States and Europe are like a bickering couple that will never break up. For all the sharp words, they cannot even begin to contemplate an actual divorce. Many of the European complaints about the United States also seem directed mainly at a domestic audience, and may not result in concrete changes to a relationship that has weathered many storms.         \n\nBut the United States under Mr. Obama had lost a considerable amount of European patience and good will even before the latest round of disclosures from the leaked N.S.A. documents.         \n\nFirst came the diplomatic shambles over Syria, where, in late summer, the United States seemed poised for military action after the killing of hundreds by chemical weapons. France keenly backed America, as did Britain\u2019s prime minister, David Cameron. But Mr. Cameron unexpectedly failed to get support from his Parliament, Mr. Obama wavered, Russia stepped in with a last-minute diplomatic solution that left Germany and other nations diplomatically bruised, and France was left hanging out to dry.         \n\nBarely had the trans-Atlantic partners gotten over that discomfort than the divisive partisan politics of Washington precipitated a government shutdown and brought the United States \u2014 and thus Europe and the world \u2014 to the brink of default and economic turmoil.         \n\nThis week, two American ambassadors, Charles H. Rivkin in France and John B. Emerson in Germany, were summoned to the Foreign Ministries in Paris and Berlin for a dressing down by two of America\u2019s closest friends. The depressing spectacle reversed the traditional roles played by Europe and America, certainly for Germany. France is a proud nuclear power, and while relations have been exceptionally warm in recent years, it is strongly independent and a frequent critic, particularly of American culture.         \n\nStill, it was unusual to hear the foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, lecture so sternly.
