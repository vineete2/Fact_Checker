{"headline": "Lower Health Insurance Premiums to Come at Cost of Fewer Choices", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Federal officials often say that health insurance will cost consumers less than expected under President Obama\u2019s  \n. But they rarely mention one big reason: many insurers are significantly limiting the choices of doctors and hospitals available to consumers.         \n\nFrom California to Illinois to New Hampshire, and in many states in between, insurers are driving down premiums by restricting the number of providers who will treat patients in their new health plans.         \n\nWhen insurance marketplaces open on Oct. 1, most of those shopping for coverage will be low- and moderate-income people for whom price is paramount. To hold down costs, insurers say, they have created smaller networks of doctors and hospitals than are typically found in commercial insurance. And those health care providers will, in many cases, be paid less than what they have been receiving from commercial insurers.         \n\nSome consumer advocates and health care providers are increasingly concerned. Decades of experience with  \n, the program for low-income people, show that having an insurance card does not guarantee access to specialists or other providers.         \n\nConsumers should be prepared for \u201cmuch tighter, narrower networks\u201d of doctors and hospitals, said Adam M. Linker, a health policy analyst at the North Carolina Justice Center, a statewide advocacy group.         \n\n\u201cThat can be positive for consumers if it holds down premiums and drives people to higher-quality providers,\u201d Mr. Linker said. \u201cBut there is also a risk because, under some health plans, consumers can end up with astronomical costs if they go to providers outside the network.\u201d         \n\nInsurers say that with a smaller array of doctors and hospitals, they can offer lower-cost policies and have more control over the quality of health care providers. They also say that having insurance with a limited network of providers is better than having no coverage at all.         \n\nCigna illustrates the strategy of many insurers. It intends to participate next year in the insurance marketplaces, or exchanges, in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Tennessee and Texas.         \n\n\u201cThe networks will be narrower than the networks typically offered to large groups of employees in the commercial market,\u201d said Joseph Mondy, a spokesman for Cigna.         \n\nThe current concerns echo some of the criticism that sank the Clinton administration\u2019s plan for universal coverage in 1993-94. Republicans said the Clinton proposals threatened to limit patients\u2019 options, their access to care and their choice of doctors.         \n\nAt the same time, House Republicans are continuing to attack the new health law and are threatening to hold up a spending bill unless money is taken away from the health care program.         \n\nIn a new study, the Health Research Institute of PricewaterhouseCoopers, the consulting company, says that \u201cinsurers passed over major medical centers\u201d when selecting providers in California, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky and Tennessee, among other states.         \n\n\u201cDoing so enables health plans to offer lower premiums,\u201d the study said. \u201cBut the use of narrow networks may also lead to higher out-of-pocket expenses, especially if a patient has a complex medical problem that\u2019s being treated at a hospital that has been excluded from their health plan.\u201d         \n\nIn California, the statewide Blue Shield plan has developed a network specifically for consumers shopping in the insurance exchange.         \n\nJuan Carlos Davila, an executive vice president of Blue Shield of California, said the network for its exchange plans had 30,000 doctors, or 53 percent of the 57,000 doctors in its broadest commercial network, and 235 hospitals, or 78 percent of the 302 hospitals in its broadest network.         \n\nMr. Davila said the new network did not include the five medical centers of the University of California or the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center near Beverly Hills.         \n\n\u201cWe expect to have the broadest and deepest network of any plan in California,\u201d Mr. Davila said. \u201cBut not many folks who are uninsured or near the poverty line live in wealthy communities like Beverly Hills.\u201d         \n\nDaniel R. Hawkins Jr., a senior vice president of the National Association of Community Health Centers, which represents 9,000 clinics around the country, said: \u201cWe serve the very population that will gain coverage \u2014 low-income, working class uninsured people. But insurers have shown little interest in including us in their provider networks.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/23/health/lower-health-insurance-premiums-to-come-at-cost-of-fewer-choices.html", "date": "2013-09-22", "description": "With insurance marketplaces set to open next month under the new health care law, consumers may find that insurers have put big limits on their choices."}
