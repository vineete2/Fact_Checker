{"headline": "In the Zone With Peyton Manning", "body": "\nENGLEWOOD, Colo. \u2014 As the  \n ran out the clock in their win over the San Diego Chargers last weekend, football fans gasped as  \n, the undisputed face of the N.F.L., got up limping after being tackled around his legs.         \n\nThe injury turned out to be only an aggravation of an earlier ankle sprain, and Manning said he would play Sunday in a prime-time showdown with the undefeated Kansas City Chiefs, who are atop the A.F.C. West, one game ahead of the Broncos.         \n\nYet the concern over Manning\u2019s health was a reminder of how valuable he is \u2014 not just to the Broncos, but the entire league. On pace to win a record fifth Most Valuable Player award and perhaps lead the Broncos to the  \n for the first time in 15 years, Manning is a proven leader on the field, and a winner off the field, too.         \n\nHe is the country\u2019s best-known football player, the successor to Dan Marino, John Elway and Brett Favre, who all held center stage during their prime. Sponsors crave his aw-shucks grin and seemingly spotless personal life, and a raft of endorsement deals, including for Buick,  \n and Papa John\u2019s, keeps him in the spotlight on nongame days.         \n\nManning, 37, has one of the most lucrative contracts and the best-selling jersey, as well as a sense of humor that has made him a natural on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d From a family of star quarterbacks, he has an unmatched football pedigree.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all part of the legend of Peyton,\u201d said Fred Gaudelli, the producer of NBC\u2019s \u201cSunday Night Football,\u201d which will feature the Broncos four times this season. \u201cIt\u2019s about him playing the position like no one else. Any team that has Peyton Manning makes a good team for \u2018Sunday Night Football.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nManning\u2019s record-setting season and commercial appeal is a welcome distraction for the N.F.L., which is grappling with a host of hits to its image, including Aaron Hernandez\u2019s, the former Patriots tight end, being charged with murder; allegations that the offensive lineman Jonathan Martin was bullied by Richie Incognito and other teammates on the Miami Dolphins; and a heated debate about whether the Washington Redskins should change their name.         \n\nOn top of those problems, player safety remains a concern, even after the N.F.L. agreed in August to pay $765 million to settle a lawsuit brought by thousands of retirees who accused the league of burying evidence that repeated head hits could lead to long-term brain damage. This month, the Hall of Fame running back Tony Dorsett and two other former stars were found to have signs of a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated head trauma.         \n\nThis has not been a good year for star quarterbacks, either. Aaron Rodgers, Jay Cutler and Michael Vick have been sidelined by injuries, and backup quarterbacks are also being knocked out.         \n\n\u201cI never like to see a quarterback get injured, I will say that,\u201d Manning said Wednesday at the Broncos\u2019 training facility while he sidestepped questions about the severity of his injury. \u201cI think quarterbacks are a kind of unique fraternity, and you kind of pull for one another \u2014 maybe not when you\u2019re playing against them that day.\u201d         \n\nFor now, Manning\u2019s ankle sprain appears to be little more than a speed bump in an otherwise standout season. After returning from several neck injuries, he guided the Broncos to a 13-3 season last year, and the team is off to an even faster start this season. Manning reached 400 touchdowns in record time and passed Marino on the career passing list. One reason the Broncos are the top scoring team, averaging 41.2 points a game, is that Manning\u2019s work ethic has rubbed off on others.         \n\n\u201cEvery day he comes in, and you can tell he loves practicing and everything about what this is,\u201d said Adam Gase, the team\u2019s offensive coordinator. \u201cHe\u2019s been in the league a long time, but he acts like it\u2019s his second year.\u201d         \n\nOffense sells tickets, even more so when Manning is driving it. The Broncos have sold out their home games for 44 consecutive seasons, so Manning cannot help fill more seats. But tickets for resale average more than $300, according to  \n, which tracks such data. Prices of tickets to Broncos road games are also steep.         \n\nJoe Ellis, the team\u2019s president, said that Manning, along with Coach John Fox, who is away from the team after heart surgery, and Elway, who is the vice president for football operations, have revitalized fans, sponsors and network executives, who now race to show Broncos games.         \n\n\u201cFans know they\u2019re watching one of the greatest,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cPeyton takes it all seriously, but he doesn\u2019t take himself seriously. We\u2019re at peak levels of popularity.\u201d         \n\nSince Labor Day, the Broncos have been on six of the 11 most-watched television programs, and the team will be featured on six prime-time broadcasts, the maximum allowed for a team. Manning\u2019s attention to detail extends to his readiness to speak to visiting reporters and television announcers, sometimes sending team spokesmen back to them with extra details he forgot to include in the interviews.
