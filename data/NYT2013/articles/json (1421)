{"headline": "E.U. Officials Agree to a Deal Rescuing Cyprus", "body": "\nBRUSSELS \u2014 Struggling into the early-morning hours to avoid a collapse of Cyprus\u2019s banking system,  \n leaders on Monday agreed on a bailout package intended to keep Cyprus in the euro zone and rebuild its devastated economy.         \n\nThe deal, struck after hours of meetings here, was approved by the finance ministers from the euro zone, the 17 countries that use the common currency. It would drastically prune the size of Cyprus\u2019s oversize banking sector, bloated by billions of dollars from Russia and elsewhere in the former Soviet Union.         \n\nThe deal would scrap the highly controversial idea of a tax on bank deposits, although it would still require forced losses for depositors and bondholders.         \n\n\u201cWe have a deal,\u201d President Nicos Anastasiades was quoted as saying by Greek media. \u201cIt is in the interests of the Cypriot people and the European Union.\u201d         \n\nThe head of the finance ministers, Jeroen Dijsselbloem of the Netherlands, said the agreement could \u201cbe implemented without delay\u201d without a new vote by the Cypriot Parliament, which had rejected a deal last week. Lawmakers on Friday passed legislation that set the framework for the new action, he said.         \n\n\u201cThis has indeed been an arduous week for Cyprus,\u201d he said.         \n\nHe did not have exact timing for when Cyprus\u2019s banks, which have been closed for more than a week, would reopen. Cyprus would receive the first payment of the bailout package worth 10 billion euros, or $13 billion, in early May.         \n\nUnder the agreement, Laiki Bank, one of Cyprus\u2019s largest, would be wound down and senior bondholders would take losses.         \n\nDepositors in the bank with accounts holding more than 100,000 euros would also be heavily penalized but the exact amount of those losses would need to be determined.         \n\nThe plan to resolve Laiki Bank should allow the Bank of Cyprus, the country\u2019s largest lender, to survive. But the Bank of Cyprus will take on some of Laiki\u2019s liabilities in the form of emergency liquidity, which has been drip-fed to Laiki by the European Central Bank. That short-term financing, which the E.C.B. had threatened to cut off on Monday, is expected to continue.         \n\nDepositors in the Bank of Cyprus are likely to face forced losses rather than any form of tax. That plan, which set off outrage last week in Cyprus and as far away as Moscow, has now been dropped entirely.         \n\nMr. Dijsselbloem said he was \u201cconvinced this is a much better deal\u201d because under the revised agreement, the heaviest losses \u201cwill be concentrated where the problems are, in the large banks.\u201d         \n\nThese provisions should help reverse what, in recent days, has been Cyprus\u2019s steady retreat into a surreal pre-modern economy dominated by cash.         \n\nRetailers, gas stations and supermarkets, gripped by uncertainty over whether Cyprus would really secure a 10 billion-euro financial lifeline, have increasingly refused to take credit cards and checks.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been cash-only here for three days,\u201d said Ali Wissom, the manager at Il Forno di Jenny\u2019s restaurant off Cyprus\u2019s main square in Nicosia. \u201cThe banks have closed, we don\u2019t really know if they will reopen, and all of our suppliers are demanding cash \u2014 even the beer company.\u201d         \n\nWith major banks in Cyprus shut for more than week, a trip to the cash machine became a daily ritual for anyone in need of money. The initial limit on withdrawals was 400 euros. It then fell to 260. As of Sunday night, it slipped to a meager 100 euros.         \n\nAt the Centrum Hotel, Georgia Xenophontes, 23, an employee in the front office, said she drained her bank account at a cash machine last week \u2014 just in time to avoid being hit with the latest withdrawal limit.         \n\n\u201cThis is affecting everything in our lives,\u201d she said. \u201cEven though you don\u2019t want to count on money, you need it. But we don\u2019t have stability.\u201d         \n\nIn Brussels, the day was filled with confusion and rancor. Reports filtered out of heated confrontations between Mr. Anastasiades and European Union negotiators, and especially with the  \n, which Mr. Anastasiades has accused of trying to push Cyprus up against a wall.         \n\nMr. Anastasiades told officials including Christine Lagarde, head of the monetary fund, that accepting harsh terms might force him to step down.
