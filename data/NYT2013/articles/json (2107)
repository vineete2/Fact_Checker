{"headline": "Embracing, Not Resenting, Their Differences", "body": "\n \n         \n\nKen and Sheema Karp met as college students in New York City and married in 1971. Sheema, the daughter of a Pakistani diplomat, teaches at the United Nations International School, and Ken is a professional photographer with his own business. The couple lives in Lower Manhattan. They have two adult children. A condensed and edited version of our conversation follows.         \n\n \n         \n\nKen: We met at a party at a friend\u2019s house while we were at Hunter College. I was there with a male friend and she was there with her friend. The guy I was with was actually hoping to take Sheema out, but I convinced him that because he lived in Brooklyn and so did the other girl, that he should go out with her instead.         \n\nSheema: One was a very charming Irish guy, and one a very glum-looking fellow in all black, Ken. I was dressed in a sari, so neither of us really looked like who we were.         \n\nAfter that, we bumped in to each other at school. I was in western clothes and he didn\u2019t recognize me. But a week later I got a call from him. I asked how he got my number and he said, \u201cI got it from my friend because we both live in Manhattan, so we should be the ones dating.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nKen: We went to Ratner\u2019s. It was cold and I remember we took a bagel with us in her bag to eat later and when we pulled it out the thing had frozen.         \n\nSheema: I was very awkward because I hadn\u2019t really been on a date before; I came from a family where we didn\u2019t date much. He was charming and pleasant. He put his arm out to escort me across the street and I thought, \u201cI like this guy.\u201d         \n\nKen: We dated for two years and Sheema wanted a commitment. I was pretty young I had no idea what I was getting into, but I didn\u2019t want to lose her.         \n\n \n         \n\nKen: I\u2019m Jewish and she was born in Pakistan and comes from a traditional family, but they were pretty open to me. There were discouragements because of our youth; We were both 21. My family didn\u2019t come to the wedding and there was a 10-year period after that where I didn\u2019t see them at all.         \n\nSheema: His family was convinced I was an Arab and I said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m Pakistani.\u201d They could not reconcile what they saw as religious and cultural differences. Everyone thought we were too young. We didn\u2019t have real jobs. We were both working in a day care center. But all those people who told us not to get married are divorced now.         \n\nKen: It was mainly my father. He had racist notions that I was going to be making my life harder. My mother just thought we didn\u2019t know what we were doing.         \n\n \n         \n\nKen: I did not have a close relationship with my family. If I had been a practicing Jew, I may not have made this decision. It never came between us. I was just hurt.         \n\n \n         \n\nKen: My parents didn\u2019t come. We had a very small wedding in Sheema\u2019s family\u2019s apartment. It was very Pakistani. There were probably two dozen people.         \n\nSheema: We had a black Muslim imam from Brooklyn. My father was the Pakistani ambassador to Sudan and Madagascar, and one of his friends from the State Department was our witness. I wore my mother\u2019s wedding gown and Ken wore the jacket my father got engaged in.         \n\n \n         \n\nKen: After about 15 years, when we were about to have a child, Sheema said that we should try to contact them. I was pretty resistant to the idea \u2014 I was still quite resentful at their reaction to our marriage. But she persevered until I gave in, and I\u2019m really glad I did.         \n\nSheema: Now my children can say they knew their grandma and grandpa.         \n\n \n         \n\nSheema: It seems na\u00efve now, but it was clear to me as a young girl that I was going to get married and that I would be supported. I never thought of my work as anything I would do for money. But then we were living in a dinky apartment on Kings Highway in Brooklyn and didn\u2019t have much money. Ken has a traditional approach and took the idea of supporting me seriously, but it was overwhelming for him and I realized that this was real life and I would have to work. I got a job at a publishing company.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/22/booming/embracing-not-resenting-their-differences.html", "date": "2013-11-22", "description": "Sheema Karp was born in Pakistan, and her husband, Ken, was raised Jewish.
