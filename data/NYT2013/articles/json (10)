{"headline": "Can Forgiveness Play a Role in Criminal Justice?", "body": "\nAt 2:15 in the afternoon on March 28, 2010, Conor McBride, a tall, sandy-haired 19-year-old wearing jeans, a T-shirt and New Balance sneakers, walked into the Tallahassee Police Department and approached the desk in the main lobby. Gina Maddox, the officer on duty, noticed that he looked upset and asked him how she could help. \u201cYou need to arrest me,\u201d McBride answered. \u201cI just shot my fianc\u00e9e in the head.\u201d When Maddox, taken aback, didn\u2019t respond right away, McBride added, \u201cThis is not a joke.\u201d         \n\nMaddox called Lt. Jim Montgomery, the watch commander, to her desk and told him what she had just heard. He asked McBride to sit in his office, where the young man began to weep.         \n\nAbout an hour earlier, at his parents\u2019 house, McBride shot Ann Margaret Grosmaire, his girlfriend of three years. Ann was a tall 19-year-old with long blond hair and, like McBride, a student at Tallahassee Community College. The couple had been fighting for 38 hours in person, by text message and over the phone. They fought about the mundane things that many couples might fight about, but instead of resolving their differences or shaking them off, they kept it up for two nights and two mornings, culminating in the moment that McBride shot Grosmaire, who was on her knees, in the face. Her last words were, \u201cNo, don\u2019t!\u201d         \n\nFriends couldn\u2019t believe the news. Grosmaire was known as the empathetic listener of her group, the one in whom others would confide their problems, though she didn\u2019t often reveal her own. McBride had been selected for a youth-leadership program through the Tallahassee Chamber of Commerce and was a top student at Leon High School, where he and Grosmaire met. He had never been in any serious trouble. Rod Durham, who taught Conor and Ann in theater classes and was close to both, told me that when he saw \u201cConor shot Ann\u201d in a text message, \u201cI was like: \u2018What? Is there another Conor and Ann?\u2019 \u201d         \n\nAt the police station, Conor gave Montgomery the key to his parents\u2019 house. He had left Ann, certain he had killed her, but she was still alive, though unresponsive, when the county sheriff\u2019s deputies and police arrived.         \n\n \n Andy Grosmaire, Ann\u2019s father, stood beside his daughter\u2019s bed in the intensive-care unit of Tallahassee Memorial Hospital. The room was silent except for the rhythmic whoosh of the ventilator keeping her alive. Ann had some brainstem function, the doctors said, and although her parents, who are practicing Catholics, held out hope, it was clear to Andy that unless God did \u201cwondrous things,\u201d Ann would not survive her injuries. Ann\u2019s mother, Kate, had gone home to try to get some sleep, so Andy was alone in the room, praying fervently over his daughter, \u201cjust listening,\u201d he says, \u201cfor that first word that may come out.\u201d         \n\nAnn\u2019s face was covered in bandages, and she was intubated and unconscious, but Andy felt her say, \u201cForgive him.\u201d His response was immediate. \u201cNo,\u201d he said out loud. \u201cNo way. It\u2019s impossible.\u201d But Andy kept hearing his daughter\u2019s voice: \u201cForgive him. Forgive him.\u201d         \n\nAnn, the last of the Grosmaires\u2019 three children, was still living at home, and Conor had become almost a part of their family. He lived at their house for several months when he wasn\u2019t getting along with his own parents, and Andy, a financial regulator for the State of Florida, called in a favor from a friend to get Conor a job. When the police told Kate her daughter had been shot and taken to the hospital, her immediate reaction was to ask if Conor was with her, hoping he could comfort her daughter. The Grosmaires fully expected him to be the father of their grandchildren. Still, when Andy heard his daughter\u2019s instruction, he told her, \u201cYou\u2019re asking too much.\u201d         \n\nConor\u2019s parents were in Panama City, a hundred miles away, on a vacation with their 16-year-old daughter, when they got the call from the Tallahassee Police. Michael McBride, a database administrator for the Florida Department of Transportation, and Julie, his wife, who teaches art in elementary school, knew one of them would need to stay with Conor\u2019s sister, Katy, who is developmentally disabled. It was decided that Michael would drive to Tallahassee alone.
