{"headline": "Can Emotional Intelligence Be Taught?", "body": "\nOne day last spring, James Wade sat cross-legged on the carpet and called his kindergarten class to order. Lanky and soft-spoken, Wade has a gentle charisma well suited to his role as a teacher of small children: steady, rather than exuberant. When a child performs a requested task, like closing the door after recess, he will often acknowledge the moment by murmuring, \u201cThank you, sweet pea,\u201d in a mild Texas drawl.         \n\nAs the children formed a circle, Wade asked the 5-year-olds to think about \u201canything happening at home, or at school, that\u2019s a problem, that you want to share.\u201d He repeated his invitation twice, in a lulling voice, until a small, round-faced boy in a white shirt and blue cardigan raised his hand. Blinking back tears, he whispered, \u201cMy mom does not like me.\u201d The problem, he said, was that he played too much on his mother\u2019s iPhone. \u201cShe screams me out every day,\u201d he added, sounding wretched.         \n\nWade let that sink in, then turned to the class and asked, \u201cHave any of your mommies or daddies ever yelled at you?\u201d When half the children raised their hands, Wade nodded encouragingly. \u201cThen maybe we can help.\u201d Turning to a tiny girl in a pink T-shirt, he asked what she felt like when she was yelled at.         \n\n\u201cSad,\u201d the girl said, looking down.         \n\n\u201cAnd what did you do? What words did you use?\u201d         \n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Mommy, I don\u2019t like to hear you scream at me.\u2019 \u201d         \n\nWade nodded slowly, then looked around the room. \u201cWhat do you think? Does that sound like a good thing to say?\u201d When the kids nodded vigorously, Wade clapped his hands once. \u201cO.K., let\u2019s practice. Play like I\u2019m your mommy.\u201d Scooting into the center of the circle, he gave the boy, Reedhom, a small toy bear to stand in for the iPhone, then began to berate him in a ridiculous booming voice. \u201cLalalala!\u201d Wade hollered, looming overhead in a goofy parody of parental frustration. \u201cWhy are you doing that, Reedhom? Reedhom, why?\u201d In the circle, the other kids rocked back and forth in delight. One or two impulsively begin to crawl in Reedhom\u2019s direction, as if joining a game.         \n\nStill slightly teary, Reedhom began to giggle. Abruptly, Wade held up a finger. \u201cNow, we talked about this. What can Reedhom do?\u201d Recollecting himself, Reedhom sat up straight. \u201cMommy, I don\u2019t like it when you scream at me,\u201d he announced firmly.         \n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Wade said. \u201cAnd maybe your mommy will say: \u2018I\u2019m sorry, Reedhom. I had to go somewhere in a hurry, and I got a little mad. I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 \u201d         \n\nReedhom solemnly accepted the apology \u2014 then beamed as he shook Wade\u2019s hand.         \nJamal McBride, 8. \n\n \n \u2014 used schoolwide at Garfield Elementary, in Oakland, Calif. \u2014 is part of a strategy known as social-emotional learning, which is based on the idea that emotional skills are crucial to academic performance.         \n\n\u201cSomething we now know, from doing dozens of studies, is that emotions can either enhance or hinder your ability to learn,\u201d Marc Brackett, a senior research scientist in psychology at Yale University, told a crowd of educators at a conference last June. \u201cThey affect our attention and our memory. If you\u2019re very anxious about something, or agitated, how well can you focus on what\u2019s being taught?\u201d         \n\nOnce a small corner of education theory, S.E.L. has gained traction in recent years, driven in part by concerns over school violence, bullying and teen suicide. But while prevention programs tend to focus on a single problem, the goal of social-emotional learning is grander: to instill a deep psychological intelligence that will help children regulate their emotions.         \n\nFor children, Brackett notes, school is an emotional caldron: a constant stream of academic and social challenges that can generate feelings ranging from loneliness to euphoria. Educators and parents have long assumed that a child\u2019s ability to cope with such stresses is either innate \u2014 a matter of temperament \u2014 or else acquired \u201calong the way,\u201d in the rough and tumble of ordinary interaction. But in practice, Brackett says, many children never develop those crucial skills. \u201cIt\u2019s like saying that a child doesn\u2019t need to study English because she talks with her parents at home,\u201d Brackett told me last spring. \u201cEmotional skills are the same. A teacher might say, \u2018Calm down!\u2019 \u2014 but how exactly do you calm down when you\u2019re feeling anxious? Where do you learn the skills to manage those feelings?\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/magazine/can-emotional-intelligence-be-taught.html", "date": "2013-09-11", "description": "If everybody knows that test scores and grades aren\u2019t the keys to success, how do we teach, and measure, the things that are?"}
