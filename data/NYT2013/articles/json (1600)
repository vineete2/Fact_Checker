{"headline": "Confessions of an Art Conservator\u2019s Sidekick", "body": "\nOut in Malibu, the billionaire\u2019s gardener has nicked a bronze with his weed whacker. In Echo Park, the Lady of the Lake is missing her benediction hand. Somewhere in Pasadena, a stone female nude has mysteriously sprouted pubic hair, accomplished with what appears to be hide glue and combings from an auburn Irish setter. Who knows how long it was there? No matter. A few brush strokes with warm distilled water, and she is returned to immodesty once more.         \n\nAll in a day\u2019s work for a Los Angeles sculpture conservator and her sidekick C.T. That\u2019s me, \u201cconservation technician\u201d \u2014 a fanciful title, which basically means you clean up nicely, take very exacting direction and have good-enough hands to keep from shaking when in intimate contact with priceless objects.         \n\nAnd I do mean intimate. No one gets to lay hands on untouchable cultural icons (more on this later) the way we do. A buzz at the gates ushers us into the city\u2019s great mansions; museum guards unhook their velvet ropes as we trundle in our equipment. They recoil in horror as I fire up a howling blowtorch to lay a coat of wax on the twining bodies of a Rodin kiss.         \n\nIt\u2019s mainly damage control and maintenance; cracks and dings and dust, but it\u2019s always different. The work can be grindingly dull \u2014 scraping bird guano with a bamboo cooking skewer \u2014 or as stressful as rebuilding a vase of iridescent Roman glass with tweezers and a microscope.         \n\nBut there\u2019s real magic, too. It\u2019s undeniably cool to perfectly rebuild a stone garden figure that showed up at the studio as a bag of fist-size shards. And there\u2019s nothing like gluing a leg back on a ninth-century Tang-dynasty horse to make you feel located in history.         \n\nBut there may be a dark side to keeping this close company with art, and lately, it has been causing me some concern.         \n\nIt started a couple of months ago. I was vacuuming an Yves Klein, and under my magnifying glasses, its chalky blue surface began to vibrate with a shimmering light. I felt my eyes shift into high definition; my heart was racing. I had been struck by blue lightning, shattered and aglow.         \n\nAnd then, only a short time ago, I was buffing a female bronze, almost 12 feet high. We were outside in the sunlight, the cotton cloth gliding back and forth across the warm expanse of her shoulder. As I moved to the arch of her back, my stroke turned to a caress. For a moment I thought I saw her turn, her dark eyes upon me as I stumbled from the ladder and fell beneath her shadow on the lawn.         \n\nEventually I made the diagnosis. I was suffering from Stendhal syndrome, described following the author\u2019s experience of being surrounded by fine art during a trip to Florence in 1817: \u201cI was seized with a fierce palpitation of the heart,\u201d Stendhal wrote, \u201cand I walked in constant fear of falling to the ground.\u201d         \n\nBeing around dangerous beauty is dangerous work, and perhaps a sudden pang of infatuation for a well-turned Aphrodite is just an occupational hazard for C.T.\u2019s of a certain age. That\u2019s O.K. Art is discreet.         \n\nStill, laying hands on such objects has taught me three things about art I didn\u2019t know before. The first is practical. Sitting quietly on a table in the studio, a Toltec god is staring at me. Life is temporary, but this piece of stone can speak across the time and space of centuries. Art is the only survivor.         \n\nSecond, in the right time and place, great art can deliver great solace. I was scrubbing away on a priceless object one day when I felt a tingle, and looked up.         \n\nAn Art Nouveau lamp hung on the ceiling, three cranes flying in formation below an interlocking panel of frosted glass. The vision was so formal and wild, alive and full of hope that I felt my eyes grow heavy; I was starting to sweat. Stendhal again. Face it, only a fool could fail to feel the desire, the spirit inside such beauty.         \n\nThe last is a lesson for all who keep company with treasured objects. When a vase falls from the mantel, most people\u2019s first impulse is to dispose of the shattered relic, throw it out, begone the tainted thing, the broken dream.         \n\nStop. Don\u2019t do it. Get a broom and dustpan. Pull out your tiny brush. Save every piece, every jagged shard. Do not lose a sliver. I have witnessed the miracles. I have seen them happen under my own hand.         \n\nEverything is not perfect. Everything can be fixed.
