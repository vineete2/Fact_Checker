{"headline": "As F.B.I. Pursued Snowden, an E-Mail Service Stood Firm", "body": "\nDALLAS \u2014 One day last May, Ladar Levison returned home to find an  \n agent\u2019s business card on his Dallas doorstep. So began a four-month tangle with law enforcement officials that would end with Mr. Levison\u2019s shutting the business he had spent a decade building and becoming an unlikely hero of privacy advocates in their escalating battle with the government over Internet security.         \n\nProsecutors, it turned out, were pursuing a notable user of Lavabit, Mr. Levison\u2019s secure e-mail service: Edward J. Snowden, the former  \n contractor who leaked classified documents that have put the intelligence agency under sharp scrutiny. Mr. Levison was willing to allow investigators with a court order to tap Mr. Snowden\u2019s e-mail account; he had complied with similar narrowly targeted requests involving other customers about two dozen times.         \n\nBut they wanted more, he said: the passwords, encryption keys and computer code that would essentially allow the government untrammeled access to the protected messages of all his customers. That, he said, was too much.         \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to bug an entire city to bug one guy\u2019s phone calls,\u201d Mr. Levison, 32, said in a recent interview. \u201cIn my case, they wanted to break open the entire box just to get to one connection.\u201d         \n\nOn Aug. 8, Mr. Levison closed Lavabit rather than, in his view, betray his promise of secure e-mail to his customers. The move, which he explained in a letter on his Web site, drew fervent support from civil libertarians but was seen by prosecutors as an act of defiance that fell just short of a crime.         \n\nThe full story of what happened to Mr. Levison since May has not previously been told, in part because he was subject to a court\u2019s gag order. But on Wednesday, a federal judge unsealed documents in the case, allowing the tech entrepreneur to speak candidly for the first time about his experiences. He had been summoned to testify to a grand jury in Virginia; forbidden to discuss his case; held in contempt of court and fined $10,000 for handing over his private encryption keys on paper and not in digital form; and, finally, threatened with arrest for saying too much when he shuttered his business.         \n\nSpokesmen for the Justice Department and the F.B.I. said they had no comment beyond what was in the documents.         \n\nMr. Levison\u2019s battle to preserve his customers\u2019 privacy comes at a time when Mr. Snowden\u2019s disclosures have ignited a national debate about the proper limits of surveillance and government intrusion into American Internet companies that promise users that their digital communications are secure.         \n\nMuch of the attention has been focused on Internet giants like Microsoft and Google. Lavabit, with just two employees and perhaps 40,000 regular users, was a midget by comparison, but its size and Mr. Levison\u2019s personal pledge of security made it attractive to tech-savvy users like Mr. Snowden.         \n\nWhile Mr. Levison\u2019s struggles have been with the F.B.I., hovering in the background is the N.S.A., which has worked secretly for years to undermine or bypass encrypted services like Lavabit so that their electronic message scrambling cannot obstruct the agency\u2019s spying. Earlier in September,  \n wrote about the N.S.A.\u2019s campaign to weaken encryption. Mr. Levison\u2019s case shows how law enforcement officials can use legal tools to pry open messages, no matter how well protected.         \n\nMr. Levison said he set up Lavabit to make it impossible for outsiders, whether governments or hackers, to spy on users\u2019 communications. He followed the government\u2019s own secure coding guidelines, based on the N.S.A.\u2019s technical guidance, and engineered his systems so as not to log user communications. That way, even if he received a subpoena for a user\u2019s communications, he would not be able to gain access to them. For added measure, he gave customers the option to pay extra to encrypt their e-mail and passwords.         \n\nMr. Levison, who studied politics and computer science at Southern Methodist University, started Lavabit in April 2004, the same month Google rolled out Gmail. To pay his bills, he worked as a Web consultant, helping develop Web sites for major brands like Dr Pepper, Nokia and Adidas. But by 2010, the e-mail service had attracted enough paying customers to allow Mr. Levison to turn to Lavabit full time.         \n\nOn occasion, he was asked to comply with government requests for specific e-mail accounts, including that of a child pornography suspect in Maryland this year. Mr. Levison said he had no qualms about cooperating with such demands, but the latest request was far broader, apparently to allow investigators to track Mr. Snowden\u2019s whereabouts and associates. When Mr. Levison called the F.B.I. agent who had left the business card, the agent seemed interested in learning how Lavabit worked and what tools would be necessary to eavesdrop on an encrypted e-mail account.
