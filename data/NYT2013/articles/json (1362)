{"headline": "North Korea Declares 1953 War Truce Nullified", "body": "\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014  \n declared the 1953 Korean War armistice nullified on Monday, following through on a longstanding threat that it renewed last week amid rising tensions with South Korea.         \n\nThe move comes as the United States and South Korea are in the midst of two months of joint military drills, which started on March 1, and on Monday they began another planned joint exercise that involved bringing 2,500 troops from the United States. Stirring up a sense of crisis among its impoverished people, North Korea was also staging an unusually vigorous military drill.         \n\nHowever, there were no signs of hostility along the border. South Korean officials said they were increasing their vigilance amid fears that North Korea might use the United States-South Korean drills and a fresh round of United Nations sanctions as an excuse to create an armed skirmish.         \n\n\u201cWe must deal strongly with a North Korean provocation,\u201d the South\u2019s new president,  \n, said during her first cabinet meeting on Monday. She called for the protection of people living on a border island that was attacked by North Korean artillery in 2010 and of South Koreans working in a joint industrial park in the North Korean border city of Gaesong.         \n\nBut she also said her two-week-old government would work to build \u201ctrust\u201d with North Korea.         \n\nDuring the cabinet meeting, Ms. Park criticized senior military officers for golfing last weekend amid tensions with the North. Her office is investigating news reports that a military golf course here was crowded with senior officers, including generals.         \n\nKim Min-seok, spokesman of the Defense Ministry, admitted that some officers played golf at the weekend. But he added that none served in sensitive commanding posts.         \n\nIn Washington, the Treasury Department  \n and the State Department  \n of the North Korean government. Tom Donilon, President Obama\u2019s national security adviser, called the steps part of an effort to \u201cwork with allies and partners to tighten national and international sanctions to impede North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs.\u201d         \n\nThe exchange of bellicose language between the Koreas has recently intensified, recalling the level of tension after the North Korean artillery barrage in 2010, which left four South Koreans dead. After the United Nations imposed the new sanctions as a penalty for the North\u2019s third nuclear test, on Feb. 12, the North said it would nullify the armistice and might pre-emptively attack Washington and Seoul with nuclear weapons. South Korea responded that if there were such attacks the North Korean government would be \u201cerased from the Earth.\u201d         \n\nOn Monday, the North\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency said the armistice had been nullified. The North followed through on another threat as well, cutting off a Red Cross hot line.         \n\nHowever, the two continued to operate channels of communication to allow hundreds of South Koreans to commute to the Gaesong industrial complex, one of the last remaining symbols of inter-Korean cooperation.         \n\nNorth Korea had often threatened to nullify the armistice, especially when the United States and South Korea were conducting drills.         \n\nThe United States and South Korea started two months of regular drills, called  \n, on March 1. They involve 10,000 Americans, many brought in from bases outside South Korea. The additional drills that began Monday, named Key Resolve, involve 10,000 South Koreans and 3,000 Americans, along with more sophisticated American aircraft and warships. \u201cThe aggressive Key Resolve exercise by the United States and its puppet war maniacs is a clear declaration of war against our republic,\" \u00a0said the North\u2019s Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, the agency in charge of relations with South Korea.         \n\nIn a visit Monday to a coastal artillery unit that faced Baeknyeongdo, South Korea\u2019s northernmost island, North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, called the disputed waters around the island \u201cthe most volatile tinderbox\" on the Korean border and ordered the soldiers to \u201cdeliver a merciless retaliatory strike\" at any enemy intrusion, North Korea\u2019s news agency reported.
