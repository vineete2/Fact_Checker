First, they are identifying senators who might be willing to change their votes and support a background check system with fewer loopholes.         \n\nSecond, they are looking to build a national campaign that would better harness overwhelming public support for universal background checks \u2014 which many national polls put at near 90 percent approval \u2014 to pressure lawmakers.         \n\nSenators Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, and Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, have been talking in recent days about how they could persuade more senators to support their bill to expand background checks for gun buyers, which drew backing from only four Republicans last week.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to work it hard,\u201d Mr. Manchin said Thursday, adding that he was looking at tweaking the language of his bill in a way that he believed would satisfy senators who, for example, felt that background checks on person-to-person gun sales would be too onerous for people who live in rural areas far from a sporting goods store.         \n\nThose concerns were an issue for Alaska\u2019s senators, Lisa Murkowski, a Republican, and Mark Begich, a Democrat.         \n\nMeanwhile, a separate gun measure, an anti-trafficking bill, is the subject of talks between Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, and two Republican senators who voted no on the background check bill. The Republicans, Senators Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, are discussing ways they might support the bill, which would criminalize the shipping or transfer of guns to someone who is barred from possessing a firearm.         \n\nWhile the bill on its own falls short of what the families of victims of mass shootings have been pushing Congress to enact \u2014 and is therefore less controversial \u2014 some Democrats believe it could be a good starting point to build a broader bipartisan compromise.         \n\n\u201cI think trafficking can be the base of the bill, the rock on which everything else stands,\u201d Ms. Gillibrand said. \u201cI also think it\u2019s complementary to background checks because, let\u2019s be honest, criminals aren\u2019t going to buy a gun and go through a background check. So if you really want to go after criminals, you have to have to do both.\u201d         \n\nMs. Ayotte said Thursday that she would continue talking with Ms. Gillibrand and was confident that some areas of agreement, on areas like expanding mental health care, could be reached.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot we have agreement on in terms of enforcing our current system,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I certainly think we should look for the common elements, including the mental health piece, which I support as well, and try to move as much of that as possible forward.\u201d         \n\nMs. Ayotte \u2014 the only one out of 22 senators on the East Coast north of Virginia who voted against strengthening background checks \u2014 has been the target lately of some of the most furious lobbying by gun control proponents, who have inundated local newspapers with letters to the editor denouncing her vote, run radio ads saying she \u201cignored the will of the people\u201d and swamped her office with phone calls. On Thursday, two receptionists placed one call after another on hold as they politely listened to callers vent and replied, \u201cThank you for your message.\u201d         \n\nNext week when Congress is in recess, gun control groups coordinating with the Obama committee Organizing for Action will be fanning out across the country in dozens of demonstrations at the offices of senators who voted down the background check bill.         \n\nAs talks moved ahead on Capitol Hill, the White House was pressing on with its own efforts. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. summoned a group of gun control proponents to his office on Thursday \u2014 including representatives from Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s Mayors Against Illegal Guns, Gabrielle Giffords\u2019s Americans for Responsible Solutions and the Brady Campaign to End Gun Violence \u2014 and reassured them that the issue had become his highest priority.         \n\nThe vice president recalled the long struggle to enact the Brady Bill, which established a five-day waiting period to buy a gun. And he told them gun control would become his new campaign to end the Iraq war, according to two participants in the meeting, comparing it to the issue he devoted much of his energy to during President Obama\u2019s first term. The pressure campaign is evidently already starting to take its toll, the vice president added, because several senators have confided to him that they are feeling the backlash from constituents.         \n\nThose senators, he added, told him that they needed to be assured there was adequate support for expanded gun control to pass because they did not want to take such a great political risk on something that was doomed to fail. And some of them are already beginning to ask about what tweaks gun control proponents might entertain that could make the bills more palatable, the vice president said.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of really changing their minds for or against this policy,\u201d one of the meeting\u2019s participants said. \u201cIt\u2019s demonstrating that it\u2019s safe to do the right thing and politically unsafe not to.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/26/us/politics/senators-quietly-seek-a-new-path-on-gun-control.html", "date": "2013-04-25", "description": "Talks to revive legislation are quietly under way as a bipartisan group seeks a way to bridge the differences that led to last week\u2019s collapse of a background check bill."}
