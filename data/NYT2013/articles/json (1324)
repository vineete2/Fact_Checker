{"headline": "Tumultuous Days for N.C.A.A.\u2019s President as the Calls for Reform Grow Louder", "body": "\nIn the past month, the  \n and its president, Mark Emmert, have been sued, criticized and ridiculed \u2014 and more than usual. They were embarrassed by admitted mistakes in a high-profile investigation. Their critics, growing louder and in number, included a governor, state senators, lawyers, academics and university presidents.         \n\nA vote of confidence in Emmert from the organization\u2019s executive committee did little to stem the unease that surrounds the N.C.A.A., its enforcement process and Emmert in particular. Even when he took a recent vacation to Hawaii, planned over a year ago, critics cited it as evidence that he was out of touch.         \n\nHis organization is charged with governing college sports. With its dense rulebook and bureaucratic structure, it is no stranger to sharp critiques, or the jokes made at its expense. But many believe that recent events, which prompted the most vociferous complaints since Emmert was named president in April 2010, have led the N.C.A.A. to the brink of a crisis. Now, even those sympathetic with the difficulty inherent in Emmert\u2019s job description are calling for widespread reforms in how college athletics are governed.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t recall a time when there has been less optimism about the N.C.A.A. and how it operates,\u201d said Josephine Potuto, the former chairwoman of the N.C.A.A.\u2019s Committee on Infractions and a law professor at Nebraska. \u201cWhether that\u2019s on merit, or a confluence of events hitting at the same time, the fact is there\u2019s an overwhelming feeling that everything is wrong.\u201d         \n\nIn a telephone interview Wednesday, Emmert, 60, described not the past month but his tenure as \u201cchallenging\u201d under the current, shifting landscape, \u201ca roller coaster of successes and scandals that have crossed over college sports in pretty much every dimension.\u201d Asked whether he ever feared for his job security, Emmert dismissed the question as irrelevant, saying criticism was part of the job.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone could have predicted the number of issues that have surfaced,\u201d he added. \u201cThe frustration is you take two steps forward on the reform agenda and something explodes and you get knocked back. We\u2019re making great progress, but it has been much more tumultuous than any of us expected.\u201d         \n\nThe clamor of criticism grew loudest this month, after Emmert admitted the N.C.A.A. botched its investigation into Miami\u2019s athletic department.         \n\nThe N.C.A.A. dismissed Julie Roe Lach, the vice president for enforcement, after an internal investigation uncovered missteps in procedure that even Emmert labeled \u201cshocking.\u201d         \n\nAs the N.C.A.A. looked into allegations that a booster provided hundreds of thousands in cash to dozens of athletes, investigators violated protocol and acted against the advice of legal counsel. Still, Miami was deemed by the N.C.A.A. to have had a \u201clack of institutional control,\u201d which led the university\u2019s president, Donna Shalala, to fire back that the investigation was \u201cunprofessional and unethical.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nOn Wednesday, Emmert noted that the N.C.A.A. was working to define phrases like \u201clack of institutional control\u201d to separate the behavior of an institution from the behavior of an individual. The new definitions will not go into effect until August, and until then the N.C.A.A. will operate under the established rules.         \n\nWhile the Miami situation boiled, the state of Pennsylvania moved forward with its antitrust lawsuit against the N.C.A.A., filed by Governor Tom Corbett.         \n\nAfter the Jerry Sandusky child sexual abuse scandal, the N.C.A.A. levied unprecedented penalties against Penn State and its football program \u2014 a four-year postseason ban, the loss of 10 scholarships each year, a vacating of all victories since 1997 and a $60 million fine. At issue in the lawsuit is whether the $60 million should be spent in Pennsylvania or nationwide.         \n\nThe N.C.A.A. filed a lawsuit in response, arguing the latter. On Monday, Corbett filed his legal response to the N.C.A.A., which consisted of a 31-page document harshly critical of the organization\u2019s enforcement process.
