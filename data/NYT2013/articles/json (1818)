{"headline": "Small Markets Find Ways to Compete", "body": "\nPITTSBURGH \u2014 From his crouch behind the plate at PNC Park on Tuesday, Russell Martin called for the first pitch of the baseball postseason. On Wednesday, some 130 miles away, the playoffs will continue at Progressive Field, with Nick Swisher taking part.         \n\nMartin and Swisher played last season for the Yankees, who allowed both to leave as free agents as they tried to curb years of lavish spending. Martin went to the  \n and Swisher to the  \n. Their teams, and others from small markets, are part of the playoff field. The Yankees are not.         \n\nAs Commissioner Bud Selig prepares for retirement after next season \u2014 really, he means it this time \u2014 he can add another bullet point to his career r\u00e9sum\u00e9: the 2013 baseball playoffs include more teams from the bottom 10 in payrolls than the top 10.         \n\nAmong the big spenders, only the Los Angeles Dodgers, the  \n and the Detroit Tigers qualified. The Pirates, the Indians, the  \n and the  \n made it from the bottom 10. Competitive balance, a goal for years for a commissioner from Milwaukee, now reigns.         \n\nMarket size matters, but not as much as shrewd management.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy, and the playing field\u2019s not level, but a team like Pittsburgh can never use that as an excuse,\u201d said Bob Nutting, the Pirates\u2019 owner, before the National League wild-card game against the Cincinnati Reds.         \n\n\u201cI think what we have demonstrated, and other people have demonstrated, is that with good decisions, you absolutely can compete in this league. That\u2019s what gives us hope, that\u2019s what drives us forward, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to keep our fans excited. We\u2019re demonstrating it once again in the postseason.\u201d         \n\nThe Rays entered the field on Monday with a 5-2 road victory over the Texas Rangers, reaching the playoffs for the fourth time in the last six years (same as the Yankees). Evan Longoria went 3 for 4 with a home run, and David Price went the distance for the win.         \n\nThe Rays have little to no hope of keeping Price for the long term. But they control Longoria for the next decade, and if the time comes to trade Price, chances are they will make a deal that keeps them competitive. That is how they operate, year after year, despite an outdated ballpark in an inconvenient location that draws few fans.         \n\n\u201cThe whole is greater than the sum of the parts,\u201d Rays outfielder Sam Fuld said last week. \u201cIf you look at our lineup on any given night, you might go, \u2018How is that a playoff team?\u2019 But we make it work. You see Oakland doing the same thing.\u201d         \n\nThe A\u2019s and the Reds have been daring internationally, signing the Cuban free agents Yoenis Cespedes and Aroldis Chapman for contracts the Yankees and others deemed too risky. The Dodgers got into the bidding last year, adding Yasiel Puig for $42 million and Hyun-Jin Ryu, from South Korea, for $36 million.         \n\nThe Rays cannot even think about playing the high-stakes international game or spending much on major league free agents. So they find a more efficient way, paying more attention to developing their own prospects, trading for those from other teams and keeping them healthy and durable enough to contribute right away in the majors.         \n\n\u201cI think it gets back to each respective organization having a different operating model,\u201d said Andrew Friedman, the Rays\u2019 general manager. \u201cIf we had a lot more in the way of resources, we wouldn\u2019t necessarily operate this same way. But it\u2019s hard to say exactly what would differ and how, because we just have a very laserlike focus on what we can control, and no focus on anything outside of that.\u201d         \n\nIf the Rays beat the Indians on Wednesday, they will meet the Red Sox in the division series. For most of last summer, the Red Sox seemed locked into a payroll quandary similar to that of the Yankees, the Philadelphia Phillies and the Los Angeles Angels, with crippling long-term commitments to the wrong kinds of players. Then the Dodgers offered an escape hatch.         \n\nBelieving correctly that added star power would increase the value of their new television deal, the Dodgers absorbed more than $260 million to add Adrian Gonzalez, Carl Crawford and Josh Beckett. It was a gift, to be sure, but the Red Sox deserve credit for using that savings on seven impact free agents, without spending more than $39 million on any of them or losing a first-round draft pick in the process.         \n\nThe Red Sox added two outfielders (Shane Victorino and Jonny Gomes), a first baseman (Mike Napoli), a closer (Koji Uehara), a shortstop (Stephen Drew), a starter (Ryan Dempster) and a backup catcher (David Ross). The cost of those seven for 2013, before incentives: $53.1 million. The 2013 salaries of Gonzalez, Crawford and Beckett: $56.7 million.         \n\nThe bailout from the Dodgers was an unusual circumstance, perhaps not instructive for other teams. But the Red Sox\u2019 savvy shopping, at least, underscores the notion that bargains exist, if teams are perceptive enough to find them. The Pirates\u2019 decision to push aggressively for Martin, and sign him before the winter meetings, was another example.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had some trades and signings that have been imperfect, and you always will,\u201d Nutting said. \u201cWe just need to minimize the mistakes and maximize the opportunities over and over and over again. It\u2019s a whole series of small decisions.\u201d         \n\nYears of foolish decisions \u2014 signing Derek Bell, trading for Matt Morris, drafting Brad Lincoln over Clayton Kershaw, and so on \u2014 doomed the Pirates to their 20-year streak of losing seasons. Better decisions, and an unwavering belief that there was a path to a night like Tuesday\u2019s, brought them the postseason stage.         \n\nThe Pirates\u2019 revenues and market size will never match those of the Yankees. But for 2013, at least, it did not matter.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never said it was unfair, because as soon as you allow that to creep into your mentality, as soon as you let it creep into your organization, it becomes something to hide behind,\u201d Nutting said. \u201cAnd this has been a take-no-prisoners team from the very beginning. We set our goal to win the world championship. We want to play meaningful games in October. And if that\u2019s your ultimate goal, you have to believe it\u2019s achievable.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/02/sports/baseball/small-market-baseball-teams-find-ways-to-compete.html", "date": "2013-10-01", "description": "Showing that shrewd management matters, the 2013 baseball playoffs include more teams from the bottom 10 in payrolls (Pirates, Indians, Rays and Athletics) than the top 10."}
