{"headline": "Divided House Passes Tax Deal in End to Latest Fiscal Standoff", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Ending a climactic fiscal showdown in the final hours of the 112th Congress, the House late Tuesday passed and sent to  \n legislation to avert big income tax increases on most Americans and prevent large cuts in spending for the Pentagon and other government programs.         \n\nThe measure, brought to the House floor less than 24 hours after its passage in the Senate, was approved 257 to 167, with 85 Republicans joining 172 Democrats in voting to allow income taxes to rise for the first time in two decades, in this case for the highest-earning Americans. Voting no were 151 Republicans and 16 Democrats.         \n\nThe bill was expected to be signed quickly by Mr. Obama, who won re-election on a promise to increase taxes on the wealthy.         \n\nMr. Obama strode into the White House briefing room shortly after the vote, less to hail the end of the fiscal crisis than to lay out a marker for the next one. \u201cThe one thing that I think, hopefully, the new year will focus on,\u201d he said, \u201cis seeing if we can put a package like this together with a little bit less drama, a little less brinkmanship, and not scare the heck out of folks quite as much.\u201d         \n\nIn approving the measure after days of legislative intrigue, Congress concluded its final and most pitched fight over fiscal policy, the culmination of two years of battles over taxes, the federal debt, spending and what to do to slow the growth in popular social programs like  \n.         \n\nThe decision by Republican leaders to allow the vote came despite widespread scorn among House Republicans for the bill, passed overwhelmingly by the Senate in the early hours of New Year\u2019s Day. They were unhappy that it did not include significant spending cuts in health and other social programs, which they say are essential to any long-term solution to the nation\u2019s debt.         \n\nDemocrats, while hardly placated by the compromise, celebrated Mr. Obama\u2019s nominal victory in his final showdown with House Republicans in the 112th Congress, who began their term emboldened by scores of new, conservative members whose reach to the right ultimately tipped them over.         \n\n\u201cThe American people are the real winners tonight,\u201d Representative Bill Pascrell Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, said on the House floor, \u201cnot anyone who navigates these halls.\u201d         \n\nNot a single leader among House Republicans came to the floor to speak in favor of the bill, though Speaker  \n, who rarely takes part in roll calls, voted in favor. Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader, and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the No. 3 Republican, voted no. Representative Paul D. Ryan, the budget chairman who was the Republican vice-presidential candidate, supported the bill.         \n\nDespite the party divisions, many Republicans in their remarks characterized the measure, which allows taxes to go up on household income over $400,000 for individuals and $450,000 for couples but makes permanent tax cuts for income below that level, as a victory of sorts, even as so many of them declined to vote for it.         \n\n\u201cAfter more than a decade of criticizing these tax cuts,\u201d said Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, \u201cDemocrats are finally joining Republicans in making them permanent. Republicans and the American people are getting something really important, permanent tax relief.\u201d         \n\nThe dynamic with the House was a near replay of a fight at the end of 2011 over a  \n break extension. In that showdown, Senate Democrats and Republicans passed legislation, and while House Republicans fulminated, they were eventually forced to swallow it.         \n\nOn Tuesday, as they got a detailed look at the Senate\u2019s fiscal legislation, House Republicans ranging from Midwest pragmatists to  \n-blessed conservatives voiced serious reservations about the measure, emerging from a lunchtime New Year\u2019s Day meeting with their leaders, eyes flashing and faces grim, insisting they would not accept a bill without substantial savings from cuts.         \n\nThe unrest reached to the highest levels as Mr. Cantor told members in a closed-door meeting in the basement of the Capitol that he could not support the legislation in its current form.         \n\nMr. Boehner, who faces a re-election vote on his post on Thursday when the 113th Congress convenes, had grave concerns as well, but he had pledged to allow the House to consider any legislation that cleared the Senate. And he was not eager to have such a major piece of legislation pass with mainly opposition votes, and the outcome could be seen as undermining his authority.         \n\nAdding to the pressure on the House, the fiscal agreement was reached by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate Republican leader, and had deep Republican support in the Senate, isolating the House Republicans in their opposition. Some of the Senate Republicans who backed the bill are staunch conservatives, like Senators Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, with deep credibility among House Republicans.
