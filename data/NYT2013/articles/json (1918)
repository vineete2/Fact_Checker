{"headline": "When the Saint Came Marching In", "body": "\nCollections collect collectors. It doesn\u2019t work the other way around.         \n\nA certain object misses its own kind and communicates that to some person who surrounds it with rhyming items; these become at first a quorum, then a selective, addictive madness.         \n\nOther boys of 7 owned leather satchels full of marbles. But marbles themselves somehow left me cold. So I assembled multiple marble bags. Something about them spoke to me. \u201cHow many do you think you\u2019ll finally need, son?\u201d my father asked, sounding concerned. I arranged my Top 10 best along a windowsill and invited family to a private viewing. They didn\u2019t get it.         \n\nSome people feel most virtuous throwing things out. And when they do? I am right there hauling in the best of that, too. Back when I lived on West 90th Street, East Side trash collection fell on Thursdays. I would hike across the park just past dawn seeking bounty, booty.         \n\nPeople rich enough to redecorate every 10 months are certainly careless with antique furniture. I found four 1760 French side chairs, tapestry seats intact. Claiming them proved easier than persuading any cabdriver to transport the things.         \n\nI planned to sell these bad boys through Christie\u2019s. The auction house authenticated them. But I soon realized: breaking up these four would be like sending quadruplets to foreign foster homes. I did not want that on my conscience. Thirty years later, they remain the closest thing I have to \u201cintact family.\u201d         \n\nYou need a psychology of collecting? I gather those, too. Does buying groups of things leap from some childhood fear of scarcity? You never know when several of exactly this item may come in handy. But often it starts so simply: one object is unique, if lonely. Two objects constitute a pair. Three? Congrats. You\u2019ve started a new collection.         \n\nI was 16 before I met another passionate collector. One summer, I visited England; a new friend took me calling on his dotty, brilliant old aunt. She occupied a quaint house in Kent. Its walls were lined with glass-fronted cases full of what? Ancient shoe buckles. Her specialty: paste (meaning rhinestone) buckles from the footwear of English diplomats and artists from the 18th century. Agitated, she pointed out toe-ornaments worn by  \n and  \n. After handing me a heavy, Sherlock Holmes-worthy magnifying glass, she showed me how one buckle\u2019s workmanship put it in a league beyond the simply pedestrian.         \n\nBy the end of our afternoon, after a scone and much strong tea, I had learned to identify \u2014 as my pal read most of a novel \u2014 the three leading craftsmen. When I left her home, the hostess praised my stamina. Odd, her obsession seemed to bore so many otherwise reasonable people. She whispered, \u201cCare to know the secret of happiness, young man?\u201d         \n\nBorn acquisitive, I nodded.         \n\n\u201cCollect something,\u201d she said.         \n\nI have remained true to her ethic. Living in Manhattan opened me to whole new sets of things to envy, study, gather and imagine stealing. A full-size 1809 German harp, beautifully painted with three goddesses, covered in a pea-green coat of great silvery refinement: mine for $180. Though all its strings were broken, its beauty let it claim a quarter of my one-bedroom. It was like having a cat that never needed feeding.         \n\nThen came a Saturday at that jumbled flea market on the Columbus Avenue school ground; I saw a human being for sale.         \n\nIt was clearly 18th century, with the mannerist upper body, the taffy-pull arms and noble head of a life-size Roman Catholic processional saint. The dealer pointed out her amber glass eyes, cast up to Heaven for help during some early stage of her stoning. Here stood the upper portion of  \n, poor scalp bloodied already. In my Chemical Bank checking account I possessed $810. The antiques dealer, sensing my ardor, lowered his price to $500, a steal. I made him hide her while I ran to the ATM and fished out most of my net worth.         \n\nWhat would I  \nwith her? That was my Republican father\u2019s usual question. Do? Well, I\u2019d look at her. Live with her. Learn from her. Beauty is its own excuse. She\u2019d get on well with the harp.         \n\nI felt I had not actually collected her. No, she had befriended me. We had found each other. This saint had summoned me as Christ drew unto him a posse of fishermen and tax collectors. By living near her, I would be likelier to assemble my own rare saintly thoughts.         \n\nBeautiful as she was, being all plaster and metal and glass, the lady proved heavy. I carried her six blocks before the laughter and quips of passers-by made me hail a cab. One stranger asked, \u201cWhat does she  \n?\u201d         \n\nA taxi stopped; I wrestled her in. I awarded battered Ursula her own seat belt. Our grizzled driver adjusted his rearview mirror. He swiveled it from my face to hers, then growled: \u201cHiya, Doll! Where to?\u201d What a genius New York is!         \n\nNow Ursula and I live in a big, old North Carolina house surrounded by other finds that look like losses to the uninitiated. Visitors are forbidden one word only: hoarding. At no time will that term be used here.
