{"headline": "Why Don\u2019t Advertisers Care About Me Anymore?", "body": "\nGreetings. You people are all irrelevant.         \n\nWell, let\u2019s not paint with too broad a brush.  \n all of you are irrelevant. You 48-year-old boomers bringing up the generational rear? You may have as much as a year left of mattering. Then you, too, will slip out of the 18-to-49 demographic that advertisers most want and TV programmers cater to.         \n\nOuch.         \n\n \n you may well be asking.  \n  \n         \n\nIt\u2019s not that none of you are pierced or tattooed (though if you are, here\u2019s betting there\u2019s a good back story). And it\u2019s not that you don\u2019t buy lots of stuff. It\u2019s just that, Summer of Love generation \u2013 how can we put this? You are not very good at playing hard to get.         \n\nAdvertisers know where you are, and they\u2019ll get to you when they get to you. Your generation is watching five to six hours of TV a day, as much as an hour or so more than the national average,  \n. And though boomers are hardly averse to using digital recording devices or streaming shows, many still engage in \u201cappointment TV.\u201d That means that if \u201cSeinfeld\u201d is on at 9 p.m. Thursday, you will be dutifully sitting on your couch at 8:55 \u2014 though if you were planning to do that this week, we have some bad news for you.         \n\n\u201cThe boomers are an important audience, but boomers are a little easier to find, because they probably watch TV in a more traditional way,\u201d said John C. Verret, an associate professor at the Boston University College of Communication. That\u2019s a polite way of saying that for advertisers, it\u2019s like shooting fish in a barrel \u2014 chubby fish with bad knees and AARP discount cards.         \n\nThose 18- to 49-year-olds, on the other hand, have an air of mystery that advertisers can\u2019t resist. You can never be sure where to find them, and when they do, advertisers pay for the privilege.         \n\nSo in 2010, when \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d managed to pull ahead of \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d it didn\u2019t really help ABC\u2019s bottom line, Bill Carter  \n. \u201cDancing\u201d viewers were older than \u201cIdol\u201d viewers, so even if there were more of them, a 30-second commercial on the first show cost about $209,000, compared with $642,000 on the second.         \n\nHerbert Jack Rotfeld, a professor in the marketing department at Auburn University in Alabama, said in an e-mail that advertisers liked the younger viewers because \u201cin general they are the ages at which people are most willing to change the past way of doing things.\u201d         \n\nHe continued, \u201cSince advertising often tries to attract new customers, or get prior customers to buy more often, younger people are more likely to make this happen.\u201d But advertisers often put too much faith in younger audiences, and when they do they risk losing older customers, Professor Rotfeld said.         \n\nIt\u2019s not just a matter of energy drinks and headphones. Twenty-year-olds might not have much disposable income, but sooner or later they may be buying cars and washing machines, and advertisers want to lay claim to their loyalties now.         \n\nThere is evidence that  \n. As audiences age, The Journal noted, TV shows are increasingly featuring older characters. And advertisers may be starting to realize that baby boomers appear more open to change than older consumers once were. But boomers are unlikely to emerge fully from the shadow of younger viewers.         \n\nDon\u2019t feel too bad. We had our moment. \u201cWhen the boomers were younger,\u201d recalled Professor Vetter, who was in the business for 29 years, \u201cwe were really hammering them.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/07/booming/advertisers-often-ignore-baby-boomers.html", "date": "2013-03-07", "description": "You watch plenty of TV, and you\u2019ve got money to spend, but ever since you passed 49, advertisers are just not that into you."}
