{"headline": "Giants Go From Bad to Worst Start Since \u201996", "body": "\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. \u2014 A lopsided shutout defeat and an 0-3 record signify a conclusive and comprehensive level of ineptitude. But there were still innumerable ways to define a complete, and perhaps foreboding, collapse by the Giants in a 38-0 thrashing by the previously winless  \n on Sunday.         \n\nThe Giants\u2019 largely veteran offensive line was so overmatched early in the game that quarterback  \n was sacked on three consecutive snaps. The Giants\u2019 pass rush, once the hallmark of the team, was virtually nonexistent. A penalty nullified a touchdown run, and other penalties wiped out first downs and advantageous field position. The running game had only 17 yards in the first half \u2014 and 14 came on a desperation scramble by Manning.         \n\nThe punt game was erratic, the place-kicker missed a field-goal attempt and the pass coverage was spotty. A fumble killed another Giants drive. The Panthers (1-2) rushed for nearly 200 yards. Manning was sacked seven times.         \n\nIt was the worst loss in Tom Coughlin\u2019s tenure as the Giants\u2019 coach.         \n\nAdd it all up, and it was the most miserable loss in a season that has seen nothing but despairing defeat. The Giants are 0-3 for the first time since 1996, when they finished 6-10. The team has never made the playoffs after losing its first three games.         \n\nSince 1990, when the current playoff format began, only 3 of the 115 teams that have started 0-3 have reached the postseason.         \n\nThroughout the Giants\u2019 locker room late Sunday afternoon, gloom and confusion were evident.         \n\n\u201cThis is intolerable,\u201d safety Antrel Rolle said. \u201cSomething is going to have to happen. There needs to be a reality check.\u201d         \n\nRolle was asked if the Giants were playing with enough intensity or enthusiasm. \u201cWhether there was fight or not, we didn\u2019t fight enough,\u201d he said.         \n\nManning, who Coughlin said \u201cmust have been hit 20 times,\u201d stood straight and walked without any apparent injury afterward, but he looked wounded nonetheless. In his typically understated but rudimentarily perceptive way, he said, \u201cToo many times we\u2019re going backward instead of moving the ball forward.\u201d         \n\nIn another discerning comment, Manning added, \u201cWords aren\u2019t going to fix anything.\u201d         \n\nJustin Tuck, the defensive captain, who had another quiet game, shook his head when asked what was wrong with the Giants.         \n\n\u201cWe practice hard, but something is missing on game days,\u201d Tuck said. \u201cI\u2019m searching for answers. Right now, we are a desperate team.\u201d         \n\nSolutions will be hard to find because there is virtually no part of the team that is performing efficiently.         \n\nThe running game is so anemic that teams like the Panthers happily cut loose their pass rushers without worrying about guarding against the run. And because the Giants\u2019 offensive line is unable to protect Manning, the passing game is suffering as well.         \n\nDefensively, the secondary usually holds opponents in check early in games \u2014 and did so Sunday \u2014 but the scarcity of a pass rush from some of the Giants\u2019 biggest stars on the defensive line eventually allows opposing passers and receivers to find ways to get open.         \n\nThe Giants\u2019 weaknesses were all on display Sunday. Their first drive ended when Carolina\u2019s Greg Hardy beat left tackle Will Beatty, generally regarded as the Giants\u2019 best offensive lineman, for a sack. On the Giants\u2019 second drive, Manning was sacked on the first two plays because of lapses by the rookie right tackle Justin Pugh and the Pro Bowl right guard Chris Snee.         \n\nThese were not coverage sacks. On the third sack, Giants wide receiver Victor Cruz was running down the field uncovered, but Manning did not have time to see him.         \n\nThe Giants\u2019 running game was no better, with backs sometimes hit in the backfield just after taking the handoff. When there was not contact, there was enough defensive penetration to make the running lanes impassable.         \n\nAfter a Giants penalty on a punt midway through the first quarter, they kicked again, resulting in good field position for Carolina. The Panthers mounted a 12-play scoring drive during which quarterback Cam Newton ran for 40 yards. The possession ended with Mike Tolbert\u2019s fourth-down, 2-yard touchdown run, as the Giants\u2019 goal-line defense \u2014 made up of five 300-pound linemen \u2014 was pushed aside by the Carolina offensive line.
