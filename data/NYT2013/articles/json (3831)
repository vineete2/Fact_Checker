Kennedy students learn about today is not their grandparents\u2019 J.F.K.         \n\nIn a high school textbook edited by John M. Blum in 1968, Kennedy was a tragic hero, cut down too soon in a transformative presidency, who in his mere 1,000 days in office \u201crevived the idea of America as a young, questing, progressive land, facing the future with confidence and hope.\u201d         \n\nBy the mid-'80s, that heady excitement was a distant memory, and Kennedy a diminished one. A textbook written in 1987 by James A. Henretta and several colleagues complained of gauzy \u201cmythologizing\u201d about his tenure and said the high hopes he generated produced only \u201crather meager legislative accomplishments.\u201d         \n\nThe first \u2014 and for many the last \u2014 in-depth lesson that American students learn about the 35th president comes from high school textbooks. And on the eve of the anniversary of his assassination 50 years ago, a review of more than two dozen written since then shows that the portrayal of him has fallen sharply over the years.         \n\nIn general, the picture has evolved from a charismatic young president who inspired youths around the world to a deeply flawed one whose oratory outstripped his accomplishments. Averting war in the Cuban missile crisis got less attention and respect. Legislative setbacks and a deepening commitment in Vietnam got more. The Kennedy-era glamour seemed more image than reality.         \n\nFor example, a 1975 high school text by Clarence Ver Steeg and Richard Hofstadter said that in his handling of the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, \u201cKennedy\u2019s true nature as a statesman became fully apparent.\u201d In \u201cA People and a Nation,\u201d they said his 1963 limited nuclear test ban treaty \u201cwas the greatest single step toward peace since the beginning of the Cold War.\u201d         \n\nOn civil rights, they said, his administration \u201cdid not receive congressional cooperation.\u201d Even so, they wrote, inaccurately, \u201cbuses, hotels, motels and restaurants were largely desegregated\u201d in his presidency. Most of those changes came when the Civil Rights Act was signed by his successor, Lyndon B. Johnson, in 1964.         \n\nUsing the same title in 1982, Mary Beth Norton and several others took a very different approach in a college textbook widely used today in Advanced Placement courses.         \n\nThey said he \u201cpursued civil rights with a notable lack of vigor.\u201d They blamed him for the missile crisis, saying Cuban-Soviet fears of invasion were stoked by the 1961 Bay of Pigs landing and other United States moves against Cuba. They said Kennedy\u2019s real legacy was \u201ca huge military expansion that helped goad the Russians into an accelerated arms race.\u201d         \n\nIn 2009, Joyce Appleby\u2019s \u201cAmerican Journey\u201d said of the missile crisis: \u201cWhile it seemed like a victory at the time, it left a Communist government intact just miles from the U.S. coastline. The humiliation of giving in also prompted the Soviets to begin the largest peacetime military buildup in history.\u201d         \n\nThere are a variety of reasons for the shift. First of all, the dazzle of the handsome young president and the assassination in Dallas elevated Kennedy to a heroic level impossible to maintain.         \n\nAnother is that new writers and editors added different perspectives. In particular, the Vietnam generation began writing and editing, and Kennedy\u2019s role in the war began to matter more. Also, his extramarital affairs became known, providing fodder for criticism. And the release of White House tapes, beginning in 1984, showed a coldly pragmatic politician, not the idealist on issues like civil rights whom people had heard about or imagined.         \n\nFinally, the \u201880s saw a shift in textbook historiography. Gilbert Sewall, the director of the  \n, a nonprofit organization that reviews educational materials, said the older approach concentrated on successes in American history. In the \u201880s, he said, that was replaced by a \u201crevisionist\u201d approach that not only focused on injustices like the mistreatment of Indians but also highlighted flaws of those previously treated as heroic, like slaveholding among the founding fathers. \u201cThe Norton book brought this revisionism into a bright light,\u201d he said.
