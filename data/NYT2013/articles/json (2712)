{"headline": "Bowser, Stay! (Forever)", "body": "\nI heard on the news that  \nin their deceased pets\u2019 cemeteries, and my first thought was: \u201cWhy wait, guys? Jump in with them right now.\u201d         \n\nThat was an ungenerous feeling, I admit, and probably prompted by a steaming pile left behind on the sidewalk by a dog whose owner was yapping away on his phone. I cannot prove it was this particular dog, I hadn\u2019t seen the crime in commission, and I would rather confront a person who is armed with a loaded weapon than an aggrieved New York City pet owner.         \n\nBut back to the new state regulation, which says that cremated human remains may now be plopped into pet graves at licensed animal cemeteries. A great idea, especially for boomers, who even as I write this may be shopping for their eternal condo and moving in soon after. I am especially rooting for the ones who refer to their pets as their grandchildren or grand-dogs. As in, \u201cLet me show you the picture of my new grand-dog.\u201d I\u2019ll tell you the truth, that particular grand-dog, a springer spaniel puppy, was pretty cute.         \n\nBut like so much well-intentioned regulation, I\u2019m afraid this human/pet shared burial site thing hasn\u2019t been very well thought out. I speak here from a limited perspective, having attended mostly human burials, but there was this time, growing up in the Catskills, we had a weepy send-off for Peaches, our amorous and far-ranging yellow tomcat, and shortly after the interment the actual Peaches ambled in, looking as if he wouldn\u2019t mind a cigarette. Not that I couldn\u2019t recognize our own cat, but after a run-in with a fast-moving vehicle it is difficult to tell one yellow tomcat from another, especially as they all seem to have that same droopy ear. And by the way \u2014 just to establish my animal-loving chops \u2014 I was very upset when I thought Peaches had expired, although, as the neighborhood was sprinkled with many whiskery little Peacheroos, I knew his seed would survive. A good thing, too, because this was way before animal cloning.         \n\nBut to have been buried with Peaches, had a pet cemetery existed in the Catskills? No way.         \n\nFirst of all, I have no belief in an afterlife, which I assume puts me in the minority when it comes to burying me on the lone prairie with my beloved palomino Trigger.         \n\nAn aside on Trigger: Long, long ago, when I was a young reporter with my natural hair color, I interviewed Roy Rogers and he told me the day he met Trigger was one of the best days of his life; he got on that horse, he said, and rode him 100 yards and  \n. He went on about meeting Trigger much longer than he went on about meeting his wife, Dale, but even Roy didn\u2019t mention wanting to be buried with the nag. After Trigger\u2019s death he had him stuffed, which is a very nice idea, although not practical in a New York City apartment. Another bit of information about the horse dead: prize-winning thoroughbreds are sometimes buried, but usually only their heads, hooves and hearts. I throw this in to be of comfort to the animal people. There is a reason there are no open caskets for horses.         \n\nWhere was I? Oh right, death and Peaches.         \n\nSee, even if I did believe in an afterlife, the idea of reliving the things I shared with Peaches is not that compelling: getting up to let him out, getting up to let him in, opening a can of cat food so he can turn his nose up at it and walk away with his tail in the air, who needs it? And by the way, Peaches was a major hair-ball puker. How would you like to be parked for all eternity with that? And shedding? Peaches could be passionately in love in the next county but if you put on a black sweater it would be catus interruptus, he would be back in a matter of minutes to leap up on you and ruin it.         \n\nNow you could argue that I did not have a truly close relationship with Peaches so I could never understand the meaning of a shared pet/human resting place and you would have a point.         \n\nSo let\u2019s move on to a true case of interspecies love, that between my late father, Bernie, and his dog, Gibora. Gibora is Hebrew for \u201cheroine,\u201d which she was probably called because \u201cobese, lactose-intolerant dog of unknown age\u201d didn\u2019t easily translate. Gibora was a very sweet mixed breed, a cross of a collie and the  \n whose weight problems were due to daily treats of ice cream cones. I don\u2019t want to point the finger here; let\u2019s just say she didn\u2019t buy them herself. In her old age, Gibora was so fat my father had to lift her into his pickup truck. (We were upstate Jews. We had pickup trucks.)         \n\nMy father loved this dog, frequently confusing her name with those of his three children, and when she died at a fat old age, it is possible he might have entertained the notion of having her cremains nearby in an appropriate container, say a bronzed, three-gallon ice cream tub. Unlikely, as my father had grown up on a dairy farm where cows were never referred to as \u201cmy grand-calf,\u201d but possible.         \n\nBut he would  \nhave wanted to be buried with the dog. He would have expected to be buried near his mother, who was born in the old country, and considered dogs (this will come as a shock to many of you) animals, which she threw out of the house. Also, if pet cemeteries were the size of the human cemeteries on Long Island, where his father was buried, it would have been even worse.         \n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Bernie? I thought you told me he was three rows past \u2018Dick and Jane and Spot: Dead, Dead, Dead\u2019 and I\u2019m standing right here and all I\u2019m seeing is \u2018Best Friends Till That Winter We Got Snowed In: Fern Arable and Wilbur.'\u201d         \n\nAnd now that this law is in place, what will we be looking at for the funerals? Suppose I find a cat I truly love and a peaceful little pet cemetery behind a puppy mill. What is the rabbi going to say?         \n\n\u201cIt is fitting, today, we lay Joyce to rest beside her roving tomcat, because God knows she went out with enough of them. At least this one didn\u2019t ask to borrow money.\u201d         \n\nI have no idea where I will be buried. But I\u2019ll tell you one thing: I won\u2019t be sharing.
