{"headline": "Groups Want Bad Image of Penn State to Go Away", "body": "\nSTATE COLLEGE, Pa. \u2014 During the first week of classes at Penn State last month, John Nichols sat in his office in the old wing of the Willard Building, across the lawn from Old Main, fuming about what people have been saying, for two years now, about the university he loves.         \n\nThe campus was bustling. The students had returned. This bucolic town\u2019s main drag, College Avenue, had come alive. Stores sold shirts that read, \u201cBillieve\u201d and \u201cO\u2019Brien\u2019s Lions.\u201d Football season was close, and almost everyone seemed excited for Coach Bill O\u2019Brien\u2019s second year.         \n\nNichols sat behind his large wooden desk, surrounded by four full bookshelves. He has spent 36 years at Penn State. He raised his children here. He is a professor emeritus and a former chairman of the faculty senate. Now he was talking about  \n and  \n and he was getting angry. He sat up straighter. His eyes bulged. He threw his hands up.         \n\n\u201cJust this last weekend, I was with some of my closest friends in another state,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course the subject always comes up \u2014 always comes up. It\u2019s like a scarlet letter. And when I say that most of what you\u2019ve read is not true, they look at you like \u2014 even close friends \u2014 they look at you like: \u2018Are you a Holocaust denier? You\u2019ve drunk the Penn State Kool-Aid. What other conspiracy theory do you have?\u2019         \n\n\u201cCan you imagine the frustration when you know that there\u2019s been a gross mischaracterization of what has happened at Penn State? And that I and my kids who graduated from  \n, my friends and colleagues here, are going to have to live with being guilty for crimes we did not commit?\u201d         \n\nNichols is among those in the larger Penn State community \u2014 including current and former faculty, alumni and fans \u2014 still upset at how the child sexual abuse scandal involving Sandusky, Paterno\u2019s longtime top assistant, was handled by the institution\u2019s leadership. Still upset about the report put forth by the former F.B.I. director Louis J. Freeh that said Paterno and others covered up Sandusky\u2019s crimes. Still upset about the N.C.A.A. sanctions based on the report, and what they say was the \u201cfalse narrative\u201d perpetuated by the news media. Still upset about how they thought the scandal came to define Penn State unfairly.         \n\nTerry Engelder, a professor of geosciences in his 28th year at Penn State, said in an e-mail that some faculty members were still agitated because \u201cthe rush to unfair judgment has done unspeakable damage to the university\u2019s reputation worldwide.\u201d         \n\nThe scandal continues to have ripple effects. The university\u2019s board of trustees has authorized Penn State to spend about $60 million to settle about 30 outstanding claims with Sandusky\u2019s victims. The former university president Graham B. Spanier, the former athletic director Tim Curley and the former university vice president Gary Schultz are set to stand trial for their suspected roles in a cover-up of Sandusky\u2019s actions. Sandusky was convicted last year of 45 counts of child sexual abuse and sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison. The football team is prohibited from playing in a bowl game for three more seasons, and it has scholarship restrictions that run through the 2017 season.         \n\nNichols does not want to forget the scandal just yet. He said that the entire university had been implicated in the public\u2019s mind, that it has been accepted as fact that there was a cover-up, he says, without due process.         \n\nOf the five men who are most connected to the scandal, Nichols pointed out, only Sandusky has been convicted. Paterno died last year, and Spanier, Curley and Schultz have yet to stand trial. If they are found not guilty of the charges against them \u2014 including perjury, conspiracy and endangering the welfare of children \u2014 Nichols said it would cast doubt on the legitimacy of the Freeh report, and the N.C.A.A. penalties would have no basis.         \n\n\u201cI think a lot of people \u2014 this includes me \u2014 are really rooting that they be found not guilty,\u201d he said, because that would start \u201crolling back the narrative.\u201d         \n\nHe sighed. \u201cWe would like to think it\u2019d be Duke 2, the Duke lacrosse case, where the truth would finally emerge,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think there\u2019s a growing sense that that\u2019s probably not going to happen.\u201d         \n\nLast year, the faculty senate appointed Nichols to lead a study meant to complement the Freeh report. The study examined the current state of the university and ways to move forward. His report was released in March 2013 to little fanfare. It concluded, in part, that more collaboration and better communication was needed between the board of trustees and the rest of the university.
