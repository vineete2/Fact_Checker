{"headline": "How Much Is Michael Bolton Worth to You?", "body": "\nA few weeks ago, I met Barry Arakelian a minute after he got scammed at a  \n concert. Arakelian had paid a scalper $375 for two tickets (face value: $135) outside the Beacon Theater in Manhattan. The tickets, however, turned out to be fakes, and Arakelian, who was getting the evil eye from his girlfriend, approached a nearby police officer for help. But the officer said that he couldn\u2019t do anything unless Arakelian could locate the scalper in the crush of people. By that point the scalper was long gone; Arakelian was embarrassed. Naturally, a minute later, he turned and shouted to no one in particular, \u201cWho\u2019s got two tickets?\u201d         \n\nWithin a few moments, a massive man in a Mets hat offered him two tickets for $450. It seemed like a lot, but Arakelian accepted almost immediately. And as I watched him enter the Beacon \u2014 these tickets worked \u2014 I was struck by the economic oddness of the whole experience. Tom Petty is a scalper\u2019s dream. He may still be able to sell out Madison Square Garden, but he often prefers smaller venues like the Beacon, where there is a large demand for a shorter supply of tickets. Petty also insists on keeping tickets below market price. And while I can see why a veteran artist would try to accommodate his fans, I also wondered why Petty and his promoter would price tickets so low when there were clearly people willing to pay much, much more.         \n\nFew products are so underpriced that an entire subsidiary industry exists to take advantage of the discrepancy. When there is excess demand for a new car or phone, some people might sell theirs at a markup on eBay, but there\u2019s nobody across the street from the dealership or Best Buy offering it right away for double the sticker price; there certainly isn\u2019t an entire corporation built on exploiting companies\u2019 failure to properly price items initially. Yet concerts and sporting events consistently price their tickets low enough that street scalpers risk jail time to hawk marked-up tickets, and StubHub makes hundreds of millions a year in revenue.         \n\nMost concertgoers don\u2019t usually consider ticket prices as incredibly low. After barely keeping up with inflation for decades, concert prices have risen wildly since 1996, or around the time when baby boomers, who helped start the industry, aged into a lot more disposable income. (It was also around this time that Internet piracy made the music industry more reliant on concert revenues.) These days, prices can seem incredibly high.  \n, who charged more than $1,000 for some seats at a concert in Rome, inspired so much anger that she canceled the show. Yet to an economist, the very existence of scalpers and companies like StubHub proves that tickets are far too cheap to balance supply and demand. Pascal Courty, an economist at the University of Victoria, in Canada, who has spent the better part of 20 years studying the secondary-ticket market, has identified two distinct pricing styles. Some artists, like Streisand and Michael Bolton, seem to charge as much as the market will bear \u2014 better seats generally cost a lot more; shows in larger cities, with higher demand, are far more expensive, too. (If you want to catch Bolton on the cheap, head to Western New York.) The second group comprises notable acts, like  \n and Pearl Jam, that usually keep prices far below market value and offer only a few price points. An orchestra seat to see the Boss in Jersey costs only about $50 more than the nosebleeds in Albany.         \n\nSpringsteen\u2019s style might seem more altruistic, but performers who undercharge their fans can paradoxically reap higher profits than those who maximize each ticket price. It\u2019s a strategy similar to the one employed by ventures like casinos and cruise ships, which take a hit on admission prices but make their money once the customers are inside. Concert promoters can overcharge on everything from beer sales to T-shirts, and the benefits of low-priced tickets can accrue significantly over the years as loyal fans return. In part, this explains why artists like Springsteen and Petty are content to undercharge at the gate while others, perhaps wary of their own staying power, are eager to capitalize while they can.         \n\nBut by leaving money on the table, Springsteen and his ilk might be doing their fans an inadvertent disservice. Jared Smith, the president of Ticketmaster North America, told me that the artists who charge the least tend to see the most scalping. Springsteen and others have angrily denounced scalping at their shows, but their prices are guaranteeing the very existence of that secondary market, which has become ever more sophisticated over the years. Many scalpers now use computer programs to monopolize ticket buying when seats go on sale, which forces many fans to buy from resellers. One of the surest ways to eliminate scalping, Smith told me, is to charge a more accurate price in the first place.         \n\nAs an industry leader, with access to nearly limitless data, Ticketmaster can determine fairly precisely just how much fans are willing to pay for every kind of show. Generally speaking, Smith says, artists who charged a lot more for the best 1,000 or so seats would reduce the incentive for scalpers to buy these tickets; it would also allow artists to charge even less for the rest of the seats in the house. Kid Rock told me that on his forthcoming tour, he is planning on charging a lot more than usual for \u201cplatinum seating\u201d so that all other seats \u2014 including those in the first two rows \u2014 can be around $20. \u201cIt\u2019s a smart thing for me to do,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make money; I\u2019m going to make money. I want to prove there is a better way to do this.\u201d         \n\nSmith, meanwhile, spends much of his time these days trying to persuade artists that increasing the price of their top tickets to near the point where supply meets demand is not greedy but equitable for their fans. \u201cEvery time I convince an act, we get three more artists to sign up,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s more and more acceptance.\u201d         \n\nThe impact is already being felt on the street. Outside the Petty show, one scalper told me that, back in the \u201980s and \u201990s, he made more than $70,000 a year reselling tickets. But now he is lucky to clear $30,000. \u201cA $300 night is a home run now,\u201d he said. His business has suffered tremendously since 2007, when New York State legalized ticket reselling and helped supply meet demand. \u201cStubHub is killing us,\u201d he said. Indeed, Internet-based ticket reselling has doubled in the past five years and is now projected to be a roughly $4.5 billion business. After fighting the secondary market for years, some have surrendered. The Mets, like 27 other baseball teams, have signed a deal with StubHub, and the Yankees recently signed one with Ticketmaster, to create a formal secondary market. The organizations might as well get a piece of the action.         \n\nThis doesn\u2019t seem to bother fans. Barry Arakelian told me that he had a great time at the Petty show, regardless of the fact that he paid $825 to see a show that should have cost about $200. He would have paid even more, he said, if he knew the money was going to an artist he admired. \u201cAnd if I paid the higher price,\u201d he said proudly, \u201cyou\u2019d shut out the scalpers.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/09/magazine/the-secret-science-of-scalping-tickets.html", "date": "2013-06-04", "description": "There\u2019s a reason scalpers have confused economists for decades."}
