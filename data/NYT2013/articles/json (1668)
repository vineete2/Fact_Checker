{"headline": "Peter Berg Threw Himself Under a Bus. Now What?", "body": "\nPeter Berg wanted me to box with him. \u201cCome on, you\u2019re a tough guy,\u201d he said. I tried to disabuse him of that notion. I told him I\u2019d been in only one fight in my adult life, and I lost that one.         \n\nWe went to Team Tapia Boxing Academy in Albuquerque, where Berg was scouting locations for the film he had written and was directing, \u201cLone Survivor,\u201d based on a book with the same title about a Navy SEAL mission in Afghanistan that went terribly wrong in 2005. Berg fell in love with boxing when he was a 14-year-old freshman at the Taft School in Connecticut. \u201cI was on fire,\u201d he said, \u201ca seething ball of energy moving at a speed I couldn\u2019t explain.\u201d He was angry and disruptive \u201cand diagnosed as a troublemaker,\u201d he said. \u201cToday it\u2019d be A.D.H.D., and I\u2019d be Ritalined up.\u201d Instead a dean took him after class to his basement, where Berg and other disruptive students learned \u201cto dissipate all our energy\u201d by fighting. Boxing calmed him. \u201cYou can\u2019t box angry,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to be disciplined. Before boxing, I was this angry kid ready to fight if someone said, \u2018Hello.\u2019 \u201d         \n\nThrough boxing, Berg became fascinated with what he referred to as \u201cthe psychology of violence,\u201d which has informed most of the things he has directed or acted in. Sports violence (\u201cFriday Night Lights,\u201d \u201cThe Great White Hype\u201d); criminal violence (\u201cVery Bad Things,\u201d \u201cThe Last Seduction\u201d); and military violence (\u201cA Midnight Clear,\u201d \u201cThe Kingdom,\u201d \u201cBattleship,\u201d \u201cLone Survivor\u201d). But violence on the screen is never as viscerally satisfying as it is in the ring. \u201cThere\u2019s a truth to the violence of boxing,\u201d Berg said. \u201cYou have a very real threat, an opponent.\u201d Movie violence is make believe.         \n\nAt Tapia, the manager taped up my hands while Berg shadowboxed in the ring, waiting for me. Berg is 51, hyperactive and lean, his long arms rippled with muscles and veins. Once my gloves were on, I pounded them together and stood up.         \n\nLater that night I called my wife. She asked how the boxing went. I said, \u201cI broke Peter\u2019s jaw.\u201d She said, \u201cI hope he can still talk.\u201d I told her I was kidding. It was make-believe. I got a lesson on the heavy bag instead.         \n\n \nBerg told me to meet him for dinner at a steakhouse on the outskirts of Albuquerque. I waited at the bar till Berg rushed in late, looking spent, and sat down. He\u2019d been at Kirtland Air Force Base checking out \u201cchoppers\u201d \u2014 Berg likes to use military jargon \u2014 and also scouting mountains for the big shootout between the Taliban and the SEALs. (In the movie, which is due out at the end of this year, the shootout comes across as one of the most realistic depictions of close-in combat in film.) \u201cI must have climbed 30 mountains,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need different locations because we couldn\u2019t get access to Indian land.\u201d He raised his eyebrows. \u201cIt\u2019s sacred, except for the land with casinos on it, I guess.\u201d         \n\nBerg was exhausting himself making \u201cLone Survivor\u201d on the cheap. A 42-day shoot, a $40 million budget, a list of producers as long as his arm whose only required movie expertise was the ability to fork over at least a million dollars to get a credit \u2014 and still, his team was scuffling around for money until a few weeks before filming was about to start last fall. \u201cUniversal will release it,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I have to deliver the finished film to them.\u201d Berg had been trying to make \u201cLone Survivor\u201d for five years. \u201cI\u2019m a patriot,\u201d he said. \u201cI admire our military, their character, code of honor, belief systems. I lived with the SEALs, their families, went to their funerals. I went to Iraq. Did you ever see anyone killed? I did.\u201d Berg is infatuated with heroes, military, sports and, sometimes, because of his teenage years, misfits.         \n\nHe was directing for scale, the minimum salary allowed by the Directors Guild (which in this case was $17,000 a week), and had got most of his crew and actors (including Taylor Kitsch and Mark Wahlberg) to work at a discount too. No one worked for scale on his most recent movie, \u201cBattleship,\u201d which was supposed to be the summer blockbuster of 2012. Instead it was one of the biggest science-fiction-movie busts in the history of the genre. \u201cBattleship\u201d had problems from its inception, beginning with the idea of trying to make a movie out of a board game. Berg knew \u201cBattleship\u201d was in trouble even before it was released. When we spoke by phone last summer, he told me: \u201cYou should go see it. It\u2019s fun, but leave your brain outside the theater.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/magazine/can-peter-berg-redeem-himself-after-battleship.html", "date": "2013-08-15", "description": "This time the director is making the movie he really wanted to make \u2014 and doing it on the cheap."}
