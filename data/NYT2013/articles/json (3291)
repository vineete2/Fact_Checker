{"headline": "In South Bronx, Memories of Ch\u00e1vez and the Aid He Gave", "body": "\nLucia Solano became something of a stalker when  \n visited the South Bronx in 2005.         \n\nMs. Solano\u2019s organization, Servicio Basico Educativo, was $18,000 behind in rent and faced eviction. Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, she was sure, could help. He was the controversial leftist president of  \n who was in town for a United Nations General Assembly meeting and seemed to be developing a soft spot for the South Bronx.         \n\n\u201cI was following him,\u201d Ms. Solano recalled, recounting the three events she attended for a chance to approach Mr. Ch\u00e1vez. \u201cI finally was able to ask him for assistance, and he said, \u2018I am not a God.\u2019 I told him I knew he was not a God, but that I had a good cause.\u201d         \n\nNot long after the visit, Ms. Solano received a check to cover the back rent.         \n\nThe contribution became the first of millions of dollars in charitable giving that would signify Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s legacy in the South Bronx, a neighborhood filled with the kind of poor and working-class residents whose struggles struck a chord with the fiery populist leader. The memories of Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s visit and his link to New York were recalled on Wednesday, the day after he died at 58.         \n\nHis visit was the result of an invitation from Representative Jos\u00e9 E. Serrano, a Democrat from the South Bronx who had also once invited Fidel Castro to the neighborhood. Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, the congressman said, made it clear he did not want to visit \u201cpower brokers.\u201d         \n\nInstead, he spent several hours one September morning greeting local leaders at a community development corporation, where tables were set up and various groups distributed brochures as if the event were a college fair at a high school. Mr. Ch\u00e1vez stopped to chat with neighborhood advocates one by one, several people recalled, impressing everyone with his uncanny ability to recall obscure historical facts about each person\u2019s home country.         \n\n\u201cWe expected, honestly, for him to walk through, say a few words and leave,\u201d Mr. Serrano said. \u201cThree and a half hours later, he was still there. \u2018What\u2019s the name of your organization? What do they do? How are you funded? Why did you name it that?\u2019 He did this table by table by table. Then he would quote a poet, artist, politician or historical figure from Panama, Mexico, the Dominican Republic or wherever the person was from.\u201d         \n\nMr. Ch\u00e1vez seemed to snap his fingers and order a member of his entourage to make money available or solve a community problem. He left people with the impression that he had looked at the South Bronx, saw the slums of Caracas and fell in love with the place.         \n\nHe ended the morning dancing with a straw hat perched on his head.         \n\nOut of that visit was born a community-relations program that would donate $5 million to grass-roots groups in the South Bronx, paying for a variety of projects, including the restoration of the Bronx River, after-school classes, literacy programs and food cooperatives.         \n\nThe money came from Citgo, the American subsidiary of the Venezuelan oil company, which also provided oil to heat apartments.         \n\nToday, the effort Mr. Ch\u00e1vez started is largely in tatters. The umbrella organization created by his country\u2019s oil largess, Petro Bronx, stopped getting money after 2010, although other projects are being financed. Many of the organizations that Petro Bronx financed have folded, and the few that survived cut the programs. Ms. Solano\u2019s organization received almost $300,000 from Citgo over three years, but the financing has not been renewed.         \n\n\u201cCitgo saw themselves as a U.S. corporation; they were leery of mixing a social movement with corporate goals and the bottom line,\u201d said F\u00e9lix Leo Campos, a New York City filmmaker who made  \n. \u201cWe were too lefty, and the direct line to Hugo Ch\u00e1vez was missing.\u201d         \n\nFernando Garay, a spokesman for Citgo, declined to comment on the Petro Bronx program. The division that took over Citgo\u2019s community projects, the Simon Bolivar Foundation, did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment.         \n\nSouth Bronx\u2019s love affair Mr. Ch\u00e1vez was not without its critics. He had emerged from a bruising two-month national strike and a military coup that led to his brief ouster. He was accused of making bold and illegal moves to consolidate power.         \n\nMr. Ch\u00e1vez was widely despised in places like South Florida, where many Venezuelans there consider themselves exiles of his government. But this was the South Bronx. And in this Congressional district, among the nation\u2019s poorest, Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s anti-elitist rhetoric caught on.         \n\n\u201cHe related to the Bronx, because in so many ways it was just like the Latin America that he wanted to change,\u201d Mr. Serrano said. \u201cHe felt very comfortable with the people, and the people felt comfortable with him. It was not an awkward visit. We can criticize his comments or the world leaders he befriended, but you can\u2019t deny the work he did in the Bronx.\u201d         \n\nMr. Ch\u00e1vez was perhaps remembered most fondly in the Bronx for the gallons of  \n that began arriving about two months after his trip.         \n\nCitgo has donated seven million gallons to the Bronx in the eight years since the program started, according to Citizens Energy, the Boston organization that manages the project.         \n\n\u201cHere was a guy who the corporate media tried to push us to dislike by saying, \u2018This guy is trying to empower himself forever,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Julio Pabon, a City Council candidate who participated in a Citgo-financed food co-op. \u201cThat\u2019s not how we saw him in the Bronx. In the Bronx, he was a guy who came here and talked about helping people so they didn\u2019t get strung out trying to pay their heating bills.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/07/nyregion/in-the-south-bronx-memories-of-chavez-and-his-largess.html", "date": "2013-03-06", "description": "Some residents and local leaders recalled that Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s visit to the South Bronx in 2005 led to donations in oil and money from the Venezuelan leader."}
