{"headline": "Teachers Ask About Mission They Lived By", "body": "\nThere are few more pleasurable ways to pass an hour than to talk with veteran teachers who burn with a passion for their chosen work \u2014 lighting bonfires in the minds of children.         \n\nI sat last week in a hilly playground off University Avenue in the Bronx with Eloise Pescador Martinez, 58, and Richard DeZonie, 61. They have taught for three decades each at Holy Spirit School, down the street. \u201cLong ago I came to the realization,\u201d Mr. DeZonie said, \u201cthat I love that look in a child\u2019s eye when you\u2019ve reached him.\u201d         \n\nMs. Martinez nodded, emphatic. \u201cI love it!\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re family, generation after generation of family.\u201d         \n\nTheir family is being torn asunder. In a few weeks, the Archdiocese of New York will shutter their school, 1 of 25 to close this year. Their children will be dispersed. A few veteran teachers will find toeholds in a shrinking Roman Catholic system. Many will be cut adrift, middle-aged wayfarers in a bad market. For their decades of modestly paid work, the diocese offers this parsimonious going-away gift: Teachers can choose a $5,000 severance check or six months of health coverage. Not both.         \n\nSo which will it be? Ms. Martinez\u2019s daughter has asthma \u2014 she\u2019ll opt for insurance. Mr. DeZonie\u2019s wife teaches at Holy Spirit as well; he\u2019ll take the insurance and she\u2019ll take the money. \u201cMan, it\u2019s not much after three decades, no it really isn\u2019t,\u201d he said.         \n\nCardinal Timothy M. Dolan projects a jovial official face of Catholicism in this city. He can crack a joke with practiced timing. At the recent conclave in Rome, where bishops and cardinals paraded about in glorious raiment, he was regarded as quite the comer.         \n\nBack home, the Catholic Church and the archdiocese give the appearance of an empire sunk in financial despondency. Church attendance and school enrollment has tumbled for decades.         \n\nSome of the financial problems are owing to the church\u2019s own lies and omissions around the sexual abuse scandals involving priests.         \n\nCardinal Dolan and his school superintendent, who declined to comment, twice cut the system close to the bone in recent years, eliminating nearly 60 schools. They have sold off and leased real estate, raising many millions of dollars.         \n\nThe superintendent, Timothy J. McNiff, said recently that the diocesan schools were stable. There\u2019s a survivor\u2019s comfort to be had in that. But you wonder what becomes of those who have turned to the beacon that has been Holy Spirit, an elementary school that sits atop the bony spine of the Morris Heights neighborhood. Generational waves of immigrants, Italians and Irish, Puerto Ricans and Dominicans, Mexicans and Ghanaians, have come through its doors.         \n\nThe tuition at Holy Spirit is a pittance compared with a Dalton or a Brearley. And the archdiocese deserves credit for subsidizing these costs. But for a Ghanaian immigrant working two jobs and pulling down $25,000 a year, that tuition looms as a mountainous sum.         \n\nAny talk of subsidy, however, must include the teachers. A parochial school veteran with 20 years of service and a master\u2019s degree makes $60,000; that\u2019s a touch above the starting pay for a public-school teacher. Nor are parochial school pensions remotely comparable to those of public-school teachers.         \n\nThat\u2019s O.K., sort of. Ms. Martinez, who first spoke to me one evening after choir practice, talked easily of their mission. But this is a city grown more expensive by the week, and the gap between the wealthy few and the middle-class many who scrape by gets wider.         \n\nMs. Martinez is divorced and has twice dipped into her small retirement savings for her daughter\u2019s tuition. She sprints paycheck to paycheck. \u201cI always said I didn\u2019t get into this for the money,\u201d she said. \u201cI guess I was right.\u201d         \n\nSacrifices are easiest when shared. No one likes to think of themselves as na\u00efve. Last time, the archdiocese said it had set aside $7.4 million for a \u201cteacher transition plan.\u201d That was sophistry.         \n\nThe diocese spent $600,000 on severance the last time it closed schools. It appears to have counted its payments into unemployment insurance to pad that package.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve told my landlord I\u2019m facing a layoff,\u201d Ms. Martinez said. \u201cI want to know: Where\u2019s that Catholic mission we have lived with all of our lives?\u201d         \n\nWe walked back down University Boulevard toward the Romanesque tower of the school. We passed children, who smiled, waved and shouted out her name. \u201cI try to separate my faith from the institution,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cMy faith now? It\u2019s those children.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/nyregion/closing-of-holy-spirit-school-leaves-teachers-adrift.html", "date": "2013-06-03", "description": "Holy Spirit School is closing, taking jobs, salaries and purpose from many veteran teachers."}
