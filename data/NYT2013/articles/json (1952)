{"headline": "Striving Immigrants Find Long Distance Running Far From Lonely in New York City", "body": "\nOn a recent foggy Sunday in Central Park, a group of runners lingered near the finish line of a half-marathon, recounting their efforts in Spanish. They had finished the 13.1-mile course before many entrants reached the halfway point.         \n\nJulio Sauce, a 41-year-old New Yorker from Ecuador, clutched a glass plaque he had earned for finishing first in his age group. Having averaged better than six minutes a mile on the hilly course, Sauce said he was tired \u2014 but not just from the race.         \n\nFrom 2:30 p.m. Saturday to 12:30 a.m. Sunday, Sauce had worked as a cook at 44 & X Hells Kitchen, a Midtown restaurant. After the train ride home to Coney Island, he had only three hours of sleep before returning to Manhattan for the early race. Undeterred, he pronounced himself ready for his next big event: the  \n on Sunday.         \n\n\u201cLiving here is hard work,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are used to hard work. Marathons are just more of it.\u201d         \n\nSauce belongs to West Side Runners, one of New York City\u2019s oldest and fastest running teams. It is also the city\u2019s most diverse: nearly all of its 300 members were born outside the United States. Converging here from five continents, runners from places as far away as Colombia and Gambia, Japan and Brazil, all regularly toe the starting line at weekend road races in matching red-and-white WSX singlets.         \n\nThe team\u2019s Ethiopian runners are world-class. But most West Side Runners are working class, part of New York\u2019s often marginalized Latino community. Members of this close-knit crew rarely win anything more than the reward of crossing the finish line a little faster than the time before. And yet they remain some of the city\u2019s most devoted and talented runners, finishing at the front of the pack and making casual runners look positively lethargic.         \n\nThey are busboys, dishwashers, construction workers. They are on their feet at enervating jobs all day and often all night. Many do not have health insurance. Most find it difficult to afford the increasingly hefty fees New York Road Runners charges for its races, especially the marathon, which now costs at least $227.         \n\nFor Sauce, that is half a week\u2019s paycheck.\u00a0         \n\nAnother West Side Runner is Luis Cesareo, a 32-year-old from Mexico. Cesareo works as a livery dispatcher from 4 p.m. to 8 a.m. and sleeps during the day.         \n\nThis will be his second marathon. He is hoping to finish in around 2 hours 40 minutes, which should land him close to the top 100 male finishers in the 47,000-runner field.         \n\nRacing is a powerful motivator for him.         \n\n\u201cI love the New York marathon,\u201d Cesareo said. \u201cMy teammates, and the Mexican people, are all around. When I run so hard, it feels almost like I\u2019m dying. That\u2019s when I feel most alive.\u201d         \n\nBill Staab, the president of West Side Runners, said: \u201cThey work unbelievably hard at their jobs, but few of these guys have major successes financially. Whereas success in running is available to everyone. They know if you put in the work, you\u2019ll see payoff.\u201d         \n\nHispanic immigrants were drawn to West Side Runners the same way they flocked to various cities around the country: through word of mouth. The Colombian government sent three runners to the New York City Marathon in 1980. (One, a former bullfighter from Bogot\u00e1, started running to build his speed in the ring.) After they became top athletes for the newly founded West Side Runners, other local Colombians joined in scores. Then came Ecuadoreans and Mexicans, often migrating from soccer. The club had found its backbone. \u00a0         \n\nIn the United States, competitive distance running has long been a sport of the relatively affluent and the white.         \n\n\u201cBack then, other teams would laugh at us because we were mostly Latino,\u201d Staab said, referring to the 1980s. \u201cThere was stigma.\u201d         \n\nThe team\u2019s fast white runners were snatched up by sponsored competitors, Staab said, while the comparably talented Latinos were left behind. Then something changed.         \n\n\u201cWe began to beat them,\u201d Staab said. \u201cWe became one of the best running teams in New York City.\u201d         \n\nAs the volunteer head of his team, Staab is part administrator, part benefactor and occasional innkeeper. He helps arrange athletic visas. He pays race entry fees for many members who cannot afford them. He has gone to court with runners caught in the mix-ups that plague people in unfamiliar places with unfamiliar rules and unfamiliar languages. Staab usually has several Ethiopian runners staying at his two-bedroom apartment on the Upper West Side for weeks or even months at a time.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a big place,\u201d he said wryly. \u201cBut they\u2019re thin; they fit just fine.\u201d\u00a0         \n\nStaab is fiercely protective of his runners and approaches his role with a zeal that feels diplomatic and missionary.         \n\n\u201cI try to show them that in America, you help other people,\u201d he said.         \n\nA Peace Corps veteran and former steel importer-exporter, Staab, 74, lives on  \n and a pension. He travels to out-of-town races on discount bus lines and does not have a cellphone. He says that leading the club has become a focus in his life.         \n\n\u201cI tell these guys, you\u2019re lucky I don\u2019t have a family, or none of this would exist,\" Staab said.\u00a0         \n\nIn many ways, his runners\u2019 lives adhere to the patterns characteristic of the city\u2019s striving class; unstable jobs and transient living situations can upset training regimens.
