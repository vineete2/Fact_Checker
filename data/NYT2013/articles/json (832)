{"headline": "Groups That Are Often at Odds Join Forces to Oppose Spitzer\u2019s Campaign", "body": "\nAlarmed by  \n\u2019s momentum in his unexpected bid to win citywide office, an unlikely coalition of business leaders, women\u2019s groups and labor unions is vowing to finance an ambitious effort to thwart the former governor\u2019s ambition.         \n\nThe interest groups, which often spar with one another over competing agendas and priorities, have found rare common cause in their antipathy toward Mr. Spitzer, who infuriated the business community with his aggressive posture toward Wall Street, who offended feminists by paying for sex with prostitutes and who alienated unions by taking on a labor-backed candidate.         \n\nNow, they are pledging to raise and spend at least $1.5 million on advertising, direct mail and field work in an effort to persuade voters that Mr. Spitzer would be a poor choice for comptroller, New York City\u2019s chief financial officer. That money may be dwarfed by the amount Mr. Spitzer, whose family has a real estate fortune, could spend on his own, but is enough to alter the contours of the campaign, particularly because the groups are likely to be more negative than Mr. Spitzer\u2019s Democratic primary opponent, Scott M. Stringer, the Manhattan borough president.         \n\nTaking a cue from the changing landscape of presidential politics, the groups are forming two \u201c \n\u201d that will be free to accept contributions of any size, unhindered by the restrictions that limit gifts to Mr. Stringer\u2019s campaign.         \n\nWith just six weeks to go before the\u00a0Sept. 10\u00a0primary, the creation of the two groups underscores the urgent trepidation with which these groups now regard Mr. Spitzer. Mr. Spitzer, who worked in television after resigning as governor, has benefited from enormous coverage in the news media and multiple appearances on late-night television since his campaign began; he has led Mr. Stringer in recent public polls, and a majority of New Yorkers now say that his past foibles do not disqualify him from running for office.         \n\nThe separate groups plan to begin their campaigns\u00a0on Tuesday, with the labor-dominated group planning a radio ad aimed at encouraging Latino voters to back Mr. Stringer.         \n\nWhen asked about the debut of the groups, Hari Sevugan, a spokesman for Mr. Spitzer\u2019s campaign, said: \u201cEliot Spitzer has spent his career taking on powerful interests on behalf of working New Yorkers. So it\u2019s not surprising, now, that some of the same moneyed interests he challenged and the political establishment he rankled are nervously scrambling to prop up his opponent.\u201d         \n\nOne of the new super PACs \u2014  \n, the coalition of business and women\u2019s groups \u2014 is being advised by Bradley Tusk, the manager of the 2009 re-election campaign of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. Mr. Bloomberg has been sharply critical of Mr. Spitzer\u2019s behavior toward Wall Street. The group hopes to raise $1 million, and the rhetoric on its Web site is sharply anti-Spitzer.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of concern that Spitzer as comptroller is just a prelude to Spitzer running for mayor, and no one invested in the city\u2019s future wants that,\u201d Mr. Tusk said in an interview.         \n\nSome members of ForwardNY compare Mr. Spitzer, whose resignation was prompted when his patronizing of prostitutes became public, to a Democratic mayoral candidate, Anthony D. Weiner, who resigned from Congress when his habit of sending sexually explicit e-mails and photographs to women he knew only online became public.         \n\nSonia Ossorio, president of the New York City chapter of the National Organization for Women, said that her members were enthusiastic about joining ForwardNY, because \u201cI think everybody wants to leave these tawdry scandals behind and move on with the serious business of electing a whole slew of new people into office and making sure they do a good job.\u201d         \n\nThe other new group, Progress NYC, is a coalition of the city\u2019s four most politically potent labor unions, representing health care workers (Local 1199 of the Service Employees International Union), building employees (Local 32BJ of the S.E.I.U.), hotel workers (the Hotel Trades Council) and teachers (the United Federation of Teachers).         \n\nThe unions failed in their effort to coalesce behind one candidate for mayor. But they are united in their desire to help Mr. Stringer, who has been a longtime ally of labor, both as borough president and as an assemblyman. They plan to spend at least $500,000.         \n\n\u201cUnions are putting their money and muscle behind Stringer because he is the progressive candidate with a real record of delivering for working families across the entire city,\u201d said Dan Morris, a spokesman for Progress NYC. \u201cBoosting Stringer\u2019s appeal among crucial constituencies like outer-borough Latinos is a recipe for victory.\u201d         \n\nThe focus on Latinos represents a calculation that those voters remain undecided. Mr. Spitzer has a strong lead among African-Americans, another key Democratic constituency; a recent Quinnipiac University survey found that blacks who identified themselves as Democrats likely to vote in September preferred Mr. Spitzer by two to one.
