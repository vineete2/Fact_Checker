{"headline": "Sure-Footed Real Salt Lake Reaches M.L.S. Final", "body": "\nPORTLAND, Ore. \u2014 Real Salt Lake\u2019s players and coaches climbed atop a small makeshift stage at midfield for a trophy celebration after dispatching the Portland Timbers in Sunday\u2019s M.L.S. Western Conference final. A machine sprayed red confetti in the air.         \n\nThe scene must have made for good television. But from high above Jeld-Wen Field, up in the rafters on a cool, clear night, it was easier to grasp Real Salt Lake\u2019s achievement. The 20,000 fans who had packed the stands continued to chant and cheer for the Timbers (\u201cP-T-F-C!\u201d), refusing to leave after their team\u2019s second home loss all season. Real Salt Lake popped Champagne amid it all.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think home-field advantage is as big as everyone thinks for a championship game,\u201d Salt Lake\u2019s midfielder Ned Grabavoy said.         \n\nWell, certainly not for championship teams. Few franchises in Major League Soccer have been more consistent than Real Salt Lake. With six consecutive postseason appearances, including a run to the M.L.S. Cup title in 2009, the franchise has set standards for excellence \u2014 if not for riveting play.         \n\nTrue to form, Real Salt Lake held to a businesslike approach against the Timbers. After Robbie Findley scored the game\u2019s only goal in the 29th minute, Real Salt Lake protected its 5-2 aggregate lead in the two-game series by playing keep-away from the Timbers, the conference\u2019s top seed. It was what Real Salt Lake needed to do with a three-goal advantage: no flashy passes, no tactical breakdowns on defense, no problems.         \n\n\u201cIn my honest opinion, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not everybody\u2019s, this team deserves more trophies than it has,\u201d said Jason Kreis, the coach of Real Salt Lake, which will play Sporting Kansas City for the M.L.S. championship Dec. 7. Sporting K.C., which beat Houston, 2-1, on Saturday to win the Eastern Conference title, will host the final.         \n\nIn the process, Real Salt Lake continued to dominate Portland, extending its unbeaten streak to 10 games. Kreis and his players were at a loss to explain it, other than to say that they have developed a knack for executing in critical situations. \u201cWe knew it was going to take a lot of focus and effort,\u201d midfielder Kyle Beckerman said.         \n\nReal Salt Lake withstood considerable pressure at the start of the match, both from the Timbers, who knew they needed to attack to overcome a two-goal deficit from the first leg, and from the Portland fans, who have established themselves as among the more passionate in American sports. The partisans sang and chanted. They waved flags and hurled invective, most of it directed at the officials, who had a role in some early drama.         \n\nThey twice waved off goals by the Timbers: the first for a foul in the penalty area after Portland had appeared to score off a corner kick, and the second after Mamadou Danso was (correctly) ruled offside as he turned the ball into the net just after Real Salt Lake had taken the lead. In any case, it was clear that Portland was controlling possession.         \n\n\u201cIt certainly had me nervous for long stretches,\u201d Kreis said.         \n\nHe knew it was a perilous situation. Had the Timbers scored first, they would have seized momentum \u2014 all of it \u2014 and on their home field, no less. The match would probably have had a different feel, Kreis said, in a diplomatic way of suggesting that things might have gone poorly for his side.         \n\nAt the very least, Kreis could take comfort in knowing he had a roster packed with players who were experienced, who had thrived in demanding situations and who understood one another\u2019s strengths and weaknesses. He cited the midfielders Javier Morales, Beckerman and Grabavoy, teammates for five seasons; Nat Borchers, a no-nonsense defender who anchored the back line; and Nick Rimando, the team\u2019s 34-year-old goalkeeper.         \n\n\u201cI think they\u2019ve been through every scenario possible,\u201d Kreis said.         \n\nHe added, \u201cWe have so many players who have been in this system for so long and played together for so long that I think they just have an innate sense of where they need to be at all times.\u201d         \n\nAnd, of course, there was Findley, a forward who rejoined the team this season after a two-year adventure in Europe. He collected only six goals in 25 regular-season appearances, but Kreis said he always sensed that Findley had something special in reserve.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said it all year long: We brought Robbie Findley back because he\u2019s capable of scoring the goal in the biggest moments,\u201d Kreis said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had forwards over the past couple of years that, frankly, scored the goals in the soft games but not necessarily when all the chips are down.\u201d         \n\nSure enough, Findley was there to pounce after his teammate Luis Gil ripped a shot that Timbers goalkeeper Donovan Ricketts was unable to field cleanly. Findley knocked the rebound into the goal, draining the life from the stadium. Kreis said he could sense that Portland\u2019s frustration was mounting.         \n\nIt was desperation versus discipline in the second half, as Real Salt Lake stuck to its plan. Portland did everything it could to summon one last push, including the deployment of Timber Joey, the team\u2019s chainsaw-wielding mascot. Nothing, though, could shake Real Salt Lake, now one win from another title.
