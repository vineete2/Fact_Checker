{"headline": "As It Denounces U.S. Spying, Europe Delays Privacy Protection at Home", "body": "\nBRUSSELS \u2014 Even with Europe in an uproar over intrusive United States surveillance, its leaders are looking for ways to slow down legislation aimed at preventing violations of privacy at home.         \n\nTwo days after Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany telephoned President Obama to complain about the monitoring of her cellphone by the United States, she joined fellow European leaders at a summit meeting in Brussels last week in agreeing not to rush into a new data privacy law, perhaps putting it off until 2015, after elections next May for a new European Parliament.         \n\nKicking decisions into the future is a permanent feature of Europe\u2019s cumbersome decision-making process. But Germany\u2019s acquiescence in a British-led effort to freeze the privacy measures highlighted what appear to be contradictions between the verbal support for privacy among European leaders and their own policy decisions.         \n\n\u201cEveryone is very eager to protect privacy in their public statements,\u201d said Miriam Artino, a policy analyst at La Quadrature du Net, a French organization that promotes digital rights and liberties. \u201cBut we can see that government leaders are not very enthusiastic and are looking for ways to delay the process.\u201d         \n\nThe disclosures of the National Security Agency\u2019s activities by a former contractor for it, Edward J. Snowden, have set off a fierce debate on both sides of the Atlantic about the proper balance between privacy and economic, security and other interests.         \n\nIn an effort to control the damage, the Obama administration indicated on Monday that it was  \n of friendly foreign leaders. Ms. Merkel stayed silent about the shift, but officials in Berlin welcomed what apparently was a realization that American economic interests, too, could be harmed if the monitoring persisted.         \n\n\u201cThe Americans know by now that this affair is very damaging to their own interests, which is evident in the reaction of the president, as well as the Senate,\u201d the interior minister, Hans-Peter Friedrich, told Germany\u2019s N-TV news channel.         \n\nBut increasingly, it has damaged the standing of European politicians as well, as they seek to play down the role their own security services have played in secret surveillance.         \n\nBritain\u2019s intelligence service is long known to have cooperated closely with the N.S.A., carrying out surveillance on behalf of the United States. The director of the N.S.A., Gen. Keith B. Alexander, testified on Tuesday before Congress that reports that his agency had collected the phone records of millions of Europeans were \u201ccompletely false.\u201d         \n\nApparently referring to recent reports of extensive phone surveillance in France and Spain by the N.S.A., he said European intelligence services had themselves collected phone records in war zones and other areas outside their borders and shared them with the United States.         \n\nEurope\u2019s involvement in the spying game was given further credence by a former foreign minister of Greece, Theodoros Pangalos, who told a Greek radio station that his country\u2019s intelligence services had  \n of American ambassadors to Greece and Turkey in the 1990s, The Associated Press reported.         \n\nIn addition to what seemed to be the leaders\u2019 reluctance to rein in too sharply activities countenanced by their own spy agencies, Europe\u2019s slow-track approach to tightening the rules on privacy protection has faced a host of other hurdles.         \n\nThe proposed legislation in the European Parliament met with fierce opposition from business groups in the United States and Europe. There were also concerns that the issue would complicate negotiations on a wide-ranging trade agreement between Europe and the United States, a pact that many European leaders champion as an important lever to help lift Europe\u2019s sluggish economic growth.         \n\nMany members of the current Parliament and officials at the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive arm, had wanted to push the law through before next summer. Jan Philipp Albrecht, a German Parliament member who is in the vanguard of that push, said the summit meeting decision showed that Germany, the bloc\u2019s weightiest economic and political power, had been eclipsed by other nations in protecting privacy.
