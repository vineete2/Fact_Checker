{"headline": "A Lesson in Perseverance for a Giants Running Back", "body": "\nShrouded in darkness, Michael A. Cox Sr., a plainclothes Boston police officer, sprinted after four murder suspects cornered on a dead-end street in a seedy neighborhood. As sirens wailed nearby, one of the suspects scaled a fence, with Cox in close pursuit.         \n\nBut then Cox was attacked from behind, slammed in the head and knocked to the ground \u2014 and into unconsciousness \u2014 with a flurry of police officers\u2019 fists, batons and boot-laden feet. His colleagues on the force, both white and black, did not realize that Cox, who is black, was an officer until they saw his badge beneath the parka covering his crumpled body.         \n\nThe 1995 case was a flash point in Boston, one of the most notorious incidents of police brutality in a city with a troubled history of race relations. A cover-up began quickly \u2014 officers initially claimed Cox, a member of the anti-gang unit, slipped on ice. Even after multiple investigations, no one was ever convicted of the attack, which became known as Boston\u2019s Rodney King case.         \n\nThe episode is still felt sharply more than 200 miles away in a surprising place: the  \n\u2019 backfield.         \n\nMichael Cox, a 25-year-old rookie running back, is the eldest child of Michael Cox Sr., the officer who spent months recovering from serious injuries to his head and torso.         \n\nThe father and son have almost never spoken publicly about what happened that night, and Michael Sr. and his wife, Kimberly, have rarely discussed it with their three children.         \n\nBut Michael Jr. said the attack, which happened when he was only 6, partly shaped his life.         \n\n\u201cAnything can happen at any time,\u201d Michael Jr. said Monday, his first time speaking to a reporter about his father\u2019s assault. \u201cYou have to be ready, and you have to push through things. My father went through a lot of things he shouldn\u2019t have had to go through, but it didn\u2019t stop him. I was taught that you decide who wins in that case.\u201d         \n\nMichael Cox Sr., who remained with the Boston police and is now a deputy superintendent, has rarely discussed the case outside court proceedings. Since grade school, Michael Jr., sent to a Connecticut prep school and going on to play at Michigan and Massachusetts, has been toiling in anonymity, his coaches and teammates mostly unaware of his father\u2019s past, just as his father preferred it. But Cox Sr. knew that the chance of people connecting the dots was always possible.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent my entire life since that night trying to make sure it didn\u2019t have an effect on my children,\u201d Cox said in a telephone interview from his Boston home Wednesday. \u201cSometimes in life, bad things happen to you. There\u2019s no reason for that to take over the lives of your children.\u201d         \n\nMichael Jr. has taken those cues from his father, whom he has never asked about the beating.         \n\n\u201cI learned from just watching him,\u201d said Michael Jr., who is soft-spoken and conspicuously quiet in a boisterous Giants locker room. \u201cHe treated it as something unfortunate that he had to overcome. And he would.\u201d         \n\nBut it also meant that Michael, by the time he was 10, would see his name in newspaper headlines.         \n\n\u201cIt was a little crazy, my friends at school would be saying, \u2018Hey, your dad is in the paper again today,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d just say, \u2018He got hurt on the job.\u2019 In our house, that\u2019s all that was ever said.\u201d         \n\nBut it was impossible for Michael Sr. to keep his family entirely untouched by such a charged episode.         \n\nBefore Michael Jr. began playing organized football at 16, he was an ice hockey star. His father tried to keep him away from the game because of the absence of diversity on the ice, but Michael Jr. eventually was granted permission to play. But the notoriety of his father\u2019s assault accompanied him.         \n\n\u201cPeople knew who I was,\u201d Michael Jr. said. \u201cI loved playing ice hockey, but there was a lot of racism. It was obvious when you\u2019re the only black kid out there. And maybe the other stuff had something to do with it, too.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/sports/football/a-lesson-in-perseverance-for-giants-running-back.html", "date": "2013-11-16", "description": "The rookie running back Michael Cox learned how to deal with adversity after watching his father, a police officer, endure a brutal beating at the hands of fellow officers in 1995."}
