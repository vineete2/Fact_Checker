{"headline": "And Then Steve Said, \u2018Let There Be an iPhone\u2019", "body": "\nThe 55 miles from Campbell to San Francisco make for one of the nicest commutes anywhere. The journey mostly zips along the Junipero Serra Freeway, a grand and remarkably empty highway that abuts the east side of the Santa Cruz Mountains. It is one of the best places in Silicon Valley to spot a start-up tycoon speed-testing his Ferrari and one of the worst places for cellphone reception. For Andy Grignon, it was therefore the perfect place for him to be alone with his thoughts early on Jan. 8, 2007.         \n\nThis wasn\u2019t Grignon\u2019s typical route to work. He was a senior engineer at  \n in Cupertino, the town just west of Campbell. His morning drive typically covered seven miles and took exactly 15 minutes. But today was different. He was going to watch his boss, Steve Jobs, make history at the Macworld trade show in San Francisco. Apple fans had for years begged Jobs to put a cellphone inside their iPods so they could stop carrying two devices in their pockets. Jobs was about to fulfill that wish. Grignon and some colleagues would spend the night at a nearby hotel, and around 10 a.m. the following day they \u2014 along with the rest of the world \u2014 would watch Jobs unveil the first iPhone.         \n\nBut as Grignon drove north, he didn\u2019t feel excited. He felt terrified. Most onstage product demonstrations in Silicon Valley are canned. The thinking goes, why let bad Internet or cellphone connections ruin an otherwise good presentation? But Jobs insisted on live presentations. It was one of the things that made them so captivating. Part of his legend was that noticeable product-demo glitches almost never happened. But for those in the background, like Grignon, few parts of the job caused more stress.         \n\nGrignon was the senior manager in charge of all the radios in the iPhone. This is a big job. Cellphones do innumerable useful things for us today, but at their most basic, they are fancy two-way radios. Grignon was in charge of the equipment that allowed the phone to be a phone. If the device didn\u2019t make calls, or didn\u2019t connect with Bluetooth headsets or Wi-Fi setups, Grignon had to answer for it. As one of the iPhone\u2019s earliest engineers, he\u2019d dedicated two and a half years of his life \u2014 often seven days a week \u2014 to the project.         \n\nGrignon had been part of the iPhone rehearsal team at Apple and later at the presentation site in San Francisco\u2019s Moscone Center. He had rarely seen Jobs make it all the way through his 90-minute show without a glitch. Jobs had been practicing for five days, yet even on the last day of rehearsals the iPhone was still randomly dropping calls, losing its Internet connection, freezing or simply shutting down.         \n\n\u201cAt first it was just really cool to be at rehearsals at all \u2014 kind of like a cred badge,\u201d Grignon says. Only a chosen few were allowed to attend. \u201cBut it quickly got really uncomfortable. Very rarely did I see him become completely unglued \u2014 it happened, but mostly he just looked at you and very directly said in a very loud and stern voice, \u2018You are [expletive] up my company,\u2019 or, \u2018If we fail, it will be because of you.\u2019 He was just very intense. And you would always feel an inch tall.\u201d Grignon, like everyone else at rehearsals, knew that if those glitches showed up during the real presentation, Jobs would not be blaming himself for the problems. \u201cIt felt like we\u2019d gone through the demo a hundred times, and each time something went wrong,\u201d Grignon says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a good feeling.\u201d         \n\nThe preparations were top-secret. From Thursday through the end of the following week, Apple completely took over Moscone. Backstage, it built an eight-by-eight-foot electronics lab to house and test the iPhones. Next to that it built a greenroom with a sofa for Jobs. Then it posted more than a dozen security guards 24 hours a day in front of those rooms and at doors throughout the building. No one got in without having his or her ID electronically checked and compared with a master list that Jobs had personally approved. The auditorium where Jobs was rehearsing was off limits to all but a small group of executives. Jobs was so obsessed with leaks that he tried to have all the contractors Apple hired \u2014 from people manning booths and doing demos to those responsible for lighting and sound \u2014 sleep in the building the night before his presentation. Aides talked him out of it.
