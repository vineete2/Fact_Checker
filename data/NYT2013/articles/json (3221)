{"headline": "Road to Morocco Stops in Yonkers", "body": "\nYONKERS \u2014 It is sometimes said that if you go to the makeshift Jewish museum in the medina of Fez, Morocco, and quietly ask the custodian there if he has any mahia, you might get lucky. Then again, you could simply turn to a married couple in downtown Yonkers.         \n\nMahia, the traditional eau de vie, or schnapps, of Morocco, is made from dried figs, unlike the European spirits made from fresh fruit. And it is traditionally distilled by Jews like David Nahmias, a Moroccan expatriate who with his wife, Dorit, makes and markets his own under the brand  \n.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in my blood,\u201d Mr. Nahmias said while sitting in their distillery under a photomontage featuring the Lubavitcher Rebbe and the King of Morocco. \u201cI always had this idea in my head to make it. My wife thought I was crazy. Everyone thought I was crazy.\u201d         \n\nHistorically, Jews have been important spirits artisans in Morocco, where the Muslim majority is discouraged from drinking. For more than a century, the Nahmias family commanded respect in their village, Taznakht, for their high-quality mahia. \u201cMy parents made it daily, except Shabbat,\u201d Mr. Nahmias said. \u201cMy very first memory was the smell of fermenting figs.\u201d         \n\nThe family\u2019s distillery was a meeting place both for Jews and for imbibing Muslims who stopped by to make purchases. Their mahia (the name, like eau de vie, means water of life) was knocked back at holiday and family gatherings. And it was used as folk medicine in an area without any hospitals: for earaches, it was given through a dropper.         \n\nMr. Nahmias, 52, emigrated in the mid-1970s, attending high school in Paris and college in Montreal before working in software development in New York. His wife said that ever since they met 18 years ago, he longed to take his place as a third-generation distiller, but that her need for security, especially with two children to raise and educate, held them back.         \n\nThen in 2009, when she lost her job and his parents died, the moment arrived to take a chance. \u201cFor one thing,\u201d Mr. Nahmias said, \u201cmy wife listened to me.\u201d         \n\nIt helped that these life passages coincided with the explosion in the craft spirit craze, and that mahia was largely unexplored in the United States.         \n\nThe couple had already distilled in their kitchen. They swapped their small alembic pot still for a huge, gleaming four-copper-plate pot still from Germany that cost $100,000. They rented space in a dingy Yonkers industrial park. To market the product, Ms. Nahmias hit the road in the fall of 2012, landing early clients like  \n,  \n, and  \n.         \n\nTheir mahia, which is certified kosher, starts with a grab bag of different varieties of California dried figs. Five pounds are needed for each 750-milliliter bottle.         \n\nThe couple smash the fruit three times in a crusher. The mash is rehydrated with purified water, and kosher yeast is added for fermentation. No other additives or enzymes are used, except for a touch of fresh anise seed. After two weeks, the finished fruit wine heads to the still.         \n\nThe result is a dry, fragrant spirit that is as strong as slivovitz, the Eastern European plum brandy, but smoother by far. The taste is intensely figgy, and the anise is so delicate it is almost like a ghost sighting, more aromatically potent in the empty glass than in the mouth.         \n\nYou\u2019re unlikely to find mahia of this quality in North Africa, Mr. Nahmias said. \u201cToday it\u2019s often loaded with added sugar.\u201d         \n\nYana Wolfson, the beverage director of Peels, on the Bowery, made a Moroccan Sidecar with it last year and now offers Nahmias mahia in lieu of grappa. \u201cIt\u2019s just as powerful, yet more flavorful and very unctuous,\u201d Ms. Wolfson said.         \n\nThe couple also make a rye whiskey called Legs Diamond, and a promising Calvados is in development. No word yet on how they work for earaches.
