{"headline": "Egypt\u2019s Birthrate Rises as Population Control Policies Vanish", "body": "\nCAIRO \u2014 More than two years after the Egyptian uprising, the country\u2019s new Islamist government has struggled to confront a  \n and the faltering  \n. But the leadership has remained silent about another crucial indicator that has surged to a 20-year high: the country\u2019s birthrate.         \n\nIn fact, officials have avoided public discussion about population and dropped the awareness campaigns of the past, in an early indication of how the Islamist leadership is approaching social policy in the most populous Arab state.         \n\nAfter two decades of steady declines and modest increases, the birthrate in 2012 reached about 32 for every 1,000 people \u2014 surpassing a level last seen in 1991, shortly before the government of the longtime president,  \n, expanded family planning programs and publicity campaigns to curtail population growth that he blamed for crippling  \n\u2019s development. Last year, there were 2.6 million births, bringing the population to about 84 million, according to preliminary government figures.         \n\nThe new government of President  \n has continued financing for family planning programs. But health officials have taken a starkly different view of climbing birthrates, presenting the problem as one of economic management \u2014 not the size of the population. Population experts are increasingly alarmed by the government\u2019s silence and its lack of focus on the issue.         \n\n\u201cThe birthrate is important. It is not right to ignore the population problem,\u201d said Hassan Zaky, a demographer who teaches at Cairo University and the American University in Cairo. \u201cBefore, there was a clear policy. Now, we don\u2019t know where we are going. We don\u2019t know the view of the state.\u201d         \n\nGovernment officials blame Egypt\u2019s chaotic transition for the lack of public discourse. But the shift in priorities also reflects a longstanding critique by Islamists of Mr. Mubarak\u2019s population policies. For decades, the  \n and ultraconservatives chafed at Mr. Mubarak\u2019s almost single-minded focus on  \n and two-child families as a core component of public policy. Mr. Mubarak used family planning \u2014 a foreign imposition \u2014 to mask the government\u2019s failed strategies, some Islamists said.         \n\n\u201cThe real problem is with us, as an administration,\u201d said Hamid al-Daly, a representative of the ultraconservative Nour Party and a member of the health committee in Egypt\u2019s upper house of Parliament. \u201cThe population in China is over a billion, but there is good management and good utilization of resources. The population is a blessing if we use it well, and a curse if we mismanage the crisis.\u201d         \n\nMany public health workers agree that Mr. Mubarak\u2019s approach, which was backed by international aid donors, was never a solution on its own. But they said the current government\u2019s silence on the population threatens only to make the situation worse.         \n\n\u201cNo one is saying we should concentrate only on family planning, or only on development,\u201d Mr. Zaky said. \u201cWe need a mix. We don\u2019t want the new regime to focus on one thing.\u201d         \n\nOver decades, Egypt\u2019s climbing birthrates have helped choke its cities. Fertile land along the Nile disappeared under new buildings, as Egyptians crowded ever more tightly together on the tiny percentage of the country that the government bothered to develop. Egyptians chastised their leaders with taunts that illustrated the crisis: While presidents dressed in the latest fashions, \u201cwe live seven to a room,\u201d a chant went.         \n\nThe state\u2019s formal role in family planning began in the 1960s under President Gamal Abdel Nasser. In the late 1970s, the United States Agency for International Development became the main supporter of family planning programs in Egypt, spending about $1.5 billion on population and other health programs over several decades. Efforts to rein in the birthrate intensified after 1994, when Egypt hosted an international conference on population and development.         \n\nThousands of primary clinics were built around the country, providing family planning and other health services that were credited with decreasing the fertility rate as well as maternal and  \n rates. The outreach efforts of that period included advertisements on state television and banners on Cairo streets \u2014 with slogans like, \u201cBefore you have another baby, secure its needs.\u201d         \n\nDr. Nahla Abdel-Tawab, the Egypt director of the nonprofit Population Council, said of the Mubarak years: \u201cThe president himself used to talk about population increases. It was in the newspapers, in the prime minister\u2019s speeches.\u201d         \n\nNow, population has seemed to vanish from public discussion. Health workers said they were stunned when Dr. Abeer Barakat, an assistant minister for health who is responsible for family planning, made no explicit mention at a United Nations conference in December of population or family planning in describing the Health Ministry\u2019s priorities.         \n\nIn an interview on Thursday, Dr. Barakat said she had simply been trying to inject balance into the debate about population and planning, to reflect the new government\u2019s priorities. \u201cWhat was shocking for them was that I talked about family health, and family planning as part of family health,\u201d she said.         \n\nDr. Barakat, a former official in the Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s political wing before joining the Health Ministry, said she was seeking to redress imbalances in the previous government\u2019s approach to health care. Mr. Mubarak, she said, \u201cwas biased\u201d toward family planning and ignored urgent concerns like  \n and  \n C.
