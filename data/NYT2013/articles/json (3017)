{"headline": "Investigators Dig for Roots of Bomb Suspects\u2019 Radicalization", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The two men suspected in the  \n bombings were armed with a small arsenal of guns, ammunition and explosives when they first confronted the police early Friday, and were most likely planning more attacks, the authorities said Sunday.         \n\nUnited States officials said they were increasingly certain that the two suspects had acted on their own, but were looking for any hints that someone had trained or inspired them. The F.B.I. is broadening its global investigation in search of a motive and pressing the Russian government for more details about a Russian request to the F.B.I. in 2011 about one of the suspects\u2019 possible links to extremist groups, a senior United States official said Sunday.         \n\nNew details about the suspects, their alleged plot and the widening inquiry emerged on Sunday, including the types of weapons that were used and the bomb design\u2019s link to a terrorist manual. Lawmakers also accused the F.B.I. of an intelligence failure, questioning whether the bureau had responded forcefully enough to Russia\u2019s warnings.         \n\nThe White House said Monday that the surviving suspect, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, would not be tried as an enemy combatant. \u201cWe will prosecute this terrorist through our civilian system of justice,\u201d said Jay Carney, the White House press secretary.         \n\nMr. Carney noted that it was illegal to try an American citizen in a military commission, and that a number of high-profile terrorism cases were handled in the civilian court system, including that of the would-be bomber who tried to bring down a passenger jet around Christmas 2009 with explosives in his underwear.         \n\nMr. Carney said the government had gotten \u201cvaluable intelligence\u201d from suspects kept in the civilian judicial process. \u201cThe system has repeatedly proven it can handle\u201d such cases, he said.         \n\nMr. Tsarnaev, 19, remained in a Boston hospital in serious condition. The authorities said they believed that he had tried to kill himself, because a gunshot wound to his neck \u201chad the appearance of a close-range, self-inflicted style,\u201d the senior United States official said.         \n\nAs investigators intensified their search for clues, the investigation\u2019s focus shifted in the last two days from a manhunt that relied heavily on cutting-edge surveillance technology to help track down the suspects to more traditional investigative methods. Those approaches include interviews with friends, relatives and others who knew the suspects and examinations of computers, phones, writings and their possessions.         \n\nMore details of what the authorities said was the original plot were becoming clearer. The Boston police commissioner, Edward Davis, said the authorities believed that Mr. Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan, 26, had planned more attacks beyond the bombings at the finish line of the Boston Marathon, which killed three people and wounded more than 170. When the suspects seized a Mercedes-Benz sport utility vehicle and held the driver hostage, they told him that they planned to head to New York, the senior United States official said Sunday.         \n\nIt was not clear whether the suspects had told the driver what they planned to do there.         \n\nMr. Davis told CBS News\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday: \u201cWe have reason to believe, based upon the evidence that was found at that scene \u2014 the explosions, the explosive ordnance that was unexploded and the firepower that they had \u2014 that they were going to attack other individuals.\u201d         \n\nAlong with determining that the suspects had made at least five pipe bombs, the authorities recovered four firearms that they believe the suspects used, according to a law enforcement official. The authorities found an M-4 carbine rifle \u2014 a weapon similar to ones used by American forces in Afghanistan \u2014 on the boat where the younger suspect was found Friday night in Watertown, Mass.         \n\nTwo handguns and a BB gun that the authorities believe the brothers used in an earlier shootout with officers in Watertown were also recovered, said one official briefed on the investigation. The authorities said they believe the suspects had fired roughly 80 rounds in that shootout, in which Tamerlan Tsarnaev was fatally wounded, the official said.
