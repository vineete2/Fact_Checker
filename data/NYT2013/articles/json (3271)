{"headline": "In Bus Drivers\u2019 Strike, a Windfall for Livery Cabs", "body": "\nJonathan Diaz, a dispatcher at Brooklyn Car Service, hovered over a blinking computer screen in his pint-size office and fielded calls from a swarm of 8 a.m. regulars. There was a Clinton Hill apartment dweller needing a ride to a dialysis center across the borough, a harried young professional late for an office job in SoHo and a cranky traveler seeking swift transport to La Guardia Airport.         \n\nAnd then there were the parents, calling in rapid succession. One wanted a quick ride to  \n in Williamsburg, another to the  \n in East Williamsburg. Yet another was heading to  \n in Bedford-Stuyvesant.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been crazy,\u201d said Mr. Diaz, an even-keeled 19-year-old, before whispering at a peeved passenger into the mouthpiece of his phone: \u201cTwo more minutes, two more minutes.\u201d         \n\nThe New York City school bus strike, now in its second week, has been unsparing in its misery,  \n; to the bus companies who cannot earn money for their routes; to the drivers marching on picket lines in freezing weather. But if there have been any winners, they might be the livery cab companies and drivers who, along with subways and buses, have become the de facto transportation system for more than 100,000 children.         \n\nAt Brooklyn Car Service in Williamsburg, for example, Mr. Diaz and his co-workers said that since the strike began, they had experienced a 40 percent increase in weekday morning calls.         \n\nA few miles away, at Myrtle Car Service, dispatchers have recorded a 14 percent to 29 percent increase in weekday business, with calls reaching close to 1,800 one day last week. Drivers at Sunnyside Car Service reported a 10 percent increase.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been very busy,\u201d said Manuel Peralta, a driver for Family Car Service in Park Slope, Brooklyn, chatting from behind the wheel of his 2005 Lincoln Town Car. Mr. Peralta, 54, says that since the strike, his take-home pay had risen to $250 a day, from $150.         \n\nIn a typical week, he said, he picks up one or two students \u201cbecause they\u2019re late.\u201d On Tuesday alone, he shuttled three students and their parents to school, including one who headed to the Upper East Side, a $40 fare. And in the afternoon, he drove one student home. By Wednesday morning, he was already cultivating new regular customers, parents requesting his car for their now routine jaunts to school.         \n\nLeroy Wallace, a driver for Myrtle Car Service, said his take-home pay had increased by $50 to $60 a day, as he shuttled students and parents in his 2007 black Cadillac from Downtown Brooklyn to as far away as Bayside, Queens. And while Mr. Wallace, who normally takes home $175 on a \u201clucky day,\u201d said he had considerable empathy for distressed parents, he was not complaining. \u201cI thank God for the money,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe city\u2019s  \n  \n taxi or livery cab fare for students who normally are picked up by buses at their door (generally, special education students), and for children as old as sixth graders who live where public transportation to their school \u201cis not readily available,\u201d though a department spokeswoman said that as long as parents filled out the reimbursement forms, the city would pay them back. Some livery cab companies can bill the city directly for the fares of low-income disabled students whose families cannot pay out of pocket.         \n\nThe department said it was too soon to know how much the city would be paying for alternative transportation, but the cost would be offset by savings from not paying bus companies for routes that were out of commission. About 2,670 of the 7,700 routes were running Thursday morning, mostly those whose drivers are not members of the striking union,  \n. The union is on strike because the city, seeking to save money, is soliciting new bids from bus companies for 1,100 special education routes, but without traditional job protections for current union members. The two sides disagree on whether such protections are legal.         \n\nBecause of its loose structure, the livery cab industry has been able to expand to meet the new demand. Most of the 52,500 drivers work independently, owning their own cars, and pay a weekly fee, typically about $100, to dispatch companies, who then connect them to passengers. In a business where profits can be meager and there are no benefits, news of the uptick has spread, sending more drivers onto the city streets. On a typical morning, about 30 drivers work with Brooklyn Car Service. This week, twice that many were.         \n\n\u201cI thought there\u2019d be business today,\u201d said one driver, Felix Siri, who took his Ford Explorer out Tuesday. He had the time because nothing was happening at his regular job: he is a school bus driver on strike.         \n\nHe drove around his Brooklyn neighborhood until he got a call to do a pickup in front of the Roberto Clemente Plaza in south Williamsburg. The mission: get Damon Marin, a yawning 8-year-old, to his third-grade classroom at Public School 380, about a mile away. \u201cWe\u2019re late,\u201d Damon\u2019s mother, Jasmin, told Mr. Siri as she maneuvered herself into his cab, with Damon and his oversize backpack following.         \n\nOutside his rambling school building Wednesday morning, livery cars abounded. There were black Town Cars and Suburbans and silver Camrys displaying a variety of company decals, pulling up one after the other next to parked cars.         \n\nClimbing out of a Town Car, William Sanchez, a Manhattan construction worker who is the father of an 8-year-old, said he had just paid $7 for the trip.         \n\n\u201cNow when I call and give my address, they know where I want to go,\u201d he said.         \n\nInside one car, a stressed-out dispatcher could be heard ticking off driver identification numbers from the radio: \u201cI need a driver; I need a driver!\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/nyregion/as-new-york-school-bus-drivers-strike-livery-cabs-profit.html", "date": "2013-01-24", "description": "Several livery cab companies in New York have reported an increase in business as students and parents must find new ways to get to school."}
