{"headline": "At Disney Parks, a Bracelet Meant to Build Loyalty (and Sales)", "body": "\nORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 Imagine  \n with no entry turnstiles. Cash? Pass\u00e9: Visitors would wear rubber bracelets encoded with credit card information, snapping up corn dogs and Mickey Mouse ears with a tap of the wrist. Smartphone alerts would signal when it is time to ride Space Mountain without standing in line.         \n\nFantasyland? Hardly. It happens starting this spring.         \n\nDisney in the coming months plans to begin introducing a vacation management system called MyMagic+ that will drastically change the way Disney World visitors \u2014 some 30 million people a year \u2014 do just about everything.         \n\nThe initiative is part of a broader effort, estimated by analysts to cost between $800 million and $1 billion, to make visiting Disney parks less daunting and more amenable to modern consumer behavior. Disney is betting that happier guests will spend more money.         \n\n\u201cIf we can enhance the experience, more people will spend more of their leisure time with us,\u201d said Thomas O. Staggs, chairman of Disney Parks and Resorts.         \n\nThe ambitious plan moves Disney deeper into the hotly debated terrain of personal data collection. Like most major companies, Disney wants to have as much information about its customers\u2019 preferences as it can get, so it can appeal to them more efficiently. The company already collects data to use in future sales campaigns, but parts of MyMagic+ will allow Disney for the first time to track guest behavior in minute detail.         \n\nDid you buy a balloon? What attractions did you ride and when? Did you shake Goofy\u2019s hand, but snub Snow White? If you fully use MyMagic+, databases will be watching, allowing Disney to refine its offerings and customize its marketing messages.         \n\nDisney is aware of potential privacy concerns, especially regarding children. The plan, which comes as the federal government is trying to strengthen online privacy protections, could be troublesome for a company that some consumers worry is already too controlling.         \n\nBut Disney has decided that MyMagic+ is essential. The company must aggressively weave new technology into its parks \u2014 without damaging the sense of nostalgia on which the experience depends \u2014 or risk becoming irrelevant to future generations, Mr. Staggs said. From a business perspective, he added, MyMagic+ could be \u201ctransformational.\u201d         \n\nAside from benefiting Disney\u2019s bottom line, the initiative could alter the global theme parks business. Disney is not the first vacation company to use wristbands equipped with radio frequency identification, or RFID, chips. Great Wolf Resorts, an operator of 11 water parks in North America, has been using them since 2006. But Disney\u2019s global parks operation, which has an estimated 121.4 million admissions a year and generates $12.9 billion in revenue, is so huge that it can greatly influence consumer behavior.         \n\n\u201cWhen Disney makes a move, it moves the culture,\u201d said Steve Brown, chief operating officer for Lo-Q, a British company that provides line management and ticketing systems for theme parks and zoos.         \n\nDisney World guests currently plod through entrance turnstiles, redeeming paper tickets, and then decide what to ride; food and merchandise are bought with cash or credit cards. (Disney hotel key cards can also be used to charge items.) People race to FastPass kiosks, which dispense a limited number of free line-skipping tickets. But gridlock quickly sets in and most people wait. And wait.         \n\nIn contrast, MyMagic+ will allow users of a new Web site and app \u2014 called My Disney Experience \u2014 to preselect three FastPasses before they leave home for rides or V.I.P. seating for parades, fireworks and character meet-and-greets. Orlando-bound guests can also preregister for RFID bracelets. These so-called MagicBands will function as room key, park ticket, FastPass and credit card.         \n\nMagicBands can also be encoded with all sorts of personal details, allowing for more personalized interaction with Disney employees. Before, the employee playing Cinderella could say hello only in a general way. Now \u2014 if parents opt in \u2014 hidden sensors will read MagicBand data, providing information needed for a personalized greeting: \u201cHi, Angie,\u201d the character might say without prompting. \u201cI understand it\u2019s your birthday.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/business/media/at-disney-parks-a-bracelet-meant-to-build-loyalty-and-sales.html", "date": "2013-01-07", "description": "Disney\u2019s coming electronic bracelets will allow its theme park visitors to pay for things as well as guide them to attractions, but the company will gain access to valuable information on its customers."}
