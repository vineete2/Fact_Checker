{"headline": "Facing Russian Threat, Ukraine Halts Plans for Deals with E.U.", "body": "\nMOSCOW \u2014 Under threat of crippling trade sanctions by Russia, Ukraine announced Thursday that it had suspended its plans to sign far-reaching political and trade agreements with the European Union and said it would instead pursue new partnerships with a competing trade bloc of former Soviet states.         \n\nThe decision largely scuttles what had been the European Union\u2019s most important foreign policy initiative: an ambitious effort to draw in former Soviet republics and lock them on a trajectory of changes based on Western political and economic sensibilities. The project, called the Eastern Partnership program, began more than four years ago.         \n\nUkraine\u2019s decision not to sign the agreements at a major conference next week in Vilnius, Lithuania, is a victory for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. He had  \n to derail the plans, which he regarded as a serious threat, an economic version of the West\u2019s effort to build military power by expanding NATO eastward. In September, similar pressure by Russia forced Armenia to abandon its talks with the Europeans.         \n\nEuropean leaders reacted with fury and regret, directed at Kiev and Moscow. \u201cThis is a disappointment not just for the E.U. but, we believe, for the people of Ukraine,\u201d Catherine Ashton, the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, said in a statement. Calling the pact that Ukraine was walking away from \u201cthe most ambitious agreement the E.U. has ever offered to a partner country,\u201d Ms. Ashton suggested the country would suffer financially.         \n\n\u201cIt would have provided a unique opportunity to reverse the recent discouraging trend of decreasing foreign investment,\u201d she said, \u201cand would have given momentum\u201d to negotiations for more financial aid from the International Monetary Fund. Ukraine faces a growing economic crisis, and it is widely expected to need a major aid package soon.         \n\nOthers were more pointed in blaming Russia. \u201cUkraine government suddenly bows deeply to the Kremlin,\u201d the Swedish foreign minister, Carl Bildt, wrote  \n. \u201cPolitics of brutal pressure evidently works.\u201d         \n\nIn Brussels, Stefan Fule, the European Commission\u2019s senior official responsible for relations with neighboring countries, canceled a trip to Ukraine that he had announced just hours earlier, suggesting that officials saw little hope in reversing the decision. \u201cHard to overlook in reasoning for today\u2019s decision impact of #Russia\u2019s recent unjustified economic & trade measures,\u201d he wrote  \n.         \n\nUkraine\u2019s announcement came in the form of a decree issued by the cabinet of ministers ordering the government \u201cto suspend\u201d preparations for concluding the agreements with Europe and instead begin planning for new negotiations with the European Union and Russia.         \n\nAt virtually the same time, President Viktor F. Yanukovich, who was on a visit to Vienna, issued a statement saying, \u201cUkraine has been and will continue to pursue the path to European integration.\u201d         \n\nIn a move emblematic of Ukraine\u2019s often inscrutable politics, Mr. Yanukovich barely acknowledged the developments in Kiev and, responding to a reporter\u2019s question about the pacts with Europe, said, \u201cOf course, there are difficulties on the path.\u201d         \n\nBecause Mr. Yanukovich was supposed to sign the accords in Vilnius, some officials seemed to hold out the faint possibility he might find a way to resurrect the agreements. Those hopes seemed to fade Thursday night as the reactions in Europe grew angrier, and Russia said it would gladly join in negotiations if the accords were postponed.         \n\nThe decree by the cabinet of ministers followed the Ukrainian Parliament\u2019s overwhelming rejection of legislation that would have freed the country\u2019s jailed former prime minister, Yulia V. Tymoshenko, and allowed her to seek treatment in Germany for back problems. Ms. Tymoshenko is a bitter political rival of Mr. Yanukovich\u2019s.         \n\nThe West has long criticized the conviction of Ms. Tymoshenko on abuse of authority charges and her seven-year prison sentence, saying they were a politically motivated effort to sideline her. Her release was widely viewed as a condition of signing the agreements, although the European Union never officially declared it to be a requirement.         \n\nThe Parliament, which is controlled by Mr. Yanukovich\u2019s Party of Regions, defeated six different bills related to the treatment of prisoners that were intended to address Ms. Tymoshenko\u2019s case.         \n\nOpposition leaders in Parliament, including members of Ms. Tymoshenko\u2019s Fatherland party and leaders of the nationalist Svoboda party, accused Mr. Yanukovich of torpedoing Ukraine\u2019s chances for integration with Western Europe.
