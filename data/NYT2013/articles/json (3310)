For decades, the big and small screens have been sprouting stories about beloved balls that have been ruined, usually by a child who has not been properly schooled in the importance of sports memorabilia. And in these tales we can find vital lessons for this time of year.         \n\nYour autographed ball is never in more danger than it is right now. Children, responding to the hoopla surrounding opening day, will be eager to get outside and toss a ball around. For them, any old ball will do, including the ball you have prominently displayed on the mantle. By the time you get home from work, it will be an unrecognizable blob of string and leather.         \n\nBut by studying ball destroyers from television and the movies, we can identify a few steps you can take to make sure your precious memento remains intact.         \n\n \n         \n\nThat is the lesson of  \n first broadcast in April 1960, during the show\u2019s third season. Ward, the Beaver\u2019s father, discovers a prized baseball from his childhood in a trunk and puts it on display in his den, a foolish thing to do given Beaver\u2019s already well-established knack for wreaking havoc.         \n\nHow valuable was this baseball? It had been signed by Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Lefty Grove, Kiki Cuyler, Augie Galan, Bill Dickey and Grover Cleveland Alexander, which means it could have paid for the Beaver\u2019s college education.         \n\nOthers can research whether those players were ever in the same locker room at the same time, as Ward attests. Our focus here is what happens to the ball. The Beaver\u2019s nitwit friend Larry persuades him to play catch with it, Larry heaves it over the Beaver\u2019s head and into the street, and a passing truck squashes it. So if you own a ball with those autographs on it \u2014 or, really, with any one of those autographs on it \u2014 find a roadless place to live. No road, no trucks.         \n\n \n         \n\nIf the community in the  \n had had such a law, the group of boys in the story would have been spared a lot of anxiety. Especially a kid named Smalls, who pilfers his stepfather\u2019s cherished ball, autographed by Babe Ruth, and promptly hits it over the fence and into the lair of a fearsome dog known as the Beast. A significant chunk of the movie involves the boys\u2019 efforts to retrieve the ball without being eaten. When they finally do, it is not exactly in heirloom condition.         \n\n \n         \n\nIt\u2019s the family pet that does the damage in  \n first broadcast in October 2002. The son in the fictional Lopez family, Max, is being pressured by his father to improve his baseball skills, which are abysmal, and he practices with one of George\u2019s most treasured possessions, a ball signed by Steve Garvey, Joe Morgan, Jim Palmer and Rod Carew. The family mutt nabs it and reduces it to a gooey lump.         \n\nThe episode, by the way, features four of the daffiest athlete cameos in television history. Garvey, Morgan, Palmer and Carew appear or, more accurately, their heads do, as George\u2019s bobblehead-doll collection lectures him after he yells at Max.         \n\n \n         \n\nIn an  \n from January 2008, Miley Stewart, the character played by Miley Cyrus, inadvertently sends a ball owned by her brother, Jackson, down the garbage disposal. The player who had signed the ball is fictional, but the back story is interesting. The ball was valuable because the player had hit five home runs in his first five professional at-bats, then sustained a career-ending injury doing a celebratory cartwheel and was so bitter that he never signed anything again. Anyway, the point is, if you stop eating, you won\u2019t need a garbage disposal.         \n\nSo there you have it. You may be lonely and hungry in your remote, dog-free home, but at least your signed ball will be safe. Just don\u2019t watch  \n.         \n\nIn the show, from December 1996, Ray finds out that the signed Mickey Mantle he has been carrying around for 25 years \u2014 the ball, he says, that led him to become a sportswriter \u2014 wasn\u2019t signed by Mantle after all.         \n\n\u201cAll this signed stuff is like 70 percent fake,\u201d a friend tells him early in the episode, planting the seed of doubt that leads Ray to uncover the real story behind his keepsake. \u201cBack then, the trainers would sign all the balls.\u201d         \n\nUh-oh.
