{"headline": "One Man Lost and Impaired, the Other Fearful and Armed", "body": "\nCHICKAMAUGA, Ga. \u2014 Deanne Westbrook had tried everything to keep her husband, Ronald, in the house.         \n\nHe was 72. Alzheimer\u2019s had erased much of his talent for music and flying airplanes.         \n\nNo one is sure how, in the frigid hours before dawn last Wednesday in this small north Georgia community near the Tennessee border, Mr. Westbrook ended up nearly three miles from home with a handful of other people\u2019s mail, jiggling Joe Hendrix\u2019s doorknob.         \n\nMr. Hendrix, 34, stepped onto his porch with a Glock pistol in his hand and his fianc\u00e9e inside on the phone with a 911 dispatcher. He fired four shots. One hit Mr. Westbrook in the chest.         \n\nOn a cold and damp day Tuesday, Mrs. Westbrook buried her husband of 51 years, his death adding another chapter to the debate over the nation\u2019s patchwork of self-defense laws.         \n\n\u201cI understand the man who shot him is real upset, and I think he should be,\u201d Mrs. Westbrook said in an interview. \u201cHe shot an innocent man. He should have stayed in the house like a normal person would.\u201d         \n\nInvestigators and a district attorney are weighing whether to charge Mr. Hendrix, a decision that exposes the challenge of balancing the right to use deadly force to defend oneself with the imperfect reality of snap decisions.         \n\nUnlike a  \n last month in Michigan when a white man shot a young black woman on his porch and the closely followed  \n of Trayvon Martin in Florida last year, this one had no racial overtones. Both men were white.         \n\nThe legal issue revolves around the question of how scared was Mr. Hendrix \u2014 a young man who had just moved into the quiet neighborhood with his fianc\u00e9e \u2014 in those early hours.         \n\nAccording to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and Sheriff\u00a0 \n of Walker County, a sheriff\u2019s deputy first encountered Mr. Westbrook about 2:30 a.m. the day he died.         \n\nIn the confusion that comes from Alzheimer\u2019s, Mr. Westbrook had taken to collecting the mail from neighbors\u2019 mailboxes. He was doing so that night on Marbletop Road, which is a mile or so from his home. He told the deputy he lived in a nearby house, which at one time, years ago, he had.         \n\n\u201cBetter get home,\u201d the deputy said. \u201cIt\u2019s cold.\u201d         \n\nThe deputy drove on, and Mr. Westbrook, in a straw hat and a jacket too light for the weather, continued walking with his dogs.         \n\nJust before 4 a.m., he was nearly three miles from home in the subdivision of modest new houses where Mr. Hendrix lives, near Chattanooga.         \n\nMr. Hendrix, a veteran of the Iraq war who last year served as the spokesman for a Republican candidate for Congress from Tennessee, Scottie Mayfield, did not return calls seeking an interview.         \n\nAt least twice, Mr. Westbrook climbed onto the small porch, tried to open the door and rang the doorbell, Sheriff Wilson said. Dogs were barking. The police were called.         \n\nThe sheriff and Mr. Westbrook had played together in their church\u2019s orchestra. Mr. Westbrook had been a skilled trumpet player, retired from the Air Force as a lieutenant colonel.         \n\nSheriff Wilson said he wished Mr. Hendrix had just stayed inside. But he knows it was a tense situation.         \n\n\u201cWhen you listen to the 911 calls, it\u2019s evident to me that there was fear displayed at least by the female who lived there,\u201d he said.         \n\nAs Mr. Westbrook came around a corner of the house, Mr. Hendrix took his gun and repeatedly called for him to identify himself, he told the police. Then he fired the shots. Mr. Hendrix told investigators that Mr. Westbrook continued to approach him, so he fired the shot into his chest.         \n\nDeputies were six minutes away.         \n\n\u201cWhen we sat down and told him the age of the victim and the diagnosis, he broke down and became emotional,\u201d Sheriff Wilson said.         \n\nWithin two weeks, investigators will meet with Herbert Franklin, the district attorney, to decide if Mr. Hendrix will face charges.         \n\nMr. Franklin is already weighing another so-called Stand Your Ground case. Earlier in November, a 69-year-old man in neighboring Catoosa County came home to find two teenagers trying to break into his house. He shot one in the neck, a 17-year-old boy who died at the hospital.         \n\nIn both cases, Mr. Franklin will be guided by what legal experts call the \u201creasonable person\u201d standard as outlined in the state\u2019s 2006 self-defense law.         \n\n\u201cIn order to use deadly force, you have to reasonably believe you are in imminent danger,\u201d said the Gwinnett County district attorney, Danny Porter. \u201cYou weigh whether the homeowner can show he was in fear of receiving death or great bodily injury.\u201d         \n\nNearly two dozen states have some version of a Stand Your Ground law, and their popularity continues to grow. The Ohio House of Representatives last month approved a bill that, like many, would remove the need for a person to retreat before using deadly force in self-defense.         \n\nGeorgia\u2019s Stand Your Ground law was recently challenged by the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, whose leader, the Rev.  \n, came to the state in early November to announce a lawsuit against Gov. Nathan Deal and the state attorney general.         \n\nCiting two recent cases, Mr. Jackson argued that the state\u2019s law was being unequally applied to whites and blacks.         \n\n\u00a0Mr. Westbrook\u2019s death shows the continuing controversy over the law, even here in a part of the country where gun ownership is treated as a cherished right.         \n\nChris Brown, 50, who lives down the street from the Westbrooks, supports Stand Your Ground laws. He is well-armed and not afraid to pull out a gun if someone broke into his home or tried to steal his truck.         \n\n\u201cBut if he\u2019s out in my yard and I\u2019ve done called the cops, I\u2019m waiting for the cops,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat that guy did wasn\u2019t Stand Your Ground.\u201d         \n\nMr. Westbrook\u2019s widow herself is not sure that Mr. Hendrix should be charged.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what his mind-set was, and I don\u2019t know enough about the law to know,\u201d Mrs. Westbrook said. \u201cBut that\u2019s all over now. His life is already taken. He took the life of a real gentle man, and it\u2019s a crying shame.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/04/us/one-man-lost-and-impaired-the-other-fearful-and-armed.html", "date": "2013-12-03", "description": "A man suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s somehow ended up miles from home, jiggling a couple\u2019s doorknob in the pre-dawn hours, and his shooting death has added another chapter to the debate over self-defense laws."}
