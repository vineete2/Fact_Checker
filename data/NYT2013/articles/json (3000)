{"headline": "As OSHA Emphasizes Safety, Long-Term Health Risks Fester", "body": "\nTAYLORSVILLE, N.C. \u2014 Sheri Farley walks with a limp. The only job she could hold would be one where she does not have to stand or sit longer than 20 minutes, otherwise pain screams down her spine and up her legs.         \n\n\u201cDamaged goods,\u201d Ms. Farley describes herself, recalling how she recently overheard a child whispering to her mother about whether the \u201ccrippled lady\u201d was a meth addict.         \n\nFor about five years, Ms. Farley, 45, stood alongside about a dozen other workers, spray gun in hand, gluing together foam cushions for chairs and couches sold under brand names like Broyhill, Ralph Lauren and Thomasville. Fumes from the glue formed a yellowish fog inside the plant, and Ms. Farley\u2019s doctors say that breathing them in eventually ate away at her nerve endings, resulting in what she and her co-workers call \u201cdead foot.\u201d         \n\nA chemical she handled \u2014 known as n-propyl bromide, or nPB \u2014 is also used by tens of thousands of workers in auto body shops, dry cleaners and high-tech electronics manufacturing plants across the nation. Medical researchers, government officials and even chemical companies that once manufactured nPB have warned for over a decade that it causes neurological damage and infertility when inhaled at low levels over long periods, but its use has grown 15-fold in the past six years.         \n\nSuch hazards demonstrate the difficulty, despite decades of effort, of ensuring that Americans can breathe clean air on the job. Even as worker after worker fell ill, records from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration show that managers at Royale Comfort Seating, where Ms. Farley was employed, repeatedly exposed gluers to nPB levels that exceeded levels federal officials considered safe, failed to provide respirators and turned off fans meant to vent fumes.         \n\nBut the story of the rise of nPB and the decline of Ms. Farley\u2019s health is much more than the tale of one company, or another chapter in the national debate over the need for more, or fewer, government regulations. Instead, it is a parable about the law of unintended consequences.         \n\nIt shows how an Environmental Protection Agency program meant to prevent the use of harmful chemicals fostered the proliferation of one, and how a hard-fought victory by OSHA in controlling one source of deadly fumes led workers to be exposed to something worse \u2014 a phenomenon familiar enough to be lamented in government parlance as \u201cregrettable substitution.\u201d         \n\nIt demonstrates how businesses at once both suffer from and exploit the fitful and disjointed way that the government tries to protect workers, and why occupational illnesses have proved so hard to prevent.         \n\nAnd it highlights a startling fact: OSHA, the watchdog agency that many Americans love to hate and industry often faults as overzealous, has largely ignored long-term threats. Partly out of pragmatism, the agency created by President Richard M. Nixon to give greater attention to health issues has largely done the opposite.         \n\nOSHA devotes most of its budget and attention to responding to here-and-now dangers rather than preventing the silent, slow killers that, in the end, take far more lives. Over the past four decades, the agency has written new standards with exposure limits for 16 of the most deadly workplace hazards, including lead, asbestos and arsenic. But for the tens of thousands of other dangerous substances American workers handle each day, employers are largely left to decide what exposure level is safe.         \n\nBy contrast, OSHA has two dozen pages of regulations just on ladders and stairs.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m the first to admit this is broken,\u201d said David Michaels, the OSHA director, referring to the agency\u2019s record on dealing with workplace health threats. \u201cMeanwhile, tens of thousands of people end up on the gurney.\u201d         \n\nRoyale Comfort Seating disputes that Ms. Farley\u2019s health problems and those of some other workers were linked to their jobs. Company officials also say that while they have sought to safeguard their workers, they have also feared losing jobs to foreign competitors, as many of their industry counterparts in North Carolina have.         \n\nRoyale has not switched away from the nPB glues, managers said, because alternatives did not work well, were sometimes more dangerous and were almost always more expensive.         \n\n\u201cWe, as a company, are also in a tight spot,\u201d said William Lee Isenhour, Royale\u2019s director of personnel and safety.         \n\nChronic ailments caused by toxic workplace air \u2014 black lung, stonecutter\u2019s disease, asbestosis, grinder\u2019s rot, pneumoconiosis \u2014 incapacitate more than 200,000 workers in the United States annually. More than 40,000 Americans die prematurely each year from exposure to toxic substances at work \u2014 10 times as many as those who die from the refinery explosions, mine collapses and other accidents that grab most of the news media attention.         \n\nOccupational illnesses and injuries like Ms. Farley\u2019s cost the American economy roughly $250 billion per year because of medical expenses and lost productivity, according to government data analyzed by J. Paul Leigh, an economist at the University of California, Davis, more than the cost of diabetes or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Roughly 40 percent of medical expenses from workplace hazards, or about $27 billion a year, is paid by public programs like Medicare and Medicaid.         \n\nAnd yet the full price of this epidemic is measured not just in hospital bills and wages lost, but also in the ways, large and small, that life has changed for Ms. Farley and other sickened workers. Glue fumes robbed her of dignity and the joy of small comforts. Her favorite high heels stay in her closet because her feet no longer cooperate. She barks at her 8-year-old daughter, Allie, for hopping around their double-wide trailer because the floor\u2019s vibrations cause intense stinging.         \n\n\u201cI did the work,\u201d Ms. Farley said about her years putting together furniture for America\u2019s households. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t seem a fair price to pay.\u201d         \n\nTwo industries converge in North Carolina along the nine-mile stretch of Interstate 40 between Hickory and Claremont. Foam meets furniture here. Cushions find seats.         \n\nFor nearly a century, towns in these western foothills have been famous for their fine home furnishings, producing roughly half the chairs and tables sold nationwide at the industry\u2019s peak in the 1980s. Every year, several million pounds of a flexible polyurethane foam known as slabstock arrives. It becomes the spongy filling in most of the mattresses, chairs and couches produced in the United States.         \n\nDelivered as huge yellow or pink loaves, often about four feet high and the length of a tractor-trailer, the slabstock is cut into pieces and glued into shapes by rows of workers standing in booths. They sometimes attach upholstery or add a top layer of polyester fiber to give the cushions a softer feel.         \n\nNorth Carolina has been especially affected by globalization and federal regulations. Shifting cultural mores and rising cigarette taxes have cleared hundreds of tobacco farms. Foreign competition has closed most of the textile mills. More than half of the furniture jobs once based here are now gone, according to federal labor data.         \n\nStill, about a thousand people spread across several dozen plants in the state work in this locally vital industry. For Ms. Farley, the job at Royale making cushions represented something rare: a chance for someone with little more than a high school diploma and an ability to stand on her feet all day to make more than $9 an hour.         \n\nDay 1 at the job  \n. Don\u2019t dally, co-workers counseled her; managers keep track of your cushions per hour. Bring a hair dryer; it helps in warming brittle hands in winter when the plant gets frigid. Stock up on aspirin and tissues: the first to survive the headaches from the glue\u2019s gasoline-like fumes; the second because the fumes clear the sinuses.         \n\nAsked about the conditions, Royale officials said their three plants, two here in Taylorsville and one about 15 miles away in Conover, were no worse than others in the business.         \n\nBut no one denied it was dirty, bone-tiring work. During 10-hour shifts, the gluers held spray guns attached to hoses that ran to a humming compressor and 55-gallon drums filled with the glue. Once sprayed, the glue coated everything \u2014 the lights, fans, floors and electrical outlets \u2014 and hung over the workers\u2019 cubicles like a shroud.         \n\n\u201cIt puts the fog in your head,\u201d Ms. Farley said. By the end of a shift, the glue left some workers so dizzy that they walked as if they were drunk. At times, they did not remember driving home.         \n\nCushion-making companies had every reason to like nPB glues. First marketed in the late 1990s, they were inexpensive, strong, fast-drying and, best of all, unregulated.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so safe you can eat it,\u201d glue salesmen in North Carolina told customers, according to federal researchers. Plant operators joked, \u201cAt worst, it\u2019s a cheap high,\u201d an official from an industry trade association recalled. Water-based glues, though safer, dried slower. And retooling a plant to use them could cost anywhere from several thousand dollars to more than $1 million, in some cases doubling a company\u2019s gluing costs.         \n\nFinding a glue that complied with federal rules was a continuing struggle. In the early 1980s, many companies used glue with a chemical called 1,1,1-trichloroethane, or TCA. But the United States and other countries then banned it because it damages the ozone layer, and businesses switched to methylene chloride.         \n\nNicknamed by cushion makers \u201cmethyl ethyl bad stuff,\u201d it killed more than 30 workers a year and sickened thousands more across all industries. OSHA tightened safety limits on the chemical, so companies sought a new option. Before long,  \n of the cushion-making industry had switched to nPB-based glues.         \n\nFor the most part, American employers are left on their own to find substitutes when federal agencies impose new rules on chemicals. But when the government forces the phasing out of one hazardous chemical, it is often replaced by another equally or more dangerous one.         \n\nFrom the start, government officials worried about the safety of nPB, which is also sometimes called 1-bromopropane or 1-BP.         \n\nIn 1999, Adam Finkel, OSHA\u2019s top health officer who had led the agency\u2019s drive to phase out methylene chloride,  \n that nPB was being used as a replacement at levels 10 to 200 times what chemical companies said was safe. Something needed to be done, he said, before the number of people exposed to the new chemical \u201cgrows from the hundreds to the tens of thousands or more.\u201d         \n\nSome companies pulled back. Protonique SA, a Swiss circuit-board maker, banned it for its workers, who used a form of the chemical that was less toxic than that inhaled by Royale workers. \u201cThere is a weight of evidence that should sound warning bells to any thinking person,\u201d the company said in 1999. By 2003, Atofina and Great Lakes, two large chemical companies, had decided they would no longer sell nPB.         \n\nIn the six years after Mr. Finkel wrote his warning letter, federal authorities learned that more than 140 cushion workers nationwide, mostly from plants in Utah, Mississippi and North Carolina, including Royale, had been exposed to dangerous levels of the chemical, many of them sickened and unable to walk.         \n\nCushion makers in the 30,000-employee foam industry were among the most vulnerable of all workers using nPB because they breathed it in aerosol doses. Those employed in other businesses mostly used it in other forms, which pose lower risks, according to scientists, who are finding mounting evidence that nPB is also a carcinogen.         \n\nPinpointing the cause of a worker\u2019s ailment is an inexact science because it is so difficult to rule out the role played by personal habits, toxins in the environment or other factors. But for nearly two decades, most chemical safety scientists have concluded that nPB can cause severe nerve damage when inhaled even at low levels.         \n\nMs. Farley sued Royale for workers\u2019 compensation payments. Her case, along with several other lawsuits related to glue fumes brought by other workers, has been settled.         \n\nWhen news of exposure problems at Royale reached officials at Mid South Adhesives, the maker of the glue that Royale used, they sent an inspector who found that Royale\u2019s Conover plant showed levels at least 10 times what Mid South deemed safe. Mid South officials  \n they could \u201cnot stress enough\u201d the need to provide better protections or to stop using their glue.         \n\nRoyale officials, though, responded that even though they had added fans, had trained workers handling toxic chemicals and planned to put in a new ventilation system, problems persisted.         \n\n\u201cWe tried to use a water-base adhesive, which did not work for us,\u201d a Royale official wrote, adding that the company saw no alternative but to stick with nPB glue.         \n\nOther companies were also reluctant to switch from nPB glues. Officials of the Franklin Corporation, a cushion plant in Houston, Miss., explained in court documents that safety was important but that nPB glues were attractive because they dried so fast that the cushions could be produced in a third of the time.         \n\n\u201cThere are people lined up out there for jobs,\u201d said John Lyles, a vice president at Franklin,  \n by a plant manager in a successful lawsuit in Mississippi brought by four cushion workers who suffered severe nerve damage from the glue. \u201cIf they start dropping like flies, or something in that order, we can replace them today.\u201d         \n\nBusinesses found nPB appealing partly because the E.P.A. had given it an endorsement of sorts by adding it to a list of chemicals that do not harm the ozone layer. But an unintended effect of that action was to allow sellers of the chemical to  \n, \u201cnonhazardous,\u201d green and worker-friendly.         \n\nAs the chemical\u2019s popularity grew, E.P.A. officials worried about its use in spray glues, especially in cushion-making factories where the agency had determined that even with \u201cstate of the art\u201d ventilation, \u201cnPB-based adhesives cannot be reliably used in a manner that protects human health.\u201d         \n\nEnvironmental officials figured that OSHA, pressured by the Bush administration and Republican lawmakers to be more business-friendly, would not be capable of policing the growing threat. \u201cOSHA is tough,\u201d E.P.A. officials said, according to notes from a November 2006 meeting on concerns about nPB. \u201cBut their budget is small, and they are not going to crack down on small businesses.\u201d         \n\nOSHA has never set a standard establishing safety limits on workers\u2019 exposure to nPB. The E.P.A. recommended such a limit and considered banning the nPB glues, but it has yet to finalize the plan. It determined that most cushion companies using the glue had fewer than 100 employees, which meant they were less able to absorb the cost of another regulation.         \n\n\u201cThere just wasn\u2019t the political will,\u201d an E.P.A. official who was part of the decision-making said on the condition of anonymity.         \n\n \n from a 2005 workers\u2019 compensation log summed up the emerging situation at Royale. Beneath a column headed \u201cInjury or Illness\u201d stretched a dozen rows, each reading \u201cAlleged Neurological Injury\u201d \u2014 one for each worker in the Conover plant sickened in the first three months of the year. Each missed more than 40 days of work because of the glue fumes, which were especially intense after the company moved the work stations closer together.         \n\nThousands of additional pages of court and government documents, as well as interviews with more than two dozen current and former employees \u2014 some speaking on the condition of anonymity \u2014 present a fuller view of the conditions in the plant and how things got that way.         \n\nBy 2005, Efrain Robles Avila was using a walker because he could no longer stand on his own, according to medical records. Victor Gonzales, a father of three, needed help putting on his clothes because he had lost control of his hands. Laura Garcia, who had worked for Royale for less than a year, complained of a cold numbness running from her waist to her toes. \u201cIt was like your legs didn\u2019t receive the signal when you had to walk,\u201d she said in court documents.         \n\n \n. One worker recounted meeting a neighbor who asked why she was wearing a single red shoe. Only then did the worker realize her foot was bleeding profusely from a two-inch gash.         \n\nInside the plant, workers improvised. Some stood on scrap pieces of foam to cushion their feet and ease the stinging sensation creeping up their legs. One, Sonia Richards, arrived with her own respirator, but a manager told her to put it away, saying it was spooking other workers. In whispers, new employees were warned to visit the bathroom whenever the fog grew thick.         \n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t clear your head,\u201d a worker recalled being told, \u201cit will clear you.\u201d         \n\nRoyale is among the industry\u2019s most dangerous businesses,  \n. Federal officials found that it had exposed workers to dangerous levels of nPB at least a dozen times, more often than any other company. Since 2002, nearly three dozen Royale workers have been found to be breathing dangerous levels of glue fumes, federal records show.         \n\nCurrent and former employees say the number of workers sickened is most likely double that, since OSHA visited only periodically and turnover was high.         \n\nSome buyers of Royale cushions said they knew generally of the dangers of nPB, but expected their suppliers to take all required precautions. Lisa Hanly, vice president of Furniture Brands, which handles Broyhill and other well-known furniture, said, \u201cOur goal is to produce high-quality product, which meets all legal and safety requirements, at an affordable price.\u201d She said the company\u2019s inspections focused on suppliers overseas, where regulations are weaker than in the United States. Other companies that buy from Royale declined to comment.         \n\nRoyale workers became regular visitors at local health clinics, including the Clinic for People Without Health Insurance, then run by Dr. Ben Wofford.         \n\nLooking like \u201cupright cadavers,\u201d Dr. Wofford said, cushion workers arrived unable to stand on their own, supported under their arms by family members. They had showered and changed out of their work clothes, he said, but their breath still carried an odor he remembered from his boyhood days putting together model airplanes.         \n\nHe had watched for years as his patients\u2019 suffering worsened with the bottoming out of the state\u2019s tobacco, textile and furniture industries. When people are out of work, he explained in an interview in his office above the pharmacy in Newton, N.C., a diabetic ulcer that would normally cost a toe takes a leg. Their nonfatal hernia bleeds them to death.         \n\n\u201cYou kill jobs,\u201d Dr. Wofford said, \u201cyou kill patients.\u201d         \n\nReluctantly,  \n alerting OSHA about problems at Royale. One worker was in especially bad shape, he wrote: \u201cIndeed he may die as a result of his exposure.\u201d         \n\nBut Dr. Wofford also urged OSHA not to overreact. \u201cI would hate to see this plant\u2019s multiple shortcomings result in its being shut down,\u201d he wrote, warning of jobs that could be lost. \u201cMany are my patients and are already in dire straits economically.\u201d         \n\nReferring to one woman who was the sole support for herself and three children, he wrote, \u201cShe too is unlikely to find work if the effects of the neurotoxin are irreversible, as my neurological consultant thinks they may be.\u201d         \n\nOver the years, officials with Royale, which employs about 100 workers and had around $7.5 million in sales in 2011, have repeatedly said they have done all they can to make their three plants safe. They frequently took steps to improve the air in their plants, but their actions were also sometimes counterproductive \u2014 after improving ventilation, they failed to change filters, for example, or covered vents with plastic in the winter to keep out cold air, according to OSHA documents.         \n\nIn a recent interview, Mr. Isenhour, Royale\u2019s safety director, said the company never meant to harm anyone and initially did not realize the hazards of nPB. Royale has continued using nPB glues, he added, because alternatives are ineffective or risky.         \n\nGlues that use acetone, for example, are popular but highly flammable, he said. Converting the Royale plant to meet federal rules on fire safety would entail replacing the glue-spraying booths with metal walls, installing sprinklers and explosion-proof lighting and retraining workers, at a cost of tens of thousands of dollars, he added.         \n\nIn 2005, when seven workers became seriously ill at one plant, Mr. Isenhour said, Royale had to lay off 40 people, close the facility and spend $50,000 to move operations to another site and upgrade the ventilation there. OSHA found high levels of fumes in subsequent years because no one informed the company that fans and filters needed cleaning for ventilation to work properly, he said.         \n\nIf the company switched to a more expensive glue, he said, he would have to raise the price of each cushion, and the furniture makers Royale supplies would contract with Chinese competitors instead.         \n\n\u201cWe are trying to keep jobs in America,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s expensive.\u201d         \n\nBoth government officials and employers weigh the costs and benefits of protective measures. Many studies show that investing in workplace safety saves money in the long run, but economists say that does not prove true in every case. This, of course, raises the most difficult calculus of all: comparing the worth of a dangerous job versus no job at all. How should companies and regulators put a dollar value on workers\u2019 quality of life \u2014 indeed, on their very lives?         \n\nTo date, Royale has paid nearly a half-million dollars \u2014 in court settlements, required upgrades and less than $20,000 in OSHA fines related to glue fumes. Those costs \u2014 and the harm to workers \u2014 accumulated in slow motion. Cushion making is a boom-bust business, subject to the swings of big orders from furniture companies. Royale and others in the industry frequently use transient, nonunion and illegal immigrant laborers, according to workers and court documents, who are less likely to report hazards and document symptoms.         \n\nAs fast as workers were getting sick, managers found replacements.         \n\n\u201cFolks was limping in and getting worse,\u201d said Dewaun Teague, a former Royale manager. \u201cThen they would be let go, and we would hire more.\u201d         \n\nMr. Teague said Royale was a good company to work for in many ways. The owner, Clyde Goble, looked you in the eye when he shook your hand and remembered your children\u2019s birthdays, Mr. Teague said, adding, \u201cThis was family.\u201d         \n\nAfter receiving an anonymous complaint about glue fumes, Beverly Stone, an OSHA inspector,  \n in Taylorsville in May 2011. She toured the facility, tested the air and then filed a lengthy report.         \n\n\u201cVentilation did not appear to be working properly,\u201d it said, adding that at least 16 workers were breathing dangerous levels of glue fumes.         \n\nWorrisome enough on their own, Ms. Stone\u2019s findings were even more alarming because they were so similar to what OSHA documented in 1996, 2000, 2002 and 2005.         \n\nAgain and again, Royale workers got sick and contacted OSHA. Inspectors came and went. Little changed.         \n\nCompany officials were told to ventilate to the outside. They bought pedestal fans instead, and when OSHA inspectors returned, they found the fans turned off or malfunctioning. OSHA demanded respirators that would have cost the company $18. Managers instead handed out 90-cent dust masks \u2014 the type inspectors had told them were useless in blocking vapors.         \n\nThe agency advised the company to stop using nPB-based glues. And yet, each time inspectors showed up, they found more workers exposed to the chemical and at levels higher than what the glue companies were saying was safe.         \n\nBack and forth it went, as workers fell victim not just to toxic air but also to a federal agency\u2019s inability to enforce its requirements.         \n\nWhile agency inspectors consistently showed up within a day of receiving worker complaints, records show, they often did with one hand what they undid with the other. Sometimes they failed to levy fines because they did not believe they had the authority. Other times they undermined their own leverage by slashing the size of penalties in hopes of promoting cooperation from the company.         \n\nAfter each visit, the agency suggested abatements but never did follow-up air tests and appeared again only when sick workers complained.         \n\nFor its part, the company shuffled workers among its three plants in the frustrated hope that one of the sites might have better air flow. But the constant movement of these workers from plant to plant also made repeat problems look to regulators like isolated cases.         \n\nIn early 2011, when Royale officials realized that they could not fix the ventilation at the Taylorsville plant where Ms. Farley worked, they moved her and a half-dozen other workers to the other Taylorsville site. Ms. Farley\u2019s symptoms grew worse there; the ventilation problems had been identified by OSHA in 2002 but never corrected.         \n\nIf inspections are supposed to force companies to rectify problems and avoid future ones, that 2002 inspection was a failure. \u201c \n,\u201d the OSHA official wrote at the time, adding that the agency could not levy fines or mandate respirators because there was no federal safety standard involving nPB.         \n\nThat was a legal judgment call, one that many workplace safety experts say illustrates OSHA\u2019s unwillingness to exert its full authority. Though the agency has the legal means to force companies to protect workers better from certain chemicals even when there is no specific exposure level established by the agency as safe, OSHA rarely invokes this power for fear of sapping limited resources if the matter ends up in court.         \n\n\u201cWe do the best we can,\u201d said Kevin Beauregard, an assistant deputy OSHA commissioner in North Carolina, which is\u00a0among 25 states deputized by the federal government to oversee worker safety programs. He said that before his office could act in such instances, it must first prove that workers were exposed to a substance whose hazards were recognized in the industry and that the exposure was avoidable.         \n\nOSHA also rates health hazards as a lower priority than safety threats. In 1996, for instance, inspectors discovered that a machine part hit a Royale worker in the groin. The agency threatened to fine the company a total of $120,000, adding $5,000 to the fine for each day that the company failed to repair the machine. But when nPB levels remained high during five visits between 2002 and 2011, the agency never increased the penalties. The proposed total for all of Royale\u2019s health-related fines was $20,800, an amount the agency later lowered.         \n\nPartly, the emphasis on safety enforcement is a numbers game. OSHA\u2019s performance is often measured by lawmakers, advocacy groups and the news media based on how many inspections it does in a year; an inspector can do five times as many safety inspections in the time it typically takes to do one focused on health, where the issues may be less clear-cut. And the agency tends to face less public pressure about health enforcement, because the harm done by these sorts of hazards typically does not show up for years.         \n\nFurthermore, while the number of inspectors has grown under the Obama administration, OSHA still has just 2,400 responsible for overseeing roughly eight million work sites \u2014 roughly one inspector per 60,000 workers, a ratio that has not changed since 1970. The federal budget for protecting workers is less than half of that set aside for protecting fish and wildlife.         \n\nMr. Michaels, whose tenure leading OSHA since December 2009 has been characterized by more aggressive enforcement than that of his most recent predecessors, cites a deeper problem: the small amount that OSHA can levy in fines. The maximum penalty for a violation that causes a \u201csubstantial probability of death \u2014 or serious physical harm\u201d is $7,000. The highest fine for a willful and repeated violation is $70,000.         \n\nThis, Mr. Michaels said, pales in comparison with fines of up to $130,000 that the Department of Agriculture can levy if a dairy company refuses to pay fees that help the federal government advertise milk products, or the $325,000 that the Federal Communications Commission can fine a TV or radio station for indecent content.         \n\n\u201cIf the cost of compliance to our rules outweighs the penalties for breaking them, companies just take a \u2018catch me if you can\u2019 approach to worker safety and health,\u201d he said. And serious violations of the rules should not be misdemeanors, he said, but felonies, much like insider trading, tax crimes and antitrust violations.         \n\nBut Jeff Ruch, the director of  \n, a public health advocacy organization, said that, on average, OSHA now conducts health inspections and collects air samples less than half as often as it did under the Reagan administration.         \n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t hit someone with a fine,\u201d Mr. Ruch said, \u201cif you aren\u2019t on site looking to find the violations.\u201d         \n\nAs her truck crawled down a bumpy dirt road, Ms. Farley said she needed to go slowly because she could not afford to replace her duct-taped bumper if it fell off. Between money from breeding her four Rottweilers, food stamp assistance and the occasional help from her ex-husband or the local food bank, her finances leave little room for error.         \n\nShe stopped in a field dotted with narrow white trailers to pick up Cosondra Little, another former Royale worker, who limped as she approached. Ms. Little lives with her 24-year-old daughter, SoSonia, who is unemployed. What fresh tomatoes, collard greens and other vegetables the two eat come mostly from scavenging on nearby fields when farmers allow it. This has been the case, Ms. Little said, ever since she lost her job at the cushion plant in May 2003.         \n\n\u201cMy feet started to throw a fit,\u201d she said. First went her health insurance, then money for SoSonia\u2019s college tuition, then their savings, and finally the car.         \n\n\u201cYou try getting a job around here without a car,\u201d Ms. Little said, riding along a wooded stretch of Highway 16 just south of Taylorsville.         \n\nSoon the two women arrived at Martha Cardenas\u2019s house, where they were joined by two others, one a former cushion maker, the other a current one. They had gathered to explain that Royale is not unique.         \n\nAfter small talk about Ms. Cardenas\u2019s empanadas, the women stacked their medical records on the table. Different plants, different doctors, same glue. Broken lives reduced to physicians\u2019 scribbles. \u201cStaggered gait,\u201d \u201cnumb hands and feet,\u201d \u201cspinal pain.\u201d         \n\nUsually the same medical advice, too: find a different job; stop working with the glue. It \u201chas been clearly documented as a cause of\u201d nerve damage, Ms. Little\u2019s doctor wrote to her boss about nPB.         \n\nBut other jobs are hard to come by. And that is why everyone has wanted to keep Royale in business. \u201cNow none of us are working,\u201d Ms. Farley said. In Dr. Wofford\u2019s hesitant whistle-blower letter to OSHA, in a $50,000 loan that county officials gave to Royale, in OSHA\u2019s formula for lowering fines, there were vexing calculations seeking to strike the right balance between protecting jobs and safeguarding those holding them.         \n\nIn Ms. Cardenas\u2019s house, the women were doing some math of their own. One tried to tally how many hours she had spent in the unemployment office. Another added up her credit card debt and counted her doctors\u2019 visits. But mostly the women listed the subtler costs of their injuries, like the pounds gained from immobility or the addiction concerns with pain pills.         \n\nAs the women stood up to leave, several grabbed the wall for balance. Ms. Farley added a parting thought.         \n\n\u201cAnd all the while everyone thinks you\u2019re just faking,\u201d she said. The women agree that this is the worst part.
