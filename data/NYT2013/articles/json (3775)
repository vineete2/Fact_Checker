{"headline": "24 Recipients of MacArthur \u2018Genius\u2019 Awards Named", "body": "\nThe dancer-choreographer  \n, who recalled relying on food stamps just three years ago, was among the 13 men and 11 women officially named MacArthur fellows on Wednesday. Besides the imprimatur of achievement and future promise, the 2013 fellowships from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation come with a sweetened stipend of $625,000 paid over five years.         \n\n\u201cIt was amazing to me,\u201d Mr. Abraham, 36, said of receiving the good news via a recent telephone call from Cecilia Conrad, vice president of the program. \u201cIt was a shock. I was laughing about it; I was crying about it, it was so overwhelming. I\u2019ve been trying to figure out how to pay off my student loans to this day.\u201d         \n\nA Pittsburgh native whose latest work, \u201cPavement,\u201d uses dance to probe violence, Mr. Abraham lives in Brooklyn and is the founder and artistic director of his company, Kyle Abraham/Abraham.In.Motion. \u201cGetting an award like this lets me know I can continue to make work and pay my dancers and I can pay my rent.\u201d         \n\nAs in the past, some of the winners are well known, in their disciplines or on a broader stage, while others have been working quietly for years. One-third of the 2013 fellows live in New York City and, like Mr. Abraham, many are artists of distinction. The artists are Donald Antrim, 55, an associate professor in the writing program at Columbia University and the author of \u201cThe Verificationist,\u201d a novel about a meeting of psychoanalysts; Jeremy Denk, 43, the concert pianist on the faculty at the Bard College Conservatory of Music and Mannes College the New School for Music;  \n, 41, the jazz pianist and composer known for collaborations with poets;  \n, 32 a playwright, member of Steppenwolf Theater Company in Chicago and the author of \u201cChoir Boy,\u201d a play about competition and homophobia in elite all-black boys schools; and  \n, 45, the choreographer of classical ballet and an artist in resident at American Ballet Theater.         \n\n\u201cI want to use the money for the greater good of the community,\u201d said Mr. Iyer, whose latest project of note was \u201cHolding It Down: The Veterans\u2019 Dream Project,\u201d an exploration of the dreams of minority war veterans. Mr. Iyer, who lives in Harlem, added: \u201cA life in the arts is a life of service, Yo-Yo Ma once told me. That sits well with me.\u201d         \n\nThe youngest winner was  \n, 32, the fiction writer whose most recent short-story collection was \u201cVampires in the Lemon Grove.\u201d The oldest was  \n, 60, a photographer and video artist who for over 30 years has explored the subjects of black women, class, feminism and African-American history. She lives in Syracuse.         \n\n\u201cThe timing was really amazing,\u201d Ms. Russell said of her MacArthur award, adding that she had been moving from city to city to take a series of writing jobs at colleges and universities to support herself.         \n\n\u201cI was really craving a stable home,\u201d said Ms. Russell, who lives in New York and wants to stay put. \u201cI\u2019m working on a second novel and short stories \u2014 it\u2019s not the most lucrative form. I\u2019ve felt there are all these imaginary worlds that are probably pre-emptively foreclosed on because writers cannot support themselves. The MacArthur is this amazing license to take some imaginative risks because you have this safety net.\u201d         \n\nAmong the other fellows are Angela Duckworth, 43, a psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania who is studying how characteristics like grit and self-control influence academic achievement; Margaret Stock, 51, a lawyer in Anchorage who is working to shape immigration policy and help military families; and C. Kevin Boyce, 39, a paleobotanist at Stanford University who is examining the connection between the remains of ancient plants and present-day ecosystems.         \n\nThe stipend, which comes with no strings attached, increased this year from $500,000, the amount since 2002. Ms. Conrad said that she and other MacArthur officials decided on the increase after considering new awards in science, other fellowships, inflation and teaching salaries. Ms. Conrad, for the first time, made most of the telephone calls informing the fellows of their windfall.         \n\n\u201cIt was thrilling because people\u2019s reactions told you how important this recognition was for so many of them,\u201d Ms. Conrad said. She also ran into the inevitable skepticism that comes with a life-changing phone call. \u201cAt least one person asked me what my name was and how I spelled it,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI could hear him tapping \u2014 he was Googling me as we spoke.\u201d         \n\nThe other winners this year include Phil Baran, 36, an organic chemist at Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif.; Jeffrey Brenner, 44, a primary-care physician in Camden, N.J.; Colin Camerer, 53, a behavioral economist at the California Institute of Technology; Craig Fennie, 40, a materials scientist at Cornell; Robin Fleming, 57, a medieval historian at Boston College; Carl Haber, 54, an audio preservationist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif; and Dina Katabi, 42, a computer scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.         \n\nThey are joined by Julie Livingston, 46, a public health historian and anthropologist at Rutgers University in New Jersey; David Lobell, 34, an agricultural ecologist at Stanford; Susan Murphy 55, a statistician at the University of Michigan; Sheila Nirenberg, a neuroscientist at Weill Cornell Medical College; Ana Maria Rey, 36, an atomic physicist at the University of Colorado, Boulder; and Sara Seager, 42, an astrophysicist at M.I.T.
