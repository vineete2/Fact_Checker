{"headline": "Tearful in Court, Pistorius Later Disputes Murder Charge", "body": "\nJOHANNESBURG \u2014 The prosecution in the case against  \n, the double-amputee track star accused of fatally shooting his girlfriend, said Friday that it planned to charge him with \u201cpremeditated murder,\u201d the most serious murder charge under South African criminal law, as Mr. Pistorius made a tearful appearance at a courtroom in the South African capital, Pretoria.         \n\nDressed in a gray suit and a blue shirt, Mr. Pistorius struggled to maintain his composure. He repeatedly wept, at times sobbing and holding his face in his hands. Mr. Pistorius did not speak or enter a plea. But later on Friday  \n released by his agent said that he disputed the murder charge \u201cin the strongest terms\u201d and that \u201cour thoughts and prayers today should be\u201d for the woman who was shot, Reeva Steenkamp, and her family, \u201cregardless of the circumstances of this terrible, terrible tragedy.\u201d         \n\nThe defense asked the magistrate, Desmond Nair, for a postponement of the bail hearing, and the case was adjourned until Tuesday. Mr. Pistorius was sent to a Pretoria police station, where he will remain in custody until his next court appearance.         \n\nIf convicted, Mr. Pistorius would face a mandatory life sentence, though under South African law he would be eligible for parole in 25 years at the latest.  \n abolished the death penalty in 1995.         \n\nThe accusation against the man nicknamed the Blade Runner stunned a nation that had seen him as a national hero who had overcome the acute challenge of being born without fibula bones. Both of his legs were amputated below the knee as an infant, and yet he still became the first  \n sprinter to compete against able-bodied athletes at the Olympics in London last year.         \n\nGrim-faced and looking tired, Mr. Pistorius entered the court as the events at his home in Pretoria eclipsed a State of the Nation address by President  \n on Thursday evening and took up the front page headlines in many newspapers on Friday. \u201cGolden Boy Loses Shine,\u201d said a one in The Sowetan. \u201cOscar\u2019s Bloody Valentine,\u201d The Daily Sun blared its front page.         \n\nIn editorials, newspapers cautioned against a rush to judgment.         \n\n\u201cIt will be up to a judge to decide if there was any criminal culpability,\u201d said  \n in The Times, a national daily. \u201cUntil then, innocence needs to be presumed.\u201d         \n\nJustice Malala, a columnist and political analyst, wrote in  \n in The Guardian, \u201cIn a country of very few heroes, particularly those who transcend the always-present color line, we do not want them to flicker and die.\u201d But he added, \u201cNow he is fallen, and we are lost.\u201d         \n\nFor others, Ms. Steenkamp\u2019s death was a grim reminder of the violence that pervades South African life. The South African Institute of Race Relations pointed out that Ms. Steenkamp was just  \n. Gun control advocates said they hoped her death would lead to a further tightening of gun ownership rules.         \n\nAn impassioned editorial in The Star, another national daily newspaper, said: \u201cThe true tragedy of our country is that the abnormal is becoming the normal. Violent crime has transcended and redefined the benchmark of brutality \u2014 and we accept it.\u201d         \n\nThe courtroom in Pretoria was packed with journalists from around the world. Some relatives of Mr. Pistorius had to squeeze into the crowded standing area at the back of the courtroom. Members of his family, also weeping, were in the courtroom when he appeared.         \n\nPolice officials have indicated that they will oppose an expected application for bail.         \n\nEarly Thursday morning, the police arrived at Mr. Pistorius\u2019s house in a gated community in Pretoria to find Ms. Steenkamp in a puddle of blood, dead from gunshot wounds. Mr. Pistorius, 26, who ran on carbon-fiber blades that earned him his nickname, was charged with murder.         \n\nMs. Steenkamp, 29, was a model about to make her debut on a reality television show.         \n\nEarly news reports said that Mr. Pistorius, a gun enthusiast, had mistaken his girlfriend for an intruder. But police officers discounted that notion and disclosed previous law enforcement complaints about domestic episodes at his home.         \n\nJenna Edkins, a woman who said she had dated Mr. Pistorius on and off for years, took to Twitter to defend him.         \n\n\u201cI have dated Oscar on off for 5 years, not once has he ever lifted a finger to me, made me fear for my life,\u201d she posted on Friday.
