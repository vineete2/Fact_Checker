{"headline": "Rejecting Billions, Snapchat Expects a Better Offer", "body": "\nWhat business makes no money, has yet to pass its third anniversary and just turned down an offer worth billions of dollars? Snapchat, a social media service run by a pair of 20-somethings who until last month worked out of a beachfront bungalow in Venice, Calif.         \n\nThanks to today\u2019s rabid rat race for the hottest social media start-ups, Snapchat has joined the list of tech companies \u2014 like Tumblr and Instagram \u2014 with no money coming in but multiple sky-high takeover offers. So far, Snapchat\u2019s leaders have balked at the offers, according to three people with knowledge of the overtures, including a recent multibillion-dollar proposal from  \n, the biggest social network of them all.         \n\nIt\u2019s not that they don\u2019t want billions of dollars. In part, it\u2019s because they think making a deal now would leave many billions more on the table.         \n\nThe service, started in 2011 by Evan Spiegel, 23, and Bobby Murphy, 25, two former Stanford fraternity brothers, lets users send photo and video messages that disappear after they are viewed. Snapchat quickly gained a reputation as an easy way to send sexually suggestive photos, but it also picked up steam as a fun and easy way to trade photo messages.         \n\nThe company has in recent months become one of the most sought-after businesses in the tech industry, getting attention from top Silicon Valley companies and venture capital firms, as well as international technology companies.         \n\nIn the past, several start-ups found even greater success by passing up a billion dollars or more, including Facebook and Twitter. Even Twitter, with its red-hot debut on the public market, still has skeptics who question whether it can grow enough to justify its current market capitalization of more than $20 billion.         \n\nBut Silicon Valley is littered with many more entrepreneurs whose big dreams went unfulfilled, people who were at the helm of the next big thing and lost momentum before they could cash out.         \n\n\u201cI think this is classic bird-in-hand versus bird-in-bush,\u201d said Julie A. Ask, an analyst at Forrester Research. \u201cSnapchat must believe the bird-in-bush is bigger.\u201d         \n\nThere are some suggestions about why Snapchat thinks it will be worth far more later than it is now. For one thing, Snapchat\u2019s leaders think it might be one of the first social media companies in the United States to build its business largely around revenue beyond advertising.         \n\nOn stage at an industry event in September, Mr. Spiegel said that he wanted to duplicate the success of overseas chatting applications like WeChat.         \n\nMany such companies, particularly WeChat and Line, have found ways to make money from their applications through virtual goods and games. WeChat, which is based in China and operated by a company called Tencent, allows its users to subscribe to brands like Starbucks and Nike and receive messages from them. Line, a Japanese messaging app, has $10 million a month in revenue from selling stickers that users can send to each other while chatting with friends.         \n\nBut the decision appears to have also been influenced by one of Snapchat\u2019s big venture backers, Benchmark Capital, according to a person close to the talks. Before leading an investment in Snapchat, Benchmark led an early bet on Instagram, a photo service, and was disappointed when Instagram\u2019s founders decided to sell to Facebook for $1 billion last year. Despite the high price tag, the firm thought Instagram could have succeeded as a stand-alone company, or at least could have brought a higher offer.         \n\nEight months after the Instagram sale, Benchmark switched tactics and placed an initial $13 million bet on Snapchat. Benchmark executives thought they might be able to profit from Facebook fatigue by investing in services like Snapchat that offered users \u2014 particularly teenagers \u2014 greater privacy.         \n\nIt is those teenagers who most interest Facebook. In an earnings call this month, Facebook said that its youngest users were using its service less.         \n\nStill, the news about Snapchat rejecting Facebook\u2019s offer, \n by The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, sent a small shock through the industry. Both Snapchat and Facebook declined to comment.         \n\nSnapchat and applications like it represent a coming sea change in social media, one not necessarily defined by shared or public interactions. These services present an antidote to mainstream services that are meant to capture life moments so they can be shared, liked and commented on. Snapchat\u2019s appeal lies largely in the lack of permanence. It offers a reprieve from worrying about awkward or unflattering photos turning up unexpectedly.         \n\nSnapchat recently said that it now processed upward of 350 million messages a day. In February, the company was processing only 60 million a day.         \n\nOther messaging services similar to Snapchat are also quickly gaining in popularity. WhatsApp, KakaoTalk, Kik, WeChat and Line, to name a few, have added hundreds of millions of users in the last few years, and each continues to grow.         \n\nThat rocketlike growth has emboldened Snapchat\u2019s leaders to hold out for a better deal, and with a suitor of their choice, at least for now. One person with knowledge of the talks, who would speak only on the condition of anonymity, said one roadblock in the talks with Facebook was that Mr. Spiegel questioned whether he wanted to work for Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s young billionaire chief executive.         \n\nIn addition, Snapchat relishes being a successful company outside Silicon Valley. In December, when the company was still getting its footing in the social media market, Mr. Zuckerberg requested a meeting. But he traveled to Venice, Calif., to meet with the company, according to Snapchat\u2019s founders, instead of them visiting him at his headquarters in Northern California.         \n\nShortly after the meeting, Facebook started a similar product called Poke. But Poke never took off. Even Facebook\u2019s stand-alone messaging product, called Messenger, has struggled to attain the same kind of momentum that rivals have gained. Facebook released a new Messenger mobile app on Wednesday.         \n\nAnd in Silicon Valley, where something new could pop up at any time, tech companies and investors are often compelled to act when they can \u2014 sometimes with fear and little regard for the number of zeros involved.         \n\nAnother potential suitor for Snapchat is Tencent, one of the three Internet giants in China. In September, Pony Ma, one of the founders of Tencent, spoke of that constant tension when discussing his interest in Snapchat.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m facing a crisis in this industry, said Mr. Ma. \u201cYoung people, the things they like on the Internet, increasingly I don\u2019t understand it. This is my biggest worry.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/14/technology/rejecting-billions-snapchat-expects-a-better-offer.html", "date": "2013-11-13", "description": "Snapchat, a social media service, has become one of the most sought-after businesses in the technology industry."}
