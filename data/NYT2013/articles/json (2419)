{"headline": "Israel Hints at New Strikes, Warning Syria Not to Hit Back", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In a clear warning to Syria to stop the transfer of advanced weapons to Islamic militants in the region, a senior Israeli official signaled on Wednesday that Israel was considering additional military strikes to prevent that from happening and that the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, would face crippling consequences if he retaliated.         \n\n\u201cIsrael is determined to continue to prevent the transfer of advanced weapons to Hezbollah,\u201d the Israeli official said. \u201cThe transfer of such weapons to Hezbollah will destabilize and endanger the entire region.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIf Syrian President Assad reacts by attacking Israel, or tries to strike Israel through his terrorist proxies,\u201d the official said, \u201che will risk forfeiting his regime, for Israel will retaliate.\u201d         \n\nThe Israeli official, who had been briefed by high-level officials on Israel\u2019s assessment of the situation in Syria, declined to be identified, citing the need to protect internal Israeli government deliberations. He contacted The New York Times on Wednesday.         \n\nThe precise motives for Israel\u2019s warning were uncertain: Israel could be seeking to restrain Syria\u2019s behavior to avoid taking further military action, or alerting other countries to another military strike. That would increase the tension in an already fraught situation in Syria, where a civil war has been raging for more than two years.         \n\nThere could be a secondary audience for the warning, analysts said, in Hezbollah and its primary supporter, Iran. Hezbollah, which is based in Lebanon, has said in recent days it could use weapons supplied by Iran to retaliate for recent Israeli strikes on Syria.         \n\nNearly two weeks ago, Israeli warplanes carried out two strikes in Syria, the first hitting bases of Syria\u2019s elite Republican Guard and storehouses of long-range missiles, in addition to a military research center that American officials have called the country\u2019s main chemical weapons site.         \n\nA more limited strike on May 3 at Damascus International Airport was also meant to destroy weapons being sent from Iran to Hezbollah. The Israeli government did not confirm either of the attacks, which followed another earlier this year.         \n\nThe Syrian government publicly condemned Israel for the assaults, saying it \u201copened the door to all possibilities.\u201d The Syrian deputy foreign minister, Faisal Mekdad, declared, \u201cWe will respond immediately and harshly to any additional attack by Israel.\u201d         \n\nMr. Assad and Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, have each said in recent days that the Israeli-Syrian border, which has been relatively quiet despite the more than two years of civil war inside Syria, could become a \u201cresistance front,\u201d in response to Israeli attacks.         \n\nOn Wednesday, mortar shells, fired from across the Syrian border, landed in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. The shells landed on Mount Hermon, a popular tourist site, and were the latest in a series of what Israel has generally considered errant fire from internal Syrian fighting.         \n\nIsrael did not fire back, as it had on several previous occasions, but it closed Mount Hermon to the public for several hours during a Jewish holiday on which hiking in the Golan is popular.         \n\nIn his comments, the Israeli official said that \u201cIsrael has so far refrained from intervening in Syria\u2019s civil war and will maintain this policy as long as Assad refrains from attacking Israel directly or indirectly.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIsrael,\u201d he said, \u201cwill continue its policy of interdicting attempts to strengthen Hezbollah, but will not intercede in the Syrian civil war as long as Assad desists from direct or indirect attacks against Israel.\u201d         \n\nMark Regev, a spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, declined to discuss the meaning of the Israeli official\u2019s statement. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to comment on the story,\u201d he said.         \n\nAmerican and Israeli political analysts agree that Israel has little motive to intervene in Syria\u2019s civil war, but that it is deeply concerned about the transfer of advanced weapons, as well as the danger that Mr. Assad\u2019s stockpiles of chemical weapons could be used against it.
