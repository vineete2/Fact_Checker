{"headline": "A Rare Visit to New York\u2019s Potter\u2019s Field on Hart Island", "body": "\nOn Tuesday morning, the first snow flurries of the season fell on New York\u2019s potter\u2019s field, drifting down into an open trench, dusting the dirt next to hundreds of corpses in bare wooden caskets.         \n\nHere on a grassy expanse toward the south end of Hart Island, off the Bronx, the trenches are 10 feet deep and as long as a football field. They fill up steadily with the dead \u2014 the homeless, poor, stillborn and other unclaimed bodies \u2014 delivered by truck and ferry from all over New York City, for unceremonious interment.         \n\nThe current trench should be filled before Christmas. Then the gravediggers, a cadre of inmates bused over from Rikers Island on Tuesdays through Fridays, will begin sowing the next crop of caskets in a pit, freshly dug and running adjacent, said Capt. Martin Thompson of the city\u2019s  \n, which manages operations on the island.         \n\nHis crews follow a grim arithmetic: up to 1,500 bodies buried a year, organized into 70-foot-long plots that, with caskets stacked three-high in rows of six, can hold about 150 adults each, or 1,000 infants, who are buried in trenches separate from the adults. On this 101-acre island, the number of burials since 1869 now approaches one million.         \n\nThe tour on Tuesday was the first time a reporter had been allowed near the burial site in years, despite the many requests the department receives. And even that went only so far. Though correction officials had earlier consented to a viewing of burials, they announced, just before departing on the ferry from City Island, that no bodies would be arriving on that day after all. They later said that since the previous day,  \n, was a city holiday, no bodies had been prepared for delivery.         \n\nKeeping tight restrictions on burial information and visitation has long been a priority for the department, but recent developments suggest the beginning of a change in policy.         \n\nFor years, correction officials arranged  \n, and they have allowed \u201cclosure visits\u201d since 2007 for family members of people buried on the island. Those take place at a gazebo the agency built for mourners, near the ferry dock, well away from the burial areas and with no view of the graves. Originally, ferry service was by appointment only, and exclusively for relatives possessing a death certificate of a loved one. More recently, the department dropped the requirement that visitors be related to a buried loved one, and instituted monthly ferry service, but it still let visitors go no farther than the gazebo.         \n\nThis month, the department\u2019s lawyers approved a special request by a group of eight women seeking to visit their infants\u2019 grave sites on the island. Faced with a lawsuit, the agency notified Mark Taylor, a Manhattan lawyer representing the women pro bono, that the visits would soon be granted, albeit with tight restrictions.         \n\nMr. Taylor said he was amazed that the visits were granted. The agency\u2019s decision, he said, would serve as a precedent to pave the way for similar requests.         \n\n\u201cOnce granted, it\u2019s hard for them, legally, to go back,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be very difficult for them to deny it to others.\u201d         \n\nAgency officials in the past have emphasized the need to keep the island restricted because of dangerous conditions, security concerns regarding the inmate laborers, and the lack of amenities and utilities, including restrooms, on the island. A compound for inmates and correction officers does have a propane-fueled kitchen, restrooms and an active water main connected to the mainland, but it is off-limits to visitors, encircled by a fence topped with razor wire.         \n\nOn the island, a lush overgrowth of greenery envelops crumbling buildings that reflect the island\u2019s history \u2014 a chronology that includes uses as a Civil War prison, a lunatic asylum, a tuberculosis hospital and a boys\u2019 reformatory.         \n\nNo-trespassing signs ring the island\u2019s rocky and sandy shorelines, even as recreational fishermen and day-sailors ply the waters just off its shores.         \n\nA spokesman for the department would not comment on Hart Island issues and would not permit a photographer on the island; the reporter had to leave his camera and phone behind during the visit.         \n\nAdvocates for opening up Hart Island question the use of inmate labor to perform burials, and argue that personnel hired and trained to oversee the city\u2019s jail system are ill-equipped to run a cemetery and interact with bereaved loved ones.         \n\nRestrictions designed to prevent security breaches, they say, lead to difficulty finding information on the dead and limit opportunities for visitation. Advocates also argue that the rules stigmatize the visiting process, with relatives of the dead being treated like prisoners rather than mourners.
