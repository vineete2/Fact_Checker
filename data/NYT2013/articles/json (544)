{"headline": "I.R.S. Scrutiny Went Beyond the Political", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In 2010, a tiny  \n-rights group called Minnesota Break the Bonds applied to the  \n for tax-exempt status. Two years and a lot of prodding later, the I.R.S. sent the group\u2019s leaders a series of questions and requests almost identical to the ones it was sending to  \n groups at the time.         \n\nWhat are \u201cthe qualifications and experience\u201d of Break the Bonds instructors? Does the group \u201cpresent a sufficiently full and fair explanation of the relevant facts\u201d about the West Bank and Gaza? Provide copies of pamphlets, brochures or other literature distributed at group events? Reveal all fees collected and \u201cany voluntary contributions\u201d made at group functions? Provide a template of petitions, postcards and any other material used to influence legislation, and a detailed accounting of the time and money spent to influence state legislators?         \n\nThe controversy that erupted in May has focused on an ideological question: Were conservative groups singled out for special treatment based on their politics, or did the I.R.S. equally target liberal groups? But a closer look at the I.R.S. operation suggests that the problem was less about ideology and more about how a process instructing reviewers to \u201cbe on the lookout\u201d for selected terms was applied to any group that mentioned certain words in its application.         \n\nOrganizations approached by The New York Times based on specific \u201clookout list\u201d warnings, like advocates for people in \u201coccupied territories\u201d and \u201copen source software developers,\u201d told similar stories of long waits, intrusive inquiries and bureaucratic hassles that pointed to no particular bias but rather to a process that became too rigid and too broad. The lists often did point to legitimate issues: partisan political campaign organizations seeking tax-exempt status, or commercial businesses hoping to cloak themselves as nonprofit groups. But even I.R.S. officials say lookout list warnings were often pursued in a ham-handed or overly rigid way.         \n\nLast month, the acting I.R.S. commissioner, Daniel I. Werfel, formally ordered an end to such lists after discovering that they were still in use after the controversy flared up.         \n\nSylvia Schwarz, a co-director of the Break the Bonds group, shrugged at the treatment meted out by the I.R.S. She was used to rough scrutiny in a country that tilts against the Palestinians, she said. But the same questions, asked of conservative organizations, led to the dismissals of top I.R.S. officials, prompting criminal and Congressional investigations, scarring the reputation of the nation\u2019s tax collection agency and eliciting charges that the White House had used the agency to pursue its political opponents.         \n\nTwo months of investigation by Congress and the I.R.S. has produced new documents that have clouded much of the controversy\u2019s narrative. In the more complicated picture now emerging, many organizations other than conservative groups were singled out: \u201cprogressive\u201d organizations,  \n purveyors, organizations formed to carry out  \n\u2019s  \n, and open source software developers who create software tools for computer code writers and distribute them free of charge.         \n\n\u201cAs soon as you say the words \u2018open source,\u2019 like other organizations that use \u2018Tea Party\u2019 or \u2018Occupy,\u2019 it gets you red-flagged,\u201d said Luis Villa, a lawyer and a member of the board of directors of the Open Source Initiative. The I.R.S. feared that such groups were really moneymaking enterprises.         \n\nAccording to the Treasury inspector general for tax administration, the I.R.S. received 199,689 applications for tax-exempt status between 2010 and 2012. In 2012 alone, the agency received 73,319, of which about 22,000 were not approved in the initial review process. The inspector general looked at 296 applications flagged as potentially being from political groups. That means most of the applications pulled aside for further scrutiny in those years had nothing to do with politics, conservative or liberal, just as most of the red flags thrown up by the I.R.S.\u2019s lookout lists were not overtly political.         \n\nChi Eta Phi Sorority, a mainly African-American nurses\u2019 society that advertises its mission as \u201csocial change,\u201d applied for 501(c)(3) charitable status on June 24, 2011, days before the I.R.S. tightened its scrutiny of tax exemption applications. The organization fell under a \u201cgroup rulings\u201d flag in one of the lookout lists. Two years and 73 questions later, Chi Eta Phi is still waiting for the I.R.S.\u2019s Cincinnati office, which handles the tax exemption applications, to respond.
