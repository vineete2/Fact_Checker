{"headline": "A Company-Worthy Ginger Cake with Molasses and Stout", "body": "\n \n         \n\nThere is gingerbread, a homey and rustic snack with tea. And then there is ginger cake, which is fancier and company-worthy and meant for dessert.         \n\nThis rich, fragrant confection from  \n in the West Village is decidedly on the cake side of this gingery spectrum.         \n\nIt\u2019s impressive on many levels, the first of which is because it\u2019s baked in a Bundt pan coated with Demerara (raw) sugar. This gives the cake a crystalline crunch that melts into its tender, moist crumb. Then there\u2019s the complexity of flavor. The combination of grated fresh ginger root and powdered ginger, along with a dash of black pepper and cloves, imbues this cake with a particularly intense spiciness. And a good measure of stout and molasses contributes a pleasantly bitter edge.         \n\nMake sure to use an excellent stout here. Since you\u2019ll only use part of a bottle, choose one you\u2019d be happy to finish off while the cake is in the oven.         \n\nAs with most oil-based baked goods, this keeps well without drying out, and can be made a day or two ahead. Store it wrapped in foil at room temperature. Then serve it with tangy whipped cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche to offset the sugar coating on the cake. Gingerbread never had it so good.         \n\nRecipe: \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/26/dining/a-company-worthy-ginger-cake-with-molasses-and-stout.html", "date": "2013-11-25", "description": "Grated fresh ginger root, along with a dash of black pepper and cloves, imbues The Marrow\u2019s ginger stout cake with intense spiciness."}
