{"headline": "That Bland Annuity Notice May Be Anything but Routine", "body": "\nFOR owners of variable annuities, reading letters that may look like routine notices from an insurance company might be the difference between receiving the payment they expect and one that is significantly lower.         \n\nThat\u2019s because several insurance companies that sold variable annuities with generous income or death benefits before the financial crisis are having sellers\u2019 remorse. Meeting those obligations \u2014 often guaranteed returns or payouts of 6 or 7 percent \u2014 has become tougher with interest rates low and the costs to hedge these guarantees high.         \n\nNow these companies are trying to persuade annuity owners to take buyouts or, in one case, are insisting that clients move into investments with lower returns \u2014 with the penalty of losing their guaranteed payment if they do not. Many of these notices arrive as bland-looking letters with little indication that they may be urgent.         \n\n\u201cIt caught the distributors off guard that the carriers would make these kind of changes, particularly to existing clients,\u201d said Bernie Gacona, director of annuities at Wells Fargo, a large distributor of annuities. \u201cWe don\u2019t have issues when carriers are making changes to the products with new clients \u2014 they don\u2019t have to buy it. With existing clients, you\u2019re pretty stuck.\u201d         \n\nAXA Financial, which made an offer to buy out death benefits last fall, has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to expand the program to include riders that guarantee the rate of accumulation in an annuity. AXA would pay the annuity holder a lump sum to give up the rider.         \n\n\u201cThere were a lot of benefits sold by us and others prefinancial crisis that have become much more expensive than anticipated,\u201d said Todd Solash, managing director of product development at AXA. \u201cIt\u2019s fully voluntary. We\u2019ll put money in, in exchange for canceling the riders.\u201d         \n\nThe Hartford, which is getting out of the annuity business, has gone further: it has sent letters to clients and advisers saying that they have until October to change the asset allocation in certain variable annuities. The goal is to lower the client\u2019s balance and therefore the amount the company will have to pay out. If they do not do this, they will lose the rider that guaranteed a payment regardless of the cash value of the annuity. Instead of getting a 5 percent guaranteed payout for life, the owner would get a lower payout based on a lower account value.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to note that the investment changes are not applicable to all contract owners, but to those where the investment changes are permitted under the existing contracts,\u201d said Shannon Lapierre, a spokeswoman for The Hartford.         \n\nThe Hartford\u2019s original letter to advisers in May, given to The New York Times, was vague about what was happening. It put changes to the investments people were allowed to make toward the end and made no mention of the severe penalties. Instead, it referred advisers to a Web site for more information.         \n\nA letter sent to clients in June highlighted that \u201cthe withdrawal feature of your optional benefit rider will be revoked\u201d with the last three words in capital letters. Ms. Lapierre said additional letters would be sent from now till the Oct. 4 deadline.         \n\nWhile the changes these two companies are making are at different ends of a spectrum, they are part of a trend with variable annuities sold in better times. Last fall  \n Prudential Annuities\u2019 canceling provisions in 14 annuities with guaranteed payouts that allowed owners to continue to add money to them. Earlier this year, AXA also eliminated two dozen investment options and moved clients\u2019 money into different funds.         \n\nThese changes are also emblematic of how complicated these types of annuities have become. Still, in a time of low returns and few guaranteed sources of income, there is often a desire for the perceived security of annuities, which come in many forms.         \n\nSo, how should some people consider what they already own? How should others consider a sales pitch to buy a new annuity?         \n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that all of these changes are legal, and the company\u2019s right to do what it is doing is detailed in contracts that stretch to hundreds of pages. That is part of the problem, of course, since people often do not read those contracts closely.
