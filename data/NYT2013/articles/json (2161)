{"headline": "Fried Chicken\u2019s Northern Exposure", "body": "\nHere\u2019s a culinary etiquette question: Does a bottle of bourbon qualify as a \u201cdish,\u201d as in \u201cbring your favorite Southern dish\u201d?         \n\nAll I can tell you is that it was answered in the affirmative by at least one person attending a memorable fried-chicken brunch in Westport, Mass.         \n\nMy friend and frequent co-author, Chris Schlesinger, and I have become converts to the idea of  \n. And before you say: \u201cOutdoors? In December?\u201d let me remind you that people grill all year, even with snow on the ground.         \n\nThe motivation to fry outdoors is high. Frying anything in the house is a bit of a pain because you have to worry about spattering grease and lingering odors, particularly if you\u2019re cooking enough for a crowd. Taking it outside gets rid of those concerns. And since putting a pan of oil over a live grilling fire is a recipe for disaster, gas came to the rescue.         \n\nOur first foray into the world of outdoor gas cooking was  \n. But as befits someone raised in the South, Chris\u2019s real love in this department is fried chicken. So fried chicken was next on the agenda.         \n\nNow, this group of friends is particularly fond of theme meals, and no one is more enthusiastic than Chris himself. In the last several months, Westport has had a crab fest, a paella contest and a stone crab night, a schnitzel night and a kofte night.         \n\nSo when another friend, Dougie Reed, known as Big Dog, who hails from Louisiana, suggested a Southern brunch as a showcase for the fried chicken, Chris was sold.         \n\nTheme dinners are a bit like costume parties: some people take them more seriously than others. There was corn bread, sweet potato-pecan salad and collard greens with ham hocks. But someone, perhaps a cranky Yankee, brought as his \u201cdish\u201d a bottle of Virginia Gentleman bourbon. As seemed only proper, glasses were eschewed and the bottle was passed around along with the pimento cheese crackers.         \n\nFortunately, by the time the bottle started making the rounds, the frying was done. One reason fried chicken is ideal party food is that it can be (some say should be) made in advance and served at room temperature, when its flavor is at its peak.         \n\nChris\u2019s version takes this virtue even further, since it is cooked in two stages. First, you fry the chicken to render the fat from the skin and get it beautifully browned. Then, you put it in a low oven to finish cooking it all the way through. Not only does this result in more-tender chicken, but it also makes for a more relaxed and low-key approach. What this method doesn\u2019t produce, compared with other, more frantic techniques, is super-crisp skin. But that\u2019s not a concern to Chris.         \n\n\u201cThe whole idea of extra-crisp skin has been overdone in my opinion,\u201d he said. \u201cI go with original recipe.\u201d         \n\nThat means that the skin, while crisp, is not crackling. Much more important here than the crispness of the skin is the mixture of herbs and spices applied to it.         \n\n\u201cMost people put the herbs and spices in the flour,\u201d Chris said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t because you get more of the herb flavor when it\u2019s applied separately.\u201d         \n\nThe major herb component is rubbed sage. This is nothing more than dried sage with the texture of a rough powder. If you have fresh sage handy, just pick and dry the leaves (in the sun is best, but three minutes or so in the microwave, stirring a few times, will also do the trick), then rub them between your fingers to get the texture you like. Or you can buy bottled rubbed sage. Just avoid bottled sage powder, which tends to have a dusty flavor.         \n\nAnother layer of flavor is added by putting a couple of bacon strips in the cooking oil. Its primary purpose is technical: It slightly lowers the smoke point of the oil, which causes the chicken to brown quicker. But as a double bonus, it also gives the chicken a slight smokiness, and you end up with deep-fried bacon to give to your favorite guest or, more likely, save for yourself.         \n\nIf there is any chicken left over, you can take advantage of yet another of its virtues: it\u2019s almost better the next day.         \n\nAt this particular brunch, not only did the guests eat every morsel of chicken, but many also insisted it was the best they\u2019d ever had. (The bourbon might have had something to do with it.) This in turn allowed Chris to utter one of the oldest, cheesiest lines in culinary braggadocio, one that he had been wanting to use for years: \u201cIf the Colonel had my recipe, he\u2019d be a general.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/04/dining/fried-chickens-northern-exposure.html", "date": "2013-12-03", "description": "When frying inside, you have to worry about spattering grease and lingering odors.
