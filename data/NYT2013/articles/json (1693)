{"headline": "Williamsburg-Appalachia- Country-Blues Goes Pop", "body": "\nValerie June, the country-and-blues-ish musician, was exploring the vintage stringed-instrument store and repair shop RetroFret \u2014 a sprawling series of rooms accessible to the public only through a secret-feeling rooftop garden, which was itself up a flight of stairs and behind a nondescript silver door on an otherwise abandoned-seeming block in Brooklyn\u2019s Gowanus neighborhood. A friend had introduced her to a luthier there for the purposes of repairing a 1920s-era banjo ukulele that she played the previous night at a gig in the East Village.         \n\nJune, with her dreadlocks piled into an updo, slipped easily into banjo banter with the tattooed RetroFret luthiers. Banjo ukuleles are called banjoleles, she said, \u201cbut I call \u2019em babies.\u201d She laughed about a few imitation \u201cmother of toilet seat\u201d pearloid instruments before admiring a 1924 Martin ukulele, which she cradled lovingly in her arms for a few moments before flipping the tag dangling from its neck. \u201cWow,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the Cadillac.\u201d It cost $12,000.         \n\nJune\u2019s debut album, \u201cPushin\u2019 Against a Stone,\u201d which came out Aug. 13, relies on trumpets, fiddles and those banjoleles from the 1920s. Her music could be described as some kind of hybrid of country-blues-Americana- Appalachia-Brooklyn. Over sushi in Greenpoint, she called it \u201can amalgamation of blues and folk and country and gospel.\u201d Or \u201corganic moonshine roots,\u201d in shorthand. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of Memphis,\u201d she told me. \u201cI went to two churches \u2014 one was black, and one was predominantly white \u2014 and I learned about all kinds of music.\u201d         \n\nJune, who is 31, has a bit of an easygoing vibe, as if success had just landed in her lap, but the last decade and a half have been a grind. She left home in Jackson, Tenn., at 18 (\u201cbroke my mother\u2019s heart\u201d), married at 19 and, with her husband at the time, began performing as the duo Bella Sun, whose only official release was an album in 2004. The couple divorced soon after, and in 2009, June appeared on \u201c$5 Cover,\u201d an MTV documentary show that followed a different struggling Memphis musician in each episode. She had developed her multihyphen-descriptor style, but her career never quite took off. The pop-music industry had yet to segue to the more stampy, clappy, country-inflected acts like the Lumineers and Mumford & Sons, and June eventually relocated to Williamsburg, because, she says, it was halfway between Tennessee and Budapest, where her new husband is from. I first came across her through (where else do you discover a dreadlocked, banjolele-playing Tennessee warbler?) the Internet. In 2010, after releasing three short bootlegs, June \u2014 who in a video from this time deals tarot cards and bathes in tea \u2014 turned to Kickstarter to raise money for putting together a \u201creal\u201d album of what she called her \u201clittle ol\u2019 sound.\u201d         \n\nShortly after the Kickstarter campaign, though, June got a call from Kevin Augunas, who has produced records for the Lumineers. \u201cI just looked her up on YouTube and listened to a few things and saw her and was immediately totally intoxicated by it,\u201d he says. So he flew to Memphis two days later, where she played him \u201c20 or 30 songs\u201d while they drank wine on her friend\u2019s porch. \u201cI flew home the next morning,\u201d he recalls, \u201cand I was sitting there trying to think of ways to make a record for her.\u201d         \n\nAugunas introduced her to Dan Auerbach, the frontman of the Black Keys, and the duo set out to hone June\u2019s unusual sound without homogenizing it. They gave her studio space and found her some bandmates and collaborators like the legendary singer-songwriter Booker T. Jones. \u201cPushin\u2019 \u201d has more than a bit of the Black Keys\u2019 bluesy haze-rock fingerprints, but June\u2019s signature instrument is her voice, which isn\u2019t just different, it\u2019s strange. It\u2019s tinny but also yowly and scratchy, like Dolly Parton meets Nina Simone meets some kind of singing cat. She sometimes sings out of the side of her mouth in a warped \u201cO,\u201d eyes closed.         \n\nThe Internet often is accused of undercutting musicians, but June is an exception who has used her digital footprint \u2014 her YouTube fans, her Kickstarter contributors \u2014 to protect the very oddness that made her special in the first place. In the back room of RetroFret, filled with instruments of all ages in various states of repair, June looked on as the luthier showed her the correct way to replace the bridge on her banjo, so she could get back to her organic moonshine roots. \u201cThe reason I named my music something funny,\u201d she had told me, \u201cis because people will say what they want to say, and I want to just have it be a question mark when you walk into the world I\u2019m creating.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/magazine/williamsburg-appalachia-country-blues-goes-pop.html", "date": "2013-08-16", "description": "Valerie June is trying to bring a little Memphis to the people."}
