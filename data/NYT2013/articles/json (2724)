{"headline": "Who Made Speed Dating?", "body": "\nAt a matchmaking event he organized in 1998, Rabbi Yaacov Deyo brought along a  \n, the noisemaker Jews use during Purim. That night, in a Peet\u2019s Coffee & Tea in Beverly Hills, the Orthodox rabbi twirled his  \n to signal when it was time for the single men and women present to switch partners and spark up a conversation with the next stranger. \u201cWe thought 10 minutes for each date, because that was just an easier number to use in a busy coffeehouse,\u201d Deyo says. This entirely practical measure would inspire matchmakers all around the world \u2014 Jews and Gentiles alike.         \n\nWeeks before, Deyo invited a group of friends to convene in his living room and brainstorm about how he could best serve the local Jewish community. This being L.A., Deyo\u2019s group included several entertainment-industry people, including someone who produced game shows. The rabbi and his think tank decided that Jewish singles needed to identify marriage partners with maximum efficiency, and they designed a wacky game in which participants would table-hop their way through a dozen dates in a night. Soon they began their experiment (under the auspices of American Friends of Aish HaTorah, the nonprofit group that employed Deyo), using an Excel spreadsheet to keep track of the singles and their responses on feedback cards. Within a year or so, the speed-dating idea had gone viral, with imitators around the country.         \n\nSome of the knockoffs made Deyo uncomfortable. In 1999, Deyo was horrified by a TV program that hyped 30-second dates in which couples jabbered at each other like auctioneers. When he called the producers to complain, \u201cno one paid attention,\u201d and Deyo did not pursue the matter. \u201cIt was,\u201d he says, \u201cjust another case of rabbi meets the commercial-industrial complex.\u201d         \n\nAfter he and his friends trademarked SpeedDating, they began the process of filing a patent. But as the trend exploded, Deyo realized he had lost control of the idea. \u201cI don\u2019t want to spend the rest of my life writing letters to a roadhouse outside of Atlanta to tell them they can\u2019t do an event,\u201d he says. And so he decided to release it into the world. \u201cIn Judaism, there\u2019s a concept of  \n \u2014 the merit that is created by a good action,\u201d he says. In other words, it would be good karma to give away speed dating to anyone who wanted it, and \u2014 God willing \u2014 it would produce lots of marriages and babies. \u201cTo see your actions unfold in a good way makes for a happier existence,\u201d Deyo says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m a happy guy.\u201d         \n\n\u00a0         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n\u00a0The problem is that you get a random sample of people, the same as if you walked into a subway car and threw a dart. On Match.com, you might not meet as many people in a month, but you will get to choose those people. Online dating has better return on investment.         \n\n \nSaying that online dating sucks is like saying that the gym sucks because you\u2019re not losing any weight. It\u2019s great if you know how to use it. Of course, speed dating is good for practicing real-life interactions. It\u2019s another tool in the toolshed for my clients.         \n\n \n\u00a0People have tried. But it\u2019s hard to get honest feedback. Dating is way more personal than \u201cHey, I didn\u2019t like this book on Amazon.\u201d If I went out with someone three times and hooked up a bit, I might decide \u201cShe\u2019s O.K., but she\u2019s not the one.\u201d And that\u2019s fair. But she may report, \u201cHe used me.\u201d It\u2019s hard to prevent someone from coming home from a bad date and ripping someone a new one.         \n\n \n\u00a0On the one hand, technology flattens the world and gives us access to people everywhere, but it also makes us look past people or screen them out. We treat people as disposable. And that reminds me of another point in favor of speed dating: Online you might not go out with that 5-foot-9 guy, but if you\u2019re meeting him in person, you give him a chance.         \n\n \n\u00a0In the novel \u201cSuper Sad True Love Story,\u201d by Gary Shteyngart, the characters walk around with their social-media profile displayed on a necklace. It tells other people whether you\u2019re getting laid. I can\u2019t say I like it, but it feels inevitable.
