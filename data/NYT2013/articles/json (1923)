{"headline": "Tigers May Catch Themselves by the Tail ", "body": "\nDETROIT \u2014 With the  \n leading by seven runs in the sixth inning on Wednesday, a fan in a Justin Verlander jersey tried to start a wave in the center field stands. It petered out within two or three sections, and after several attempts, the fan sat down.         \n\nBut it was a bold idea, anyway, as if to symbolize that the Tigers were so much better than the Boston Red Sox, the fans did not even need to concentrate on the action in a playoff game. This city has some ownership over the wave, popularizing it in 1984 at Tiger Stadium, the enclosed, double-decker bandbox that was razed a few years ago.         \n\n\u201cHopefully they can do something and make it a beautiful site there and keep the memories going,\u201d said Lou Whitaker, the old second baseman, who threw out the first pitch at Comerica Park on Wednesday. \u201cThis is a beautiful stadium here.\u201d         \n\nSo it is, and the fans fill it every season, three million strong. These are glory days for the Tigers, with healthy superstars in their prime and another shot at the World Series. The Tigers pulled even with Boston in this American League Championship Series, two games apiece, in their 7-3 Game 4 romp.         \n\nBut it will not be like this forever. The Tigers need to win it all, and soon, to validate their successful run and satisfy a fan base starving for a title since Whitaker\u2019s 1984 champions. If not, these Tigers will be regarded with teams like the Cleveland Indians and the Seattle Mariners of the 1990s \u2014 full of elite players who could not win the big one.         \n\nManager  \n understands the urgency of the moment. Trailing by two games to one, he shuffled his lineup for Game 4 on Wednesday, moving Torii Hunter to the leadoff spot, Miguel Cabrera to second and Prince Fielder to third.         \n\nLeyland said he made the change mostly to find a new spot for the struggling Austin Jackson, who hit eighth for the first time in his career. But after scoring one run in Game 1 and none in Game 3, he also wanted a reaction.         \n\n\u201cIf nothing else, when guys look at the lineup card, they kind of look at it a little bit, and maybe it wakes you up a little bit,\u201d Leyland said. \u201cNot that they\u2019ve been sleeping; they\u2019ve been great games.\u00a0Just a little something to, you know, churn up the butter a little bit.\u201d         \n\nThe Red Sox had not hit much either, with a .133 average across the first three games. But Boston\u2019s top sluggers, David Ortiz and Mike Napoli, had pivotal home runs \u2014 Ortiz a grand slam to tie Game 2, Napoli a homer for the only run of Game 3. The Tigers needed comparable game-changing blows from their best run producers.         \n\nCabrera, dealing with an abdominal injury, was hitting .226, with two extra-base hits (both home runs, including a big one in the first-round clincher) this postseason. Fielder was hitting .276, with one extra-base hit, a double.         \n\nFielder went 0 for 4 in Game 4, and he still does not have a postseason run batted in since the opener of last year\u2019s A.L.C.S. at Yankee Stadium. But his continuing futility did not matter, because every other starter reached base.         \n\n\u201cA lot of people contributed tonight, and that was a good thing,\u201d Leyland said, after confirming he would use the same lineup in Game 5. \u201cEverybody doesn\u2019t break out. You\u2019re always seeing good pitching. It\u2019s not that easy. I think it\u2019s remarkable when you look at some of the batting averages from all the teams involved in the playoffs, and I\u2019m including the National League. It\u2019s pretty shocking sometimes.\u201d         \n\nThe Red Sox made it easier on the Tigers with fundamental mistakes. Jake Peavy walked three in the second inning, the last to force in a run. With Boston trailing by 1-0, Dustin Pedroia mishandled a double play ball that would have ended the inning; four more runs scored.         \n\nCabrera, Hunter and Jackson each drove in two runs. Jackson, who was 3 for 33 with 18 strikeouts this month before Game 4, had two singles, two walks and a stolen base.         \n\n\u201cI have no idea if I would have had the same type of game, being in that leadoff spot, trying to get things going at the top,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cSo I think that me moving down, it helped with just making me relax and be patient and just have fun, really.\u201d         \n\nJackson has never become a top base stealer, yet he has hit .278 over four years in Detroit while reducing his strikeout rate. His acquisition from the Yankees in December 2009, with Max Scherzer and Phil Coke in a three-way deal, was a crucial trade that has helped the Tigers reach this round three years in a row.         \n\nThey lost to the Texas Rangers in six games in 2011. They swept the Yankees last fall before losing the World Series in four to the San Francisco Giants. If they are going to make a return trip, they will have to do so this weekend at Fenway Park. Their legacy as a team is on the line.         \n\nAs players age, their production tends to decline and, in the case of the Tigers, their salaries rise. Fielder, who made $23 million this season while posting the lowest full-season O.P.S. of his career (.819), will earn $24 million in each of the next five years. Verlander makes $20 million this year and next, and $28 million in each of the four years after that.         \n\nScherzer, the likely A.L. Cy Young Award winner, is eligible for free agency after the 2014 season. Cabrera, the likely A.L. most valuable player, is up after 2015.         \n\nThe Tigers will face hard decisions and sobering realities soon enough. They need to cash in with a championship before then, and on Wednesday, their manager gave them their best shot.
