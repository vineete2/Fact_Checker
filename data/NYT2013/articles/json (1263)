{"headline": "The Best Beers of Winter", "body": "\nMaybe you also went through that phase. The one when you kept an eye on an ominous bucket in a dark corner of your kitchen until the time came to invite over friends, tap it and drink it. Maybe your friends also gulped it, smiled stiffly and said something like, \u201cIt\u2019s . . . interesting.\u201d And maybe they also grimaced as if they had just sucked down a rotten egg. I didn\u2019t blame them. The brown ale I concocted during my brief foray into home brewing was dreadful stuff \u2014 syrupy, unbalanced and weird.         \n\nI could accept that I had no inherent gifts in the beer-making department, but my failure put me off beer \u2014 at least the kind with flavor \u2014 for a long while. Sure, there\u2019s nothing like a cold beer on a hot summer day, but I don\u2019t want too much trouble. I want something light and pale and watery (and inexpensive) straight from a bottle: Corona or High Life or Rolling Rock suit me just fine. The same goes for when I eat Chinese or Mexican food, sausages and cabbage or anything Eastern European.         \n\nBut the bar where I work carries a great variety of beers, and so I\u2019ve had to reacquaint myself in order to answer my customers\u2019 questions. And what I\u2019ve discovered is that after a long absence, beer and I get along more than fine. My favorites \u2014 often from Central and Eastern Europe, where, for centuries, they\u2019ve known a thing or two about the craft of beer \u2014 are characterized by depth but not burdened by difficulty. There\u2019s a warm, slightly sweet, nutty, toasty character that many of them share \u2014 flavors that make them naturals for drinking in the winter, even for drinkers who normally think of summer when we think beer.         \n\nIt takes a lot to force me to forgo whiskey around this time of year, but some very special specimens, like Innis & Gunn\u2019s Oak-Aged Rum Cask Beer (strong stuff but reminiscent of cream soda), Allagash Black (a yeasty, Maine-made alternative to my usual Guinness) and those shown here, can make me do just that. Even an excellent, not-too-aggressive I.P.A., while not dark, has enough going on to win me over. These bottles aren\u2019t for chugging; they\u2019re for sipping, and the first one is satisfying enough to savor after dinner, with fruit and chocolate and good, sharp cheese. Beer has a place in mixed drinks, too, which \u2014 kicked up with spirits and laced with spice \u2014 can make for surprising and warming cocktails, like a Brown Corduroy.         \n\nIn July, sure, pass me a Corona. But a deep, dark beer on a cold winter\u2019s day? That\u2019s pretty refreshing, too.
