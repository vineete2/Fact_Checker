{"headline": "Billions in Debt, Detroit Tumbles Into Insolvency", "body": "\nDETROIT \u2014 Detroit, the cradle of America\u2019s automobile industry and once the nation\u2019s fourth-most-populous city, filed for bankruptcy on Thursday, the largest American city ever to take such a course.         \n\nThe decision, confirmed by officials after it trickled out in late afternoon news reports, also amounts to the largest municipal bankruptcy filing in American history in terms of debt.         \n\n\u201cThis is a difficult step, but the only viable option to address a problem that has been six decades in the making,\u201d said Gov. Rick Snyder, who authorized the move after a recommendation from the emergency financial manager he had appointed to resolve Detroit\u2019s dire financial situation.         \n\nNot everyone agrees how much Detroit owes, but Kevyn D. Orr, the emergency manager, has said the debt is likely to be $18 billion and perhaps as much as $20 billion.         \n\nFor Detroit, the filing came as a painful reminder of a city\u2019s rise and fall.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad, but you could see the writing on the wall,\u201d said Terence Tyson, a city worker who learned of the bankruptcy as he left his job at Detroit\u2019s municipal building on Thursday evening. Like many there, he seemed to react with muted resignation and uncertainty about what lies ahead, but not surprise. \u201cThis has been coming for ages.\u201d         \n\nDetroit expanded at a stunning rate in the first half of the 20th century with the arrival of the automobile industry, and then shrank away in recent decades at a similarly remarkable pace. A city of 1.8 million in 1950, it is now home to 700,000 people, as well as to tens of thousands of abandoned buildings, vacant lots and unlit streets.         \n\nFrom here, there is no road map for Detroit\u2019s recovery, not least of all because municipal bankruptcies are rare. State officials said ordinary city business would carry on as before, even as city leaders take their case to a judge, first to prove that the city is so financially troubled as to be eligible for bankruptcy, and later to argue that Detroit\u2019s creditors and representatives of city workers and municipal retirees ought to settle for less than they once expected.         \n\nSome bankruptcy experts and city leaders bemoaned the likely fallout from the filing, including the stigma. They anticipate further benefit cuts for city workers and retirees, more reductions in services for residents, and a detrimental effect on borrowing.         \n\n\u201cFor a struggling family I can see bankruptcy, but for a big city like this, can it really work?\u201d said Diane Robinson, an office assistant who has worked for the city for 20 years. \u201cWhat will happen to city retirees on fixed incomes?\u201d         \n\nBut others, including some Detroit business leaders who have seen a rise in private investment downtown despite the city\u2019s larger struggles, said bankruptcy seemed the only choice left \u2014 and one that might finally lead to a desperately needed overhaul of city services and to a plan to pay off some reduced version of the overwhelming debts. In short, a new start.         \n\n\u201cThe worst thing we can do is ignore a problem,\u201d said Sandy K. Baruah, president of the Detroit Regional Chamber. \u201cWe\u2019re finally executing a fix.\u201d         \n\nThe decision to go to court signaled a breakdown after weeks of tense negotiations, in which Mr. Orr had been trying to persuade creditors to accept pennies on the dollar and unions to accept cuts in benefits.         \n\nAll along, the state\u2019s involvement \u2014 including Mr. Snyder\u2019s decision to send in an emergency manager \u2014 has carried racial implications, setting off a wave of concerns for some in Detroit that the mostly white Republican-led state government was trying to seize control of Detroit, a Democratic city where more than 80 percent of residents are black.         \n\nThe nature of Detroit\u2019s situation ensures that it will be watched intensely by the municipal bond market, by public sector unions, and by leaders of other financially challenged cities around the country. Just over 60 cities, towns, villages and counties have  \n, the court proceeding used by municipalities, since the mid-1950s.         \n\nLeaders in Washington and in Lansing, the state capital, issued statements of concern late Thursday. A White House spokeswoman said President Obama and his senior team were closely monitoring the situation.
