{"headline": "Making Pasta Look Pretty in Pink", "body": "\nI\u2019ve had pasta with red sauce hundreds of times; it\u2019s classic, comforting and exactly what you\u2019d expect to coat your linguine. But this autumn\u2019s crop of jewel-like beets has me thinking in an entirely different direction. These days when I make pasta, I think pink: pink beet sauce, that is.         \n\nIt isn\u2019t something you come across very often. The first time I had it was at Al Di La in Brooklyn, where the chef Anna Klinger fills her casunziei, which are tender ravioli, with ricotta cheese and pur\u00e9ed beets. They are served with a buttery sauce darkened with poppy seeds. It\u2019s a brilliant combination of flavors: assertively sweet and earthy from the beets, delicately milky from the ricotta, rich from the butter.         \n\nI\u2019ve since adapted the dish to my own lazier disposition. This means instead of making labor intensive homemade ravioli, I turn the filling of beets and ricotta into a magenta sauce.         \n\nThe easiest way to deal with the beets, I\u2019ve found, is not to roast and pur\u00e9e them. This can take hours. Instead I like to grate and saut\u00e9 them, which is accomplished in under 20 minutes.         \n\nAlthough it\u2019s not strictly necessary, a food processor (if you have one) is worth using for grating. Not only does it make the task quicker, it also makes the effort far less messy, restraining the beet juices instead of letting them spill all over your counter, cutting board and fingers.         \n\nThen I saut\u00e9 the beets in loads of nutty brown butter until they absorb all the butter and practically fall apart. This forms the basis of the sauce.         \n\nBecause beets don\u2019t have the tanginess of tomatoes, it\u2019s vital to include a little acid in the mix; otherwise, everything seems too heavy and stodgy. Here I drizzle on balsamic vinegar and spike the ricotta with orange zest. Lemon or lime work equally well.         \n\nAs a final touch, I sprinkle the dish with chopped pistachios, which lend the same nutty crunch as the poppy seeds in Ms. Klinger\u2019s sauce, but with the added appeal of the pale green color. Use any kind of nut or seed that you like, or leave them off altogether.         \n\nWhatever you do, play around and make this beet sauce your own. After all, there are about as many red sauce recipes as there are cooks making red sauce. But not so much when it comes to pink.
