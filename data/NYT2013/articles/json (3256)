{"headline": "Selling That New-Man Feeling", "body": "\nOne afternoon a few months ago, a 45-year-old sales representative named Mike called  \n a weekly men\u2019s health program on the Howard Stern channel on Sirius XM Radio, where no male medical or sexual issue goes unexplored.         \n\n\u201cI feel like a 70-year-old man in a 45-year-old body,\u201d Mike, from Vancouver, British Columbia, told Dr. Fisch on the live broadcast. \u201cI want to feel good. I don\u2019t want to feel tired all day.\u201d         \n\nA regular listener, Mike had heard  \n and fertility specialist, talk about a phenomenon called \u201clow  \n\u201d or \u201clow T.\u201d Dr. Fisch likes to say that a man\u2019s testosterone level is \u201cthe dipstick\u201d of his health; he regularly appears on programs like \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d to talk about the  \n that may coincide with low testosterone. He is also the medical expert  \n an informational website sponsored by AbbVie, the drug maker behind AndroGel, the best-selling prescription testosterone gel.         \n\nLike many men who have seen that site or commercials or online quizzes about \u201clow T,\u201d Mike suspected that diminished testosterone was the cause of his  \n. And he hoped, as the marketing campaigns seem to suggest, that taking a prescription testosterone drug would make him feel more energetic.         \n\n\u201cI took your advice and I went and got my testosterone checked,\u201d Mike told Dr. Fisch. Mike\u2019s own physician, he related, told him that his testosterone \u201cwas a little low\u201d and prescribed a testosterone medication.         \n\nMike also said he had  \n and  \n and was 40 pounds overweight. Dr. Fisch explained that conditions like  \n might be accompanied by decreased testosterone and energy, and he urged Mike to  \n more and to lose weight. But if Mike had trouble overhauling his diet and exercise habits, Dr. Fisch said, taking testosterone might give him the boost he needed to do so.         \n\n\u201cIf it gives you more energy to exercise,\u201d Dr. Fisch said of the testosterone drug, \u201cI\u2019m all for it.\u201d         \n\nRecommendations like Dr. Fisch\u2019s and the marketing of low T as a common medical condition helped propel sales of testosterone gels, patches, injections and tablets to about $2 billion in the United States last year, according to IMS Health, a health care information company. In 2002, sales were reported to be a mere $324 million; around that time, Solvay Pharmaceuticals, which was then marketing AndroGel, began using the term \u201clow T,\u201d replacing a previous euphemism for male aging, \u201candropause.\u201d Today the low-T trend is global. From 2000 to 2011, there was \u201ca major and progressive increase\u201d in testosterone use in 37 countries, according to  \n in the Medical Journal of Australia.         \n\nThis marketing juggernaut is running into mounting opposition from some prominent medical researchers and industry experts. They contend that the pharmaceutical industry has vastly expanded the market for testosterone drugs to many men who may not need them and may be exposed to increased health risks by taking them. And drug makers have done so, these critics say, by exploiting loopholes in federal marketing regulations.         \n\nDrug makers spent $107 million last year to advertise the top brand-name testosterone drugs in the United States, according to Kantar Media. That amount doesn\u2019t include marketing known as unbranded campaigns, which raise awareness of low T itself. The  \n closely regulates advertisements for brand-name prescription drugs, but does not generally regulate unbranded campaigns. That two-track system, says John Mack, an analyst who runs a blog called  \n, has enabled companies to position low T as a malady with such amorphous symptoms \u2014 listlessness, increased body fat and moodiness \u2014 that it can be seen to afflict nearly all men, at least once in a while. Drug makers also promote low-T screening quizzes directly to consumers, Mr. Mack says, in an effort to prompt men to seek testosterone prescriptions from their doctors.         \n\n\u201cYou might not have the medical condition as described in the textbook,\u201d Mr. Mack explains. \u201cBut you may have low T as defined by marketing quizzes, and you go to the doctor and ask for treatment.\u201d         \n\nDavid Freundel, a spokesman for AbbVie, declined requests to interview company executives. In a statement, Mr. Freundel wrote: \u201cAndroGel is approved by the F.D.A. to treat adult men with low or no testosterone ( \n) who have been diagnosed by a physician, and has more than 10 years of clinical, safety, published and post-marketing data.\u201d He added that the company continues to finance research into the long-term effects of testosterone therapy and that its unbranded informational efforts, like the  \n site, \u201cfollow F.D.A.\u2019s guidance.\u201d         \n\nNevertheless, some public health experts warn that the popularization of testosterone drugs is outpacing research into efficacy and possible harms. The drugs\u2019 labels warn users about the  \n,  \n and low sperm counts; the  \n that women and children exposed to the substances could develop male characteristics like chest hair. Others have raised concerns about the potential for  \n and heart attacks.         \n\n\u201cThe big thing is, we just don\u2019t know the long-term risk of testosterone therapy at this time,\u201d says Jacques G. Baillargeon, an epidemiologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston who has  \n in the United States. \u201cIt\u2019s particularly concerning when you see the dramatic increase happening at such a large scale so quickly.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nIn a TV commercial promoting awareness of \u201clow T,\u201d the shadow of a middle-age man sits on a bench watching his friends play basketball in an indoor gym.         \n\n\u201cFeeling like a shadow of your former self? Don\u2019t have the hops for hoops with your buddies?\u201d says the voice-over for the spot, paid for by AbbVie and currently posted on the IsItLowT site. \u201cYou might have a treatable condition called low testosterone or low T.\u201d         \n\nA few seconds later, presumably after the man is treated with testosterone, the shadow evaporates and a man materializes in the flesh, besuited and smiling. Cue the voice-over: \u201cStep out of the shadows.\u201d         \n\nTestosterone, which plays a central role in the development of the male sexual organs, as well as muscle and body hair, has long been a synonym for youthful vigor and virility. And the quest to stave off aging by manipulating the hormone is an old business.         \n\nToward the end of the 19th century, Charles-\u00c9douard Brown-S\u00e9quard, a French physiologist, began injecting himself with \u201cjuice\u201d extracted from crushed dog or guinea-pig testicles, as  \n. Although he contended that the injections were rejuvenating, subsequent researchers came to believe that the placebo effect was at work.         \n\nIn the 1920s and \u201930s, surgeons began transplanting monkey and goat testes into men, says  \n, the director of endocrinology and geriatrics at the Saint Louis University School of Medicine. But that fad ended quickly after  \n implanted goat testicles into his patients, where they apparently emitted a noxious odor.         \n\n\u201cThis is the hilarious history of testosterone,\u201d recounts Dr. Morley, who in the past received speaking fees or consulting fees from drug makers that marketed testosterone treatments or planned to do so. \u201cIt may not have gotten any better. But, gee whiz, it was crazy.\u201d         \n\nResearchers were eventually  \n testosterone, and drug makers capitalized on the discovery by using it to develop medical treatments.         \n\nThe classic endocrine disorder for which testosterone drugs were originally developed and federally approved  \n. That condition can be caused by problems like undescended testicles or a tumor in the pituitary gland, typically resulting in severe testosterone deficiency, along with poor libido, minimal muscles and scant body hair. \u201cThat is the real hypogonadal patient,\u201d says  \n at Newcastle University in Britain, \u201cnot the overweight businessman whose erections aren\u2019t as good as they used to be.\u201d         \n\nIn fact, physicians weren\u2019t precisely quantifying men\u2019s testosterone levels until the 1960s, after the development of sensitive tests to determine the concentration of different hormones in blood samples. These enabled researchers to record men\u2019s testosterone levels over time. Dr. Morley and others have reported that, after age 30, men\u2019s testosterone levels typically  \n a year. To the pharmaceutical industry, that decline was ripe for treatment.
