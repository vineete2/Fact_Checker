{"headline": "Roseanne Barr and Mindy Kaling: Funny Women, Serious Talk", "body": "\nON A RECENT Saturday, the weather California-perfect, Roseanne Barr, the star and co-creator of the groundbreaking sitcom \u201cRoseanne,\u201d which ran on ABC from October 1988 to May 1997 (and now \n), and Mindy Kaling, the TV writer and actress (\u201cThe Office\u201d), best-selling author (\u201cIs Everybody Hanging Out Without Me?\u201d) and now the creator and star of \u201c \n\u201d on Fox, met for lunch at the Hotel Bel-Air in Los Angeles.         \n\nArriving a few minutes before the noon reservation, Ms. Barr excused herself to walk around the recently renovated property. (\u201cThe regulars hate it,\u201d a woman sniffed as Ms. Barr passed.) Ms. Kaling arrived shortly afterward, and as the two headed to the dining room, they passed a swarm of giddy young women with large fancy-dress bags slung over their arms, none of whom seemed to recognize the celebrities in their midst. \u201cSomeone\u2019s getting married,\u201d Ms. Kaling said.         \n\nAs they took their seats, the two were informed that their table was one usually reserved for Nancy Reagan when she dined there, an observation that prompted a brief discussion about whether either had ever harbored a desire to be first lady. \u201cI\u2019d rather be president,\u201d Ms. Barr said. (In fact, Ms. Barr ran for president in 2012.) Then, over loup de mer (for Ms. Barr) and steak frites (for Ms. Kaling), they chatted about women in comedy, their romantic relationships and a shared obsession with true-crime television.         \n\n \n This year marks the 25th anniversary of the \u201cRoseanne\u201d show, with 22 million people watching every week.         \n\n \n Excuse me! It was 40 million people. But there were only four networks back then.         \n\n \n And no reality shows.         \n\n \n I saw Roseanne for the first time on Johnny Carson, doing your \u201cDomestic Goddess\u201d routine. It was so fresh and funny about women and family. Were you surprised when a network wanted to make a sitcom about your life?         \n\n \n Well, first of all, nobody wanted it.         \n\n \nWhat?         \n\n \nNobody wanted the \u201cRoseanne\u201d show. I heard from agents that there was no interest in a show about a fat woman and her family. It wasn\u2019t until [the producers] Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner got involved. They wanted to do a show about a working mom, and they were the ones who sold it to ABC.         \n\n \n And you started as a writer for \u201cThe Office.\u201d Correct, Mindy?         \n\n \nYes, I wrote a play [\u201c \n,\u201d about Matt Damon and Ben Affleck], and then I was a writer and an actor on \u201cThe Office.\u201d But I knew if I was going to have my own show, I\u2019d have to do it myself. Because no one is going to write a show for a chubby brown woman. It\u2019s hard enough to make it if you\u2019re a thin, conventionally attractive woman. I also knew I was only going to be good at certain things.         \n\n \nLike what you think is funny.         \n\n \n So I just thought: I\u2019ll do it myself.         \n\n \n Can we get some coffee? I need to wake up.         \n\n \n Were you out partying last night?         \n\n \n No! I\u2019m too old for partying. My partying is sitting around, eating these awesome See\u2019s Butterscotch Lollypops and watching forensic murder shows for 12 hours a day.         \n\n \n I love murder shows.         \n\n \nLike \u201cCSI\u201d?         \n\n \n No, I like true crime, the ID channel. I\u2019m a complete ID addict. They\u2019ve got a new show called \u201cElder Skelter.\u201d It\u2019s about old grandmas that kill their families. And the one before that was \u201cWives With Knives.\u201d That was unbelievable.         \n\n \nI also go to  \n because I love reading about true crime. There must be some connection between women in comedy and true crime.         \n\n \nLike what?         \n\n \nFor me, it\u2019s a little narcissistic. All I do is work, so I have this narcissistic idea that somebody is thinking about me and wants to kill me.         \n\n \n I have that, too.         \n\n \nHave you ever pitched a sitcom about a crime solver?         \n\n \n I wouldn\u2019t want to see that as a comedy show. I think the reason I like it is that it\u2019s the opposite of my skill set.         \n\n \n I bet you could make that funny.         \n\n \nI couldn\u2019t. Roseanne could. She can do anything.         \n\n \n I almost pitched a \u201cColumbo\u201d-like thing because I thought it would be fun to play a character that everyone thinks is dumb, but in the end, you\u2019re as smart as Columbo. But I don\u2019t have great follow-through.         \n\n \n That surprises me.         \n\n \nWell, after \u201cRoseanne,\u201d when I pretty much lived in a big concrete building for 10 years, I needed to get used to the world again. And I\u2019m reluctant to be so consumed again.         \n\n \nCould you ever go back to that rigorous network schedule?         \n\n \n I don\u2019t think so. The ideal thing for me would be a show with just six or eight episodes. Like  \n does in the U.K. But nobody wants to do that here.         \n\n \n You also had to fight for your voice on \u201cRoseanne.\u201d Is that another reason it was so draining?         \n\n \n Not really. My big fight ended after the first 13 episodes, and I did 222 of them. I had no real problems after that initial one.         \n\n \n Because the show was so successful?         \n\n \n No, because the person I was fighting with [head writer, Matt Williams] left. And I\u2019m sure it was made easier by the show\u2019s being No. 3 [in popularity] in its second week, then No. 1.         \n\n \nDo you have to fight a lot, Mindy? It\u2019s hard to imagine fighting on top of writing, producing and starring.
