{"headline": "Selling a New Generation on Guns", "body": "\nThreatened by long-term declining participation in shooting sports, the firearms industry has poured millions of dollars into a broad campaign to ensure its future by getting guns into the hands of more, and younger, children.         \n\nThe industry\u2019s strategies include giving firearms, ammunition and cash to youth groups; weakening state restrictions on hunting by young children; marketing an affordable military-style rifle for \u201cjunior shooters\u201d and sponsoring semiautomatic-handgun competitions for youths; and developing a target-shooting video game that promotes brand-name weapons, with links to the Web sites of their makers.         \n\nThe pages of Junior Shooters, an industry-supported magazine that seeks to get children involved in the recreational use of firearms, once featured a smiling 15-year-old girl clutching a semiautomatic rifle. At the end of an accompanying article that extolled target shooting with a Bushmaster AR-15 \u2014 an advertisement elsewhere in the magazine directed readers to a coupon for buying one \u2014 the author encouraged youngsters to share the article with a parent.         \n\n\u201cWho knows?\u201d it said. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll find a Bushmaster AR-15 under  \ntree some frosty Christmas morning!\u201d         \n\nThe industry\u2019s youth-marketing effort is backed by extensive social research and is carried out by an array of nonprofit groups financed by the gun industry, an examination by The New York Times found. The campaign picked up steam about five years ago with the completion of a major study that urged a stronger emphasis on the \u201crecruitment and retention\u201d of new hunters and target shooters.         \n\nThe overall objective was summed up in another study, commissioned last year by the shooting sports industry, that suggested encouraging children experienced in firearms to recruit other young people. The report, which focused on children ages 8 to 17, said these \u201cpeer ambassadors\u201d should help introduce wary youngsters to guns slowly, perhaps through paintball, archery or some other less intimidating activity.         \n\n\u201cThe point should be to get newcomers started shooting something, with the natural next step being a move toward actual firearms,\u201d said the report, which was prepared for the  \n and the  \n.         \n\nFirearms manufacturers and their two primary surrogates, the National Rifle Association of America and the National Shooting Sports Foundation, have long been associated with high-profile battles to fend off efforts at gun control and to widen access to firearms. The public debate over the mass shootings in Newtown, Conn., and elsewhere has focused largely on the availability of guns, along with mental illness and the influence of violent video games.         \n\nLittle attention has been paid, though, to the industry\u2019s youth-marketing initiatives. They stir passionate views, with proponents arguing that introducing children to guns can provide a safe and healthy pastime, and critics countering that it fosters a corrosive gun culture and is potentially dangerous.         \n\nThe N.R.A. has for decades given grants for youth shooting programs, mostly to Boy Scout councils and 4-H groups, which traditionally involved single-shot rimfire rifles, BB guns and archery. Its $21 million in total grants in 2010 was nearly double what it gave out five years earlier.         \n\nNewer initiatives by other organizations go further, seeking to introduce children to high-powered rifles and handguns while invoking the same rationale of those older, more traditional programs: that firearms can teach \u201clife skills\u201d like responsibility, ethics and citizenship. And the gun industry points to injury statistics that it says show a greater likelihood of getting hurt cheerleading or playing softball than using firearms for fun and sport.         \n\nStill, some experts in child psychiatry say that encouraging youthful exposure to guns, even in a structured setting with an emphasis on safety, is asking for trouble. Dr. Jess P. Shatkin, the director of undergraduate studies in child and adolescent mental health at New York University, said that young people are naturally impulsive and that their brains \u201care engineered to take risks,\u201d making them ill suited for handling guns.         \n\n\u201cThere are lots of ways to teach responsibility to a kid,\u201d Dr. Shatkin said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a gun to do it.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/us/selling-a-new-generation-on-guns.html", "date": "2013-01-26", "description": "Long-term declining participation in shooting sports has prompted gun makers and sellers to pour millions into a campaign to get firearms into the hands of children."}
