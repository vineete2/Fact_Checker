{"headline": "Benefits Ending for One Million Unemployed", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 An emergency federal program that acts as a lifeline for 1.3 million jobless workers will end on Saturday, drastically curtailing government support for the long-term unemployed and setting the stage for a major political fight in the new year.         \n\nThe program, in place since the recession started in 2008, provides up to 47 weeks of supplemental unemployment insurance payments to jobless people looking for work. Its expiration is expected to have far-reaching ramifications for the economy, cutting job growth by about 300,000 positions next year and pushing hundreds of thousands of households below the poverty line.         \n\nAn extension of the unemployment program did not make it into the two-year budget deal that was passed just before Congress left on its winter recess. When the federal program expires, just one in four unemployed Americans will receive jobless benefits \u2014 the smallest proportion in half a century.         \n\n\u201cI really depend on unemployment,\u201d said David Davis of Chantilly, Va., adding that the $1,600 a month he receives is helping keep him afloat while he interviews for new positions. \u201cI\u2019ve got a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that knocks your socks off. The reason for this long period of unemployment is that the work just isn\u2019t there.\u201d         \n\nAt one point, Mr. Davis, 68, made more than $100,000 a year as an information technology expert and web designer. He is now living on ramen noodles and $140 he counted out from his change jar. Since being laid off over the summer, he has missed mortgage payments, forcing him to take out a reverse mortgage on his home. He sold his car and got a late-1990s model Ford Taurus, and is looking to cut his utility and cellphone bills. Soon, he might start taking  \n.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very stressful,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cAt least I\u2019ve had the ability to maneuver my finances so I don\u2019t wind up homeless. That\u2019s one goal, to avoid living on the street or in my car.\u201d         \n\nDemocrats on Capitol Hill are pushing for an extension of the program, though the constrained fiscal environment makes its reinstatement somewhat less likely, aides said. Members of the Republican leadership have indicated that they might be willing to extend the benefits, but only if Democrats offset the new spending with other cuts.         \n\nOn Friday morning, President Obama called Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, and Senator Dean Heller, Republican of Nevada, to extend his support for their proposal to extend emergency unemployment benefits for three months.         \n\n\u201cThe president said his administration would, as it has for several weeks now, push Congress to act promptly and in bipartisan fashion to address this urgent economic priority,\u201d said Josh Earnest, a White House spokesman.         \n\nAs the last payments are distributed, Democrats have initiated a campaign aimed at shaming Republicans \u2014 particularly those in leadership and in swing districts \u2014 for letting the program expire over the holiday season.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if our colleagues who have opposed passing the unemployment-insurance legislation know or care about the impact on families,\u201d said Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader. \u201cThe impact is very, very strong. It hurts the dignity of a family, of a worker.\u201d         \n\n \n, a liberal group, is running an advertisement on cable television stations. \u201cYou know who had a Merry Christmas? The richest 1 percent, that\u2019s who. Republicans in Congress made sure of that, protecting billions in taxpayer giveaways,\u201d it says. \u201cFor those facing tough times? Republicans stripped 1.3 million Americans of jobless benefits \u2014 folks who want to work, but cannot find a job \u2014 kicking them to the curb during Christmas.\u201d         \n\nRepublican aides said they remained willing to negotiate. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t they offer a plan that met the speaker\u2019s requirements \u2014 fiscally responsible, with something to create jobs \u2014 or any plan, for that matter, before they left for the holidays?\u201d asked Michael Steel, a spokesman for John A. Boehner of Ohio, the speaker of the House.         \n\nSome Democrats have suggested that continuing the program for three months, with the estimated $6 billion in spending offsets coming from agricultural subsidies in the  \n.         \n\nBut some conservatives have shown stauncher opposition.         \n\n\u201cI do support unemployment benefits for the 26 weeks that they\u2019re paid for,\u201d said Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky on Fox News. \u201cIf you extend it beyond that, you do a disservice to these workers. When you allow people to be on unemployment insurance for 99 weeks, you\u2019re causing them to become part of this perpetual unemployed group in our economy.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/28/us/benefits-ending-for-one-million-of-unemployed.html", "date": "2013-12-27", "description": "A federal emergency program, in place since 2008, had provided up to 47 weeks of supplemental unemployment insurance payments to jobless Americans looking for work."}
