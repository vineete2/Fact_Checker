{"headline": "White House Tactic for C.I.A. Bid Holds Back Drone Memos", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The White House is refusing to share fully with Congress the legal opinions that justify targeted killings, while maneuvering to make sure its stance does not do anything to endanger the confirmation of  \n as  \n director.         \n\nRather than agreeing to some Democratic senators\u2019 demands for full access to the classified legal memos on the targeted killing program, Obama administration officials are negotiating with Republicans to provide more information on the lethal attack last year on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, according to three Congressional staff members.         \n\nThe strategy is intended to produce a bipartisan majority vote for Mr. Brennan in the Senate Intelligence Committee without giving its members seven additional legal opinions on targeted killing sought by senators and while protecting what the White House views as the confidentiality of the Justice Department\u2019s legal advice to the president. It would allow Mr. Brennan\u2019s nomination to go to the Senate floor even if one or two Democrats vote no to protest the refusal to share more legal memos.         \n\nAt issue is the critical question of how Congress conducts oversight of a shadow war against people suspected of being terrorists. The administration routinely reports on its lethal drone strikes to both the Senate and the House Intelligence and Armed Services Committees, but it has long rebuffed Congressional attempts to see the legal opinions that authorize the strikes \u2014 let alone requests to make them public.         \n\nOnly after an unclassified Justice Department white paper summarizing the legal arguments was leaked to NBC News this month did the administration make two legal opinions on the targeted killing of American citizens briefly available to members of the Intelligence Committees.         \n\nBut the documents were available to be viewed only for a limited time and only by senators themselves, not their lawyers and experts.         \n\nThe arrangement frustrated members of the committee, who were not allowed to have their staff members study the highly complex legal opinions. But the reinvigorated public discussion set off by the nomination of Mr. Brennan has raised hopes in Congress that the debate will continue even if he is confirmed.         \n\nThe refusal so far to share more of the opinions with Congress, or to make redacted versions of the memos public, comes despite a pledge of greater transparency by  \n in his  \n on Feb. 12.         \n\n\u201cI recognize that in our democracy, no one should just take my word that we\u2019re doing things the right way,\u201d the president said. \u201cSo, in the months ahead, I will continue to engage with Congress to ensure not only that our targeting, detention and prosecution of terrorists remains consistent with our laws and system of checks and balances, but that our efforts are even more transparent to the American people and to the world.\u201d         \n\nThe chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, has long called for all Justice Department legal opinions on intelligence to go to the committee. But a spokesman said she did not believe the issue should block Mr. Brennan\u2019s confirmation.         \n\nThe votes of at least two other Democratic senators who feel strongly about greater access to the legal opinions, Ron Wyden of Oregon and Mark Udall of Colorado, are less certain.         \n\n\u201cI still have a number of unanswered questions about the president\u2019s authority to kill Americans who are deemed to be a threat to the United States,\u201d Mr. Wyden said.         \n\nHe said that he was \u201cencouraged\u201d by Mr. Obama\u2019s promise of greater transparency in the State of the Union address but that \u201cthe administration has not yet lived up to that commitment.\u201d         \n\nThe administration is currently in discussions with Republican members of the Intelligence Committee about providing the trail of e-mails that were the basis of \u201ctalking points\u201d from the intelligence agencies regarding the Sept. 11 attack in Benghazi, which killed the American ambassador to Libya, J. Christopher Stevens, and three other Americans. Such a concession would probably win at least some Republican votes for Mr. Brennan.         \n\nBy most accounts, Mr. Brennan is likely to be confirmed as director of the C.I.A., in part because some human rights advocates who were once deeply skeptical about his record are now ambivalent.
