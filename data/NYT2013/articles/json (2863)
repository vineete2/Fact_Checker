{"headline": "Rivals Unite in Jordan\u2019s Surprising World Cup Run", "body": "\nAMMAN, Jordan \u2014 Jordan\u2019s royal past, present and future look down on the grass field at Amman International Stadium from all angles. Below huge color portraits of King Abdullah II, his father, King Hussein, and his teenage son, the crown prince, the national soccer team\u2019s players trained Tuesday ahead of the game of their lives: a World Cup intercontinental playoff against Uruguay, the South American champion, on Wednesday night.         \n\n\u201cThis is the biggest match we have had in our history \u2014 that is the reality,\u201d Prince Ali bin al-Hussein, the king\u2019s brother and the president of the Jordan Football Association, said as he sat along the edge of the field pointing out promising players.         \n\n\u201cWe are on the verge of qualifying for the World Cup,\u201d he added, still sounding a little surprised.         \n\nJordan\u2019s team, known as al Nashama, or the Brave, has never qualified for the tournament. It has not even been close. Now it is two games away, a home-and-home series with, possibly, an unprecedented reward.         \n\n\u201cJordan is a country that has very limited resources,\u201d said Prince Ali, who is also a FIFA vice president. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the financial means. It is the emotion that has got us to that level.\u201d         \n\nIts  \n began in July 2011 with a 9-0 shellacking of Nepal, and continued with its first trip to the final group stage of Asian qualification. Along the way, Jordan beat the former Asian champions Japan, China, Australia and Iraq before overcoming Uzbekistan, 9-8, in a tense penalty shootout in Tashkent. The reward was the playoff that opens Wednesday.         \n\nBut the team\u2019s success has been a surprise on another level, too.         \n\nSoccer in Jordan has long been as emblematic of Jordan\u2019s divisions as of its unity. After a series of regional wars with Israel, waves of  \n refugees settled in Jordan. They now make up a majority of the population, with the ethnically Jordanian East Bankers a minority in what they view as their country.         \n\n\u201cThe Jordanian authorities consider any talk about a Palestinian-East Bank Jordanian division to be a threat to national security,\u201d said Yasir Suleiman,  \n. \u201cEast Bank Jordanians tend to be more vocal about the issue publicly: they feel that they are the indigenous population and that the state is more theirs than the Palestinians\u2019.\u201d         \n\nBecause of its delicate nature, the issue is rarely mentioned in the local news media. One of the only spheres where it enters the public realm is in the local soccer league, when Jordan\u2019s two biggest teams \u2014 al-Wihdat, which is aligned with the Palestinian population, and al-Faisaly, which has roots in the country\u2019s Jordanian population \u2014 \u00a0play each other. Abusive chants and rioting at the teams\u2019 games have been commonplace in recent years.         \n\n\u201cIn the heat of the game, where large crowds gather, repressed feelings may be vented in the public sphere,\u201d Suleiman said. \u201cAuthorities know this, but as long as the vents are not overloaded, they tend to tolerate the political in football.\u201d         \n\nBut one such vent went too far after a particularly heated encounter in 2009. The incident even made it to the diplomatic level. A United States State Department cable released by the WikiLeaks website titled, \u201c \n,\u201d detailed how a match in July 2009 was abandoned with the score at 0-0 amid chants denouncing King Abdullah and his Palestinian wife, Queen Rania.         \n\n\u201cThere is broad recognition throughout Jordan that the Faisali-Wahdat incident exposed the uncomfortable gap between East Bankers and Palestinians,\u201d the cable said. \u201cOne that most would rather keep well hidden for the sake of political stability.\u201d         \n\nJordan\u2019s national team has often been built around Wihdat and Faisaly players, which makes the national team\u2019s achievements this year even more remarkable. The most recent roster includes a half-dozen players from the two clubs, though team officials did not make any available to discuss the rivalry, or anything else, on Tuesday.         \n\n\u201cThey are rivals on the pitch, but I think the rivalry has helped us because there\u2019s so much emotion behind it,\u201d Prince Ali said.         \n\nIt is common for national soccer teams to become symbols of unity in times of division. Iraq won the 2007 Asian Cup with a squad of Sunni, Shia and Kurdish players in the darkest days of that country\u2019s sectarian violence, and the team\u2019s victory sparked the first large-scale outpouring of nationalistic celebration since the fall of Saddam Hussein. The Palestinian national team has long been used as a bridge between the West Bank and Gaza, and in the last days of the Libyan civil war, talented players who had joined the rebel fighters against Muammar el Gaddafi were pulled off the front line and sent to play a vital Africa Cup of Nations qualifier in Zambia. The transitional government believed that qualification, and with it a chance to fly a new flag and sing a new national anthem, was more important.         \n\nJordan\u2019s coach, the former Egypt international Hossam Hassan, has long experienced the fires of rivalry in his homeland. He is one of the few players to have played for both al Ahly and Zamalek, Cairo\u2019s two most popular teams. That rivalry also shares a bloody and at times political history.         \n\n\u201cIt is like in Spain with Barcelona and Real Madrid \u2014 there\u2019s a rivalry, but now we are all together in the national team,\u201d Hassan said. \u201cWe are all Arabs under Allah.\u201d         \n\nOutside the stadium after Jordan\u2019s practice, a few hundred fans began to chant, this time in the royal family\u2019s honor. Prince Ali greeted the leader of the supporters\u2019 group, who stood on a metal fence leading the crowd in patriotic songs.         \n\n\u201cTomorrow, there will be no Faisaly, no Wihdat,\u201d Khaled Ziqawe, a 29-year-old bank clerk said, wiping tears from his eyes after his brush with royalty. \u201cThe Arab world will be behind us and, tomorrow, al Nashama will be one team, all the people from Jordan will come together. Even Wihdat and Faisaly.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/13/sports/soccer/rivals-unite-in-jordans-surprising-world-cup-run.html", "date": "2013-11-12", "description": "Jordan\u2019s soccer team is two games from qualifying for the World Cup with a roster that reflects the country\u2019s schism between East Bank Jordanians and citizens of Palestinian origin."}
