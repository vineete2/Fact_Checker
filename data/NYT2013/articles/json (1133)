{"headline": "Subtract Teachers, Add Pupils: Math of Today\u2019s Jammed Schools", "body": "\nCOATESVILLE, Pa. \u2014 The recession may have ended, but many of the nation\u2019s school districts that laid off teachers and other employees to cut payrolls in leaner times have not yet replenished their ranks. Now, despite the recovery, many schools face unwieldy class sizes and a lack of specialists to help those students who struggle academically, are learning English as a second language or need extra emotional support.         \n\nDonna Guy\u2019s fourth-grade class at Caln Elementary School here is too big \u2014 30 pupils \u2014 for the room, so some of them sit halfway into a coat closet. Across town at Rainbow Elementary School, the 36 third graders in Kristen Pleasanton\u2019s gym class rotate on and off the bench during 25 minutes of seven-a-side soccer games, because she cannot supervise all of them playing at once.         \n\nAnd during social studies class at Scott Middle School, Keith Lilienfeld tries to keep control of a class of 25 students, 10 who need special education services, four who know little or no English and others who need more challenging work than he has time to give.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m up there putting out fires like you wouldn\u2019t believe,\u201d said Mr. Lilienfeld, who used to have the help of two or three classroom aides. \u201cThere\u2019s only one of me, and there\u2019s a need for about five of me in there.\u201d         \n\nAcross the country, public schools employ about 250,000 fewer people than before the recession, according to figures from the Labor Department. Enrollment in public schools, meanwhile, has increased by more than 800,000 students. To maintain prerecession staffing ratios, public school employment should have actually grown by about 132,000 jobs in the past four years, in addition to replacing those that were lost, said  \n, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington.         \n\nCoatesville, a diminished steel town with 7,200 students, used to employ more than 600 teachers, psychologists, reading and math specialists, and other certified personnel. Since 2008, the district has cut close to one-fifth of that staff, according to Angelo Romaniello, the district\u2019s assistant superintendent.         \n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t cut to the bone,\u201d said Audra Ritter, a middle school special education teacher and president of the Coatesville Area Teachers Association. \u201cWe cut into the bone.\u201d         \n\nSchool districts in other hard-hit states, including California, Maryland, Michigan, North Carolina and Texas, are coping with similarly squeezed resources. Along with budget cuts at the federal, state and local levels, rising public school enrollment over the past five years has exacerbated the pinch.         \n\nThe staffing gap has pushed elementary class sizes to 30 students and more in parts of California, where special state funds had been designated since the mid-1990s to keep classes in kindergarten through third grade capped at 20 students. In Dallas this year, the public school district has applied for more than 200 waivers from the state\u2019s maximum class size of 22 students for kindergarten through fourth grade.         \n\nClass sizes in some high schools in Charlotte-Mecklenburg County in North Carolina have swelled to as many as 40 students, and some guidance counselors are advising up to 500 students. In Cobb County, Ga., where the district has laid off about 1,300 staff members \u2014 or about 16 percent of the teaching force \u2014 in the past five years, average class sizes in fourth and fifth grades are now about 33 students, five above the state maximum of 28.         \n\nDistricts are making these difficult trade-offs at a time when schools are raising academic standards and business leaders are pushing schools to prepare a work force with better skills.         \n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t have the doublespeak where everybody talks about how important education is to our being globally competitive,\u201d said  \n, the executive director of the American Association of School Administrators, \u201cand then education is not a priority when it comes to funding.\u201d         \n\nIn Pennsylvania, although the state\u2019s education budget is now above prerecession levels, a large proportion of money is being diverted to replenish underfunded pensions, leaving less for actual classrooms, said  \n, research director at the Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center.         \n\nThe cutbacks have been particularly pronounced in less affluent school districts, which have trouble raising local property taxes or asking parents\u2019 associations to fill in gaps.         \n\nWealthier communities can lean more on parents and local taxpayers. Just 35 miles from Coatesville, in the  \n, which shares a border with the  \n, enrollment has swelled by about 15 percent to 7,900 students in the past five years. Property taxes have increased every year since 2008, and even elementary students now study foreign languages. The district has avoided cutting any staff members, leaving class sizes in the low to mid-20s.
