{"headline": "In Kansas, Museums, Fried Chicken and, Yes, \u2018Oz\u2019", "body": "\nKansas and New York City have more in common than I thought.         \n\nBoth are mostly laid out in planned grids of right angles rather than natural curves. Both have more numbered streets than named ones. Both get politically pigeonholed by outsiders, though on opposite ends of the spectrum. Both have a densely populated place called Manhattan (one admittedly more densely populated than  \n).         \n\nBut most of all, visitors to each arrive primed for what they might find from images implanted by pop culture. For New York, that can mean anything from \u201cSex in the City\u201d to \u201cDick Clark\u2019s New Year\u2019s Rockin\u2019 Eve.\u201d In Kansas, of course, it\u2019s a perennial classic: \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201d         \n\nJudging by the number of \u201cyou\u2019re not in Kansas anymore \u2014 wait, yes you are!\u201d messages I got from East Coast friends when they found out I was in the state, it\u2019s pretty clear that Dorothy, Toto and Auntie Em still top Bob Dole, Sam Brownback and Kathleen Sebelius as its standard-bearers.         \n\nI hoped to bring an open mind to my visit, which fell at about the halfway mark of  \n from Louisiana to North Dakota. The plan: explore some local museums, regional food and a natural preserve that could exist only in this part of the country. Yet even I fell under the poppy-scented spell of Oz.         \n\nWithin an hour of crossing into southeast Kansas from Oklahoma on a Saturday afternoon, I was in Franklin (population, 375) asking a woman named Phyllis Bitner what I might do that evening. \u201cThere\u2019s a community theater performance of \u2018The Wizard of Oz,\u2019 \u201d she said.         \n\nGiven that cultural immersion and frugality were two of my top missions on this trip, the idea was too good to pass up. So I headed to the  \n named for the 20,000-person Kansas city just over the Missouri state line. Members of the theater group told me they weren\u2019t doing \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d because it\u2019s a Kansas story but rather because it has plenty of roles for children, who were height-cast as Munchkins.         \n\nDespite tickets priced at a mere $5 and $10, the show was admirably elaborate, complete with a full pit orchestra, flying witches, an impressively flimsy scarecrow and, in the role of Toto, an unflappable dog named Bear. Local critics raved. \u201cThat was awesome,\u201d a kid named Dillon, who was sitting in front of me, enthusiastically shouted after the Munchkinland scene. \u201cCreepy!\u201d he cried after the witch shot fire out of the end of her broomstick at the scarecrow. After the show, he had his picture taken with the Cowardly Lion in the lobby; I hung out with cast and crew myself around the corner at a bar called  \n, where a \u201990s cover band called Bill and Monica\u2019s Excellent Adventure was playing.         \n\nHere\u2019s a sentence I didn\u2019t expect to write: There\u2019s more to rural southeast Kansas than night life. I had met Ms. Bitner in the Miners Hall Museum ( \n), a homespun but impressive (and free) year-old museum that documents the mining industry and culture that sustained the region for decades, with old carbide lamps, documents and photos. There is also space devoted to the so-called Amazon Army, a group of largely immigrant wives and daughters of striking miners who gained  \n after marching in support of a miners strike and preventing replacement workers from taking over. (The museum is in the process of recreating a coal camp in an area behind the building.)         \n\nThe region\u2019s other claim to semi-fame \u2014 its fried chicken \u2014 is tough to miss. Driving through, I spotted billboards for  \n and  \n, which faced off in a 2011 episode of the Travel Channel\u2019s \u201cFood Wars.\u201d Not interested in following the crowds, I had asked Ms. Bitner if there were other spots, and she sent me to Gebhardt Chicken Dinners \u2014 so unhyped it\u2019s not even marked  \n (though it does have  \n). For under $10, I had three pieces of chicken \u2014 juicy meat encased in a thin, crisp egg-and-cracker-based crust and fried to order \u2014 with sides and a drink. I also got a kick out of an address \u2014 124 North 260th Street, off East 620th Avenue \u2014 that almost sounds like it could be in Queens, but in fact is across from a cornfield.         \n\nWith local culture and tasty grub under my belt, I set out toward my remaining goal: the Flint Hills, where some of the last tallgrass prairie is preserved and bison have recently been reintroduced. But it turned out that local culture wasn\u2019t done with me yet. I decided to take the long route to the Hills and stopped off in Chanute at the Martin and Osa Johnson Safari Museum ( \n), one of the most enjoyable and thought-provoking museums I\u2019ve been to in a while.         \n\nMartin and Osa Johnson may not be well known today, but they were household names back in the 1920s. Naturalists and adventurers, they traveled the world, filming never-before-seen images from the South Pacific and Africa.         \n\nThough it also contains an impressive collection of African masks, headdresses and other artifacts, the museum mostly chronicles the lives of the Johnsons, both of whom were raised in Kansas. As a teenager, Martin aggressively sought a job as a cook on Jack London\u2019s voyage to the \u201cSouth Seas,\u201d and then kept on traveling. He was soon joined by Osa, with whom he eloped when she was 16. They would return to the South Pacific and film what even today is riveting footage of cannibalistic and headhunting cultures, including their capture by the Big Namba tribe of Malekula Island in the New Hebrides. They also made impressive nature films in Africa, a genre that still fascinates today but back then \u2014 without a telephoto lens \u2014 was perilous to pull off. (Osa, quite the sharpshooter, is shown in one film taking out a charging lion.) Leave plenty of time to watch the films, which are available by request on DVD.         \n\nFor me, perhaps the most fascinating aspect of all this is how offensive their language and attitude seem today. In one film showing Pacific Islander children having their heads bound, Mr. Johnson, narrating, says, \u201cIt didn\u2019t seem to affect their intelligence. As a matter of fact, they don\u2019t have any intelligence to start with.\u201d This was the thought-provoking part: it was a bit of a shock \u2014 but still fascinating \u2014 to hear such dated offensiveness stated in such a straightforward way.         \n\nAgain I set out to Flint Hills \u2014 and again I was sidetracked. I caught a sign along two-lane U.S. 75 that, proved irresistible to my curious urban brain: \u201cLivestock Auction, 6 p.m.\u201d Soon I had a front-row seat at the Coffey County Fair, watching 4-H members ages 7 to 18 march steer and heifers around a ring to the mesmerizing slur of an auctioneer\u2019s call. It was a spectacle, and I quickly became a sideshow as the good people of Coffey County explained what was going on: this was a premium auction, in which bidders were not buying the animals but essentially donating a cash prize to the young participants who had raised them.
