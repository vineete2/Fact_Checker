{"headline": "Altidore\u2019s Scoring Spree Energizes U.S. Team", "body": "\nSANDY, Utah \u2014 There was a moment in the second half Tuesday night when Jozy Altidore, the enigmatic striker for the United States national soccer team, watched a defender for Honduras send a pass back toward his goalkeeper. It was a steamy night at  \n and Altidore had been running for much of the game; he could have easily stayed put and watched the goalkeeper, Noel Valladares, take the ball and boot it downfield.         \n\nInstead, Altidore stirred, sprinting toward the end line. As Valladares received the ball, he saw the pressure from Altidore and had to quickly shift to the side, ultimately struggling to get a hurried blast away just as Altidore slid nearby.         \n\nAt the time, it was not a particularly memorable moment \u2014 certainly not compared with the winning goal Altidore scored in the 73rd minute, pushing the United States to  \n in a World Cup qualifier. But that sequence was important all the same, if only because it was emblematic of what Altidore has become for the United States lately: a relentless, energetic presence who delivers that which a striker is charged with providing. Over the past month for the United States Altidore has pushed and prodded, stalked and eventually scored.         \n\n\u201cI thought he was going to be a handful,\u201d Honduras midfielder Roger Espinoza said after the game. \u201cAnd he was.\u201d         \n\nIt has not always been that way. Altidore\u2019s goal Tuesday was his fourth in the past four games, making him only the sixth United States player to record such a scoring stretch; before this surge, however, he had not scored an international goal since 2011, a puzzling drought that brought continued criticism, particularly as Altidore began to score more regularly for his Dutch club team, AZ.         \n\nCoach Jurgen Klinsmann, a star striker for Germany in his playing career, used a combination of tough love and blunt reality checks with Altidore in an attempt to coax the best results from him. Most memorably, he dropped Altidore from the United States roster for two qualifying matches late last year, a decision that was questioned by many but, in retrospect, might have stirred Altidore from his slumber. He scored 31 goals for AZ last season and, Klinsmann said, showed up for training ahead of this month\u2019s international schedule with an obvious bounce.         \n\nFrom the first day of practice in Cleveland, Klinsmann said, it was clear that Altidore was energized. In this four-game stretch \u2014 covering three World Cup qualifiers and an exhibition win over Germany \u2014 he has demonstrated a greater ability both in front of the goal and in the run of play, using his body to hold off defenders and offer openings for teammates to pass him the ball.         \n\nIt must be said: the service he has received has been much improved, too, with midfielders like Michael Bradley and Graham Zusi consistently playing precise balls to him in critical areas. Fabian Johnson, who has played both on defense and in the midfield, has also repeatedly linked up with Altidore, providing pretty assists on his goals in the past two games.         \n\nAgainst Honduras, Johnson slipped to the end line and cut back a perfect pass that Altidore pounced on, using his left foot to angle the ball past Valladares.         \n\n\u201cJozy has just been a beast of late,\u201d Zusi said. \u201cWhen a guy is in as good form as he is, you just want to get the ball to him as much as possible. It definitely helps knowing that if you whip the ball in, he\u2019s at a point where he\u2019s going to finish it.\u201d         \n\nThe value of a top striker is immense for the United States, particularly as it slogs through  \n. Beyond that, though, Altidore\u2019s production is critical because it offers a complement to Clint Dempsey, who is known internationally as a scoring threat. With Altidore also running well, even the top teams the United States is likely to face in Brazil next summer will have to work to contain two offensive options.         \n\nAltidore has generally avoided interviews lately (though  \n he has encountered in the game), opting instead to focus on his performance. After Tuesday\u2019s game he answered a few questions from reporters and did his best to deflect the attention, praising his teammates and calling the past month the best stretch the United States has had in the past two years.         \n\nTo be sure, there have been plenty of other positives for the team: the defenders have recorded four shutouts in six qualifying games this year and the midfield has hardly missed Landon Donovan, especially as Zusi continues to become more consistent. Klinsmann, too, seems to be settling in and finding ways to get the most from his players regardless of what situation, or position, he puts them in. Even Altidore smiled when it was mentioned to him that it surely cannot hurt to be playing for a coach who used to be a feared scorer.         \n\n\u201cI think Jurgen \u2014 he knows a little bit about soccer,\u201d Altidore said, before adding, \u201cI still think there\u2019s a long way to go for me in terms of a learning curve.\u201d         \n\nFor a 23-year-old, that is surely the best approach, and Klinsmann has echoed the sentiment, noting that the difference in the speed of the game between the Dutch league and international matches is enormous.         \n\nThe question now is how Altidore will react to the vacation that he and the other Europe-based players began Wednesday. European leagues do not begin training until next month, and the next World Cup qualifier is not until September. At that point, the United States is likely to need one more win to clinch a place in Brazil.         \n\nAltidore, who could be playing for a more high-level team than AZ by then, will figure prominently in the United States\u2019 plans. After all, it is suddenly impossible to imagine him not making an impact.         \n\n\u201cWe knew he could do this,\u201d Dempsey said. \u201cThe goals came in Europe, so we knew eventually they would come here, too.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/sports/soccer/altidores-scoring-surge-energizes-us-soccer-team.html", "date": "2013-06-19", "description": "Jozy Altidore finally seems to be fulfilling his potential for the national soccer team, scoring four goals in the last four games after not scoring internationally since 2011."}
