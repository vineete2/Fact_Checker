{"headline": "Weak Job Gains May Cause Delay in Action by Fed", "body": "\nEven before the federal government shutdown and debt ceiling crisis this month, the nation\u2019s economy was lagging and job growth was sluggish. And the recent dysfunction in Congress seems likely to make the situation worse.         \n\nThe economy added just 148,000 jobs in September,  \n on Tuesday in a discouraging economic snapshot taken just before a federal shutdown that resulted in hundreds of thousands of furloughs. That shutdown, which delayed the release of the September employment report by more than two weeks, is expected to weigh on growth when the next monthly job market data is released on Nov. 8, a week behind schedule.         \n\n\u201cThe labor market lost, rather than gained, momentum over the summer, leaving us with less than a desirable cushion just as the government was shuttered in response to political shenanigans,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial.         \n\nThis year, in a pattern that has been followed for several years now, economists have been counting on job growth to pick up speed. That could finally start putting a more substantial share of the 11.3 million idle Americans back to work and make a greater dent in the unemployment rate, which ticked down to 7.2 percent last month.         \n\nBut yet again, those expectations are being dashed. Both experts at the Federal Reserve and  \n have scaled back their expectations for growth in output in recent months, with Fed officials and many economists blaming tighter fiscal policy for being a drag on the economy.         \n\nThe relatively weak September numbers, the subsequent fiscal showdown, the lack of available data and the economic distortions created by temporarily closing government offices are all expected to further delay the Fed\u2019s decision to begin scaling back on some of its efforts to stimulate the economy.         \n\nWhile the Federal Reserve has been trying to promote growth, the rest of Washington has largely been working in the opposite direction, analysts said, with Congress creating drags on the economy through resumption of a payroll tax that began in January, the across-the-board budget cuts known as sequestration that began in March, and then the partial government shutdown and debt ceiling crisis in October. The result has been to accelerate a longer-running trend of a shrinking federal work force; in September, the federal government had  \n.         \n\nA recent  \n from Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting firm, estimated that government reductions in discretionary spending as a share of the economy since 2010 had pushed the national unemployment rate higher by 0.8 percentage point than it otherwise would have been, the equivalent of 1.2 million absent jobs. Those same spending cuts have also shaved an estimated 0.7 percentage point off output growth each year. Those drags are separate from the costs of the shutdown, which are expected to reduce the annualized growth rate of gross domestic product in the fourth quarter by 0.2 to 0.6 percentage point, depending on which estimate is used.         \n\nAs a result, analysts predicted, the economy is expected to advance at roughly a 2 percent annualized pace for the fourth quarter and about 1.5 percent for the full year, or about 1 percentage point lower than might have been achieved without those fiscal hurdles to overcome.         \n\nThe pace of employment growth in September was slower than the average rate over the previous year, which was 185,000 jobs a month. The unemployment rate fell to 7.2, from 7.3 percent the previous month, a change that was not statistically significant. The unemployment rate has fallen by 0.4 percentage point since June, though much of the improvement was because many people have dropped out of the labor force and are no longer counted.         \n\nOther details of the report were lackluster. The length of the average workweek and the share of Americans actively engaged in the labor force both remained flat. Before August, the share of Americans in the labor force had not been this low since 1978, when women were less likely to be working. Economists have been expecting that this so-called labor force participation rate would pick up as workers waiting on the sidelines saw improvements in the job market and started applying for work again, but that has not yet happened.         \n\nThe biggest net hiring gains in September were in construction, wholesale trade, and transportation and warehousing.         \n\nMany economists said they expected the Fed to postpone into next year any move to scale back its major asset purchases, known as quantitative easing, because that action has been predicated on a steadily improving economy. \u201cIn light of the moderate tone of the September employment report, we have pushed out our expectation for the first Fed tapering in the pace of asset purchases to March 2014 from December 2013,\u201d economists at Barclays wrote in a note to clients.
