{"headline": "How Georgetown Became a Gay-Friendly Campus", "body": "\n\u201cCOME out of the closet in style!\u201d read the poster, and on a crisp fall day, dozens of students on Georgetown\u2019s Red Square did, metaphorically at least. They formed a winding conga line and sashayed through a life-size closet door. That afternoon, they gathered for same-sex smooching in a campus \u201ckiss-in.\u201d         \n\nThe day\u2019s events were part of \u201cOUTober,\u201d a month jam-packed with celebrations related to all things L.G.B.T.Q., or lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning. \u201cEvery month is a good month to be gay at Georgetown,\u201d said Thomas Lloyd, president of the campus pride group. Indeed, there\u2019s a Gender Liberation Week, Gay Pride Month, a popular drag ball called Genderfunk and a Lavender graduation ceremony attended by the university president.         \n\nNot so long ago, relations between the university and its gay students were strained. In 1980, the students  \n for equal privileges for their organizations. In 2007, they stormed the steps of Healy Hall, protesting what they saw as an inadequate response to antigay incidents. And a 2008 survey found that 61 percent of students thought homophobia was an issue. That year, the administration began to address the problem, opening an L.G.B.T.Q. resource center with a full-time staff.         \n\nFurther honing its current image as a gay-friendly campus, in March Nate Tisa became Georgetown\u2019s first openly gay student body president. Mr. Tisa, who clocked numerous hours at church retreats and religious summer camps as a boy in Rochester, N.Y., has called on the university to lead the church toward a new interpretation of homosexuality. \u201cSociety is changing,\u201d Mr.  \n  \n in The Hoya, Georgetown\u2019s student newspaper, \u201cand God is in that change \u2014 do not reject it.\u201d         \n\nAs the national gay rights movement touches down in state legislatures, the Supreme Court and even the Boy Scouts, it is also being felt at many of the nation\u2019s 267 Roman Catholic colleges and universities, where students and administrators are grappling with what it means to be young, gay and Catholic in 2013.         \n\nPerhaps nowhere has the movement been more visible than at the country\u2019s oldest Catholic university.         \n\n\u201cGeorgetown has made a huge commitment to its L.G.B.T.Q. community,\u201d said Shane Windmeyer, executive director of  \n, a national nonprofit group. \u201cIt has a history. It has a past. But today it is pushing the needle forward.\u201d         \n\nThe support for gay students has elicited nods of approval from many alumni, but it has agitated others. Some say that Georgetown is losing sight of its Catholic mission and has become a hotbed for viewpoints that conflict with church teachings. \u201c \n\u201d says to \u201crespect\u201d homosexuals \u2014 an attitude suggested by Pope Francis in his remarks this week regarding gay priests. But it denounces homosexual sex as \u201ccontrary to the natural law\u201d; homosexuality is thus, some argue, not part of God\u2019s plan.         \n\nShortly after Mr. Tisa\u2019s victory, William Peter Blatty, the octogenarian author of \u201cThe Exorcist,\u201d and Manuel A. Miranda, a fellow alumnus, circulated a  \n and 198-page memorandum condemning Georgetown for promoting a culture of \u201cmoral relativism\u201d and an ideology of \u201cradical autonomy.\u201d More than 2,000 alumni have signed the petition, which was sent in May to Cardinal Donald W. Wuerl, archbishop of Washington. The petition calls on the archbishop to better regulate the university or strip it of its Catholic identity, an unlikely but technically possible outcome.         \n\n\u201cThe petition\u2019s primary aim is very much akin to pressuring someone that you love very much into going into rehab,\u201d Mr. Blatty wrote me in an e-mail. He has deep roots at Georgetown. He attended on full scholarship, set his blockbuster horror story on campus and named his new watchdog group, the  \n, after the late Thomas M. King, a beloved theology professor.         \n\nOther groups, too, have made it their business to monitor Catholic colleges. The  \n was critical of Notre Dame for inviting President Obama, who supports abortion rights, to give a commencement address. The Cardinal Newman Society, founded in 1993 by a Fordham University alumnus, has attacked Boston College for turning a blind eye when students distribute condoms and DePaul University for allowing a production of \u201cThe Vagina Monologues.\u201d The Cardinal Newman Society has also taken aim at Georgetown for Genderfunk. This year, a male student went as a high-heeled Mary and danced to Madonna\u2019s \u201cLike a Virgin\u201d while Jesus (a woman) looked on.         \n\nSeveral pages of the Georgetown memorandum are dedicated to Mr. Tisa, his \u201cirrepressible and well-trained gay agenda\u201d and his attempts at \u201ccleverly redefining what Catholic means.\u201d         \n\nCardinal Wuerl declined to comment, but Rachel Pugh, a Georgetown spokeswoman, pointed to the university\u2019s two required theology classes and up to seven Sunday Masses at the main chapel as evidence that it is deeply connected to its Catholic identity. The university also organizes church retreats and regular Eucharistic adoration ceremonies. Dozens of priests live on campus and serve as spiritual mentors.         \n\n\u201cOur Catholic and Jesuit identity on campus has never been stronger,\u201d Ms. Pugh said. \u201cAcademically, we remain committed to the Catholic intellectual tradition.\u201d         \n\nMany students have an entirely secular experience at Georgetown. Sitting on a knoll overlooking the Potomac River, the university is a magnet for political junkies wanting access to the Capitol. But the obsession with politics is only part of the Georgetown story. Half of undergraduates identify as Catholic. The university\u2019s religious underpinnings are embedded in its philosophy, and so, too, is what some students refer to as \u201cthe God conversation,\u201d a dialogue about Jesuit values that regularly arises inside and outside of class.
