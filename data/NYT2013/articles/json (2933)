{"headline": "Google Searches for Style", "body": "\nPeople wearing  \n\u2019s glasses are transported to a strange new world in which the Internet is always in their line of sight. But for people looking at the people wearing those glasses, the view is even stranger \u2014 someone wearing a computer processor, a battery and a tiny screen on her face.         \n\nAs Google and other companies begin to build wearable technology like glasses and watches, an industry not known for its fashion sense is facing a new challenge \u2014 how to be stylish. Design has always been important to technology, with products like Apple\u2019s becoming fashion statements, but designing hardware that people will wear like jewelry is an entirely different task.         \n\nIn a sign of how acute the challenge is for Google, the company is negotiating  \n, an e-commerce start-up company that sells trendy eyeglasses, to help it design more fashionable frames, according to two people briefed on the negotiations who were not authorized to speak publicly because the partnership has not been made official. Google and Warby Parker declined to comment.         \n\nThey join other companies that are grappling with these design challenges, including big companies like Apple, Nike and Jawbone and smaller ones like Pebble, MetaWatch and Misfit Wearables.         \n\nJawbone\u2019s health-tracking wristband, Up, for instance, was designed by Yves Behar, the company\u2019s chief creative officer and a well-known designer who has worked with fashion and furniture companies. Apple, which is said to be making \n, has assigned some of its top designers to make curved glass that is comfortable and aesthetically appealing.         \n\nOn Wednesday, Google  \n to choose a small group of people to buy an early version of the glasses, called Google Glass. It hopes to sell Glass to the broader public this year, according to two people briefed on the plans.         \n\nThe frames do not have lenses, though Google is experimenting with adding sunglass or prescription lenses in some versions. They have a tiny screen that appears much bigger from the wearer\u2019s perspective than it does on the frame. Glass wearers can take pictures or record video without using their hands, send the images to friends or post them online, see walking directions, search the Web by voice command and view language translations.         \n\nThe glasses reach the Internet through Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, which connects to the wireless service on a user\u2019s cellphone. The glasses respond when a user speaks, touches the frame or moves the head.         \n\nFor Google, the glasses are a major step toward its dream of what is known as  \n \u2014 the idea that computers and the Internet will be accessible anywhere and we can ask them to do things without lifting a finger.         \n\nThe glasses will eventually incorporate several Google products, which could become more useful when they are in front of a user\u2019s eyes rather than on a phone or a computer screen.         \n\nFor instance, the latest version of the glasses can provide walking and hiking directions from Google Maps, alerts from Google Now about a coming meeting or a traffic jam, and video chats from Google Hangouts.         \n\nIn a \non Wednesday, Google offered ideas about what to do with the glasses. A ballerina could record and stream live video behind the scenes and onstage; a tourist in Thailand could ask Google to translate the word \u201cdelicious\u201d while eating noodles on a boat; or a family could video chat over a long distance with a relative on her birthday.         \n\nOther seemingly far-fetched uses are not far off. The glasses could be used to play an augmented reality game in which the real world was annotated with virtual information. Google has such a smartphone app, called Ingress. Users could photograph an object or building and the glasses could identify it, something that is already possible using Google on phones and computers.         \n\nThough Google warns of technical bumps as people use the glasses, it has already solved many of the technical challenges. The biggest obstacle now is getting people to use them.         \n\nThough Google employees have been spotted wearing them in the San Francisco Bay Area, they receive strange looks, for example, from a  \n of his Glass-wearing patrons.         \n\nPrivacy advocates worry about a day when people wearing glasses could use facial recognition to identify strangers on the street or surreptitiously record and broadcast conversations. On a more mundane level, rude behavior like checking e-mail during conversations would become much easier to hide.         \n\n\u201cChanging behavior is much more challenging than changing technology,\u201d said Olof Schybergson, founder and chief executive of Fjord, a design company that has helped clients build wearable devices.         \n\nThen there is that fashion hurdle. The frames now look like wire wraparound glasses with hardware along one side.
