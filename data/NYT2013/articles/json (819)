{"headline": "U.S. Letter Says Leaker Won\u2019t Face Death Penalty", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said in a letter sent to the Russian minister of justice this week that the United States would not seek the death penalty against Edward J. Snowden, and would issue him a passport immediately so he could travel back to the United States.         \n\nThe letter also offered reassurances that the United States would not torture Mr. Snowden, the former intelligence contractor who faces criminal charges of disclosing classified information and has been hiding in an airport in Moscow in order to evade the American authorities.         \n\n\u201cWe believe these assurances eliminate these asserted grounds for Mr. Snowden\u2019s claim that he should be treated as a refugee or granted asylum, temporary or otherwise,\u201d Mr. Holder said in the letter, which was sent to Justice Minister Aleksandr V. Konovalov.         \n\nA  \n was provided to The New York Times on Friday by a Justice Department official, in response to questions about communications between the United States and Russian governments about Mr. Snowden\u2019s fate.         \n\nThe charges Mr. Snowden faces in the United States do not carry the death penalty, the letter said, adding that the United States would not seek the death penalty \u201ceven if Mr. Snowden were charged with additional death penalty-eligible crimes.\u201d         \n\nMr. Holder said that Mr. Snowden\u2019s claims that he is unable to travel are false and that the United States was willing to issue him a special passport so he could return.         \n\n\u201cDespite the revocation of his passport on June 22, 2013, Mr. Snowden remains a U.S. citizen,\u201d Mr. Holder said. \u201cHe is eligible for a limited validity passport good for direct return to the United States. The United States is willing to immediately issue such a passport to Mr. Snowden.\u201d         \n\nThe Kremlin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, restated Russia\u2019s refusal to extradite Mr. Snowden, citing the lack of an extradition treaty between the two countries. \u201cWe have never surrendered anyone,\u201d he said in a statement reported by the Interfax news agency, \u201cand we will never do so in the future.\u201d         \n\nAt the same time, there have been indications here that the administration\u2019s warning that President Obama could cancel a planned meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin in September if Mr. Snowden remained in Russia might be complicating the issue. A decision on granting temporary status to Mr. Snowden while officials consider his request for temporary political asylum, which had been expected this week, now appears likely to be weeks away, according to officials.         \n\nMr. Peskov also said that Mr. Putin was resolved to avoid a deterioration in relations with the United States and that he remained in contact with \u201chis American counterparts.\u201d         \n\n\u201cYou can see by the president\u2019s schedule that he has not given it up for the sake of keeping an eye on Snowden,\u201d Mr. Peskov was quoted as saying.
