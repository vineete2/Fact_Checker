{"headline": "U.S. and Russia Plan Conference Aimed at Ending Syrian War", "body": "\nMOSCOW \u2014 Russia and the United States announced on Tuesday that they would seek to convene an international conference within weeks aimed at ending the civil war in Syria, jointly intensifying their diplomatic pressure on the combatants to peacefully settle a conflict that has taken more than 70,000 lives and left millions displaced and desperate.         \n\nSecretary of State John Kerry and his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov, announced their agreement to arrange the conference after a day of intense diplomatic meetings here. Mr. Kerry, who was visiting Russia seeking to find common ground on the Syria conflict, told reporters at a joint appearance with Mr. Lavrov in Moscow that the aim would be to push the government of President Bashar al-Assad and the Syrian opposition to attend.         \n\nThe announcement appeared to signal a strong desire by both countries to halt what has been a dangerous escalation in the conflict, with evidence of chemical weapons use, a surge in the number of civilians fleeing combat and a refugee crisis that is overwhelming Syria\u2019s neighbors. Israeli aerial attacks this past weekend on suspected munitions sites in Syria heightened and further complicated the tensions in the region.         \n\nMr. Kerry\u2019s visit also came as the Obama administration faced increasing calls to intervene in the conflict with lethal military aid to the insurgency or perhaps stronger action like the enforcement of a no-fly zone over Syria to protect rebel-held areas. The effort to seek a negotiated solution with the Russians suggested that the administration wanted to first make a public push toward diplomacy.         \n\nPresident Obama defended his cautious approach earlier in the day in Washington, telling reporters he was going to make decisions based on the facts and not \u201con a hope and a prayer.\u201d Mr. Obama, who has said the use of chemical weapons in Syria would cross a \u201cred line,\u201d reiterated his view that the evidence of such use was still insufficient to require action or enable him to unite American allies behind a response.         \n\nMr. Kerry said both Russia and the United States wanted to hold the peace conference \u201cas soon as practical, possibly, hopefully as soon as the end of this month.\u201d         \n\nThe United States supports the insurgency that has been seeking to depose Mr. Assad, while Russia has been his most important foreign patron. But as the two-year-old struggle in Syria has worsened, the Russian government has signaled that it is not necessarily bound to Mr. Assad\u2019s political survival as part of a solution.         \n\n\u201cI would like to emphasize we do not, we are not interested in the fate of certain persons,\u201d Mr. Lavrov told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cWe are interested in the fate of the total Syrian people.\u201d         \n\nIt was unclear how Mr. Kerry and Mr. Lavrov would persuade the antagonists to put aside their hostilities for talks, and there was no word on where they would be held \u2014 or even any assurance that they would take place.         \n\nBut the diplomatic effort was unusual, given the sometimes rancorous relationship between the United States and Russia, and seemed to be the one optimistic spot on what was otherwise another bleak day in the Syria conflict.         \n\n\u201cThe alternative is that there is even more violence,\u201d Mr. Kerry told reporters. \u201cThe alternative is that Syria heads closer to the abyss, if not over the abyss and into chaos.\u201d         \n\nBoth men spoke as Syria lost Internet access in what appeared to be a deliberate shutdown by the Syrian government, with networks there going offline at about 11 p.m. Syria time. Telephone access also appeared to be blocked. The government has intentionally disrupted the Internet in the past to foil rebel communications when the military was undertaking major operations.         \n\nInternet monitoring companies said traffic into Syria came to a dead stop, reflecting what they called an intentional effort to block any information from entering the country. \u201cIt\u2019s akin to someone removing all the street signs into Syria,\u201d said Matthew Prince, the founder of Cloudflare, a San Francisco-based Internet security firm that monitors large volumes of Internet traffic.
