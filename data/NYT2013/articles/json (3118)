{"headline": "A Rare Public View of Obama\u2019s Pivots on Policy in Syria Confrontation", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 When  \n strode into the Rose Garden last month after a week of increasing tension over Syria\u2019s use of chemical weapons, many assumed it was to announce that the attack that had been broadly hinted at by his own aides had begun. Instead, he turned the decision over to Congress. And when Mr. Obama appeared on television Tuesday night, a speech initially intended to promote force made the argument for diplomacy.         \n\nOver the last three weeks, the nation has witnessed a highly unusual series of pivots as a president changed course virtually in real time and on live television. Mr. Obama\u2019s handling of his confrontation with Syria over a chemical weapons attack on civilians has been the rare instance of a commander in chief seemingly thinking out loud and changing his mind on the fly.         \n\nTo aides and allies, Mr. Obama\u2019s willingness to hit the pause button twice on his decision to launch airstrikes to punish Syria for using chemical weapons on its own people reflects a refreshing open-mindedness and a reluctance to use force that they considered all too missing under his predecessor with the Texas swagger. In this view, Mr. Obama is a nimble leader more concerned with getting the answer right than with satisfying a political class all too eager to second-guess every move.         \n\n\u201cAll the critics would like this to be easily choreographed, a straight line and end the way they\u2019d all individually like it to end,\u201d said David Plouffe, the president\u2019s former senior adviser. \u201cThat\u2019s not the way the world works for sure, especially in a situation like this. I think it speaks to his strength, which is that he\u2019s willing to take in new information.\u201d         \n\nBut to Mr. Obama\u2019s detractors, including many in his own party, he has shown a certain fecklessness with his decisions first to outsource the decision to lawmakers in the face of bipartisan opposition and then to embrace a Russian diplomatic alternative that even his own advisers consider dubious. Instead of displaying decisive leadership, Mr. Obama, to these critics, has appeared reactive, defensive and profoundly challenged in standing up to a dangerous world.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no question he\u2019s very uncomfortable being commander in chief,\u201d Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, a Republican who worked with the White House to support force against  \n, said in an interview. \u201cIn personal meetings, he comes across very confident. I wish I could deliver a speech as well as he does. But it\u2019s like he wants to slip the noose. It\u2019s like watching a person who\u2019s caged, who\u2019s in a trap and trying to figure a way out.\u201d         \n\nFor good or ill, and there are plenty who argue both points of view, Mr. Obama represents a stark contrast in style to George W. Bush. The former president valued decisiveness and once he made a decision rarely revisited it. While he, too, changed course from time to time, Mr. Bush regularly told aides that a president should not reveal doubts because it would send a debilitating signal to his administration, troops in the field and the country at large.         \n\nMr. Obama came to office as the anti-Bush, his candidacy set in motion by his opposition to the Iraq war amid promises to be more open to contrary advice, more pragmatic in his policies and more contemplative in his decisions. When it came time to decide whether to send more troops to Afghanistan in 2009, he presided over three months of study and debate that even aides found excruciating at times but were presented as a more thoughtful process.         \n\nKnown as a disciplined candidate and personality, Mr. Obama earned praise for boldness with the daring Special Forces operation in Pakistan that killed Osama bin Laden, although that obscured the months of secret deliberations the public did not see. He likewise expanded drone strikes against people suspected of being terrorists and until recently expressed little doubt about their wisdom and necessity.         \n\n\u201cPresident Obama was elected in part because when Washington followed the conventional wisdom into Iraq, he took a different approach,\u201d said Dan Pfeiffer, his senior adviser. \u201cThe American people appreciate the fact that he takes a thoughtful approach to these most serious of decisions.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/12/world/middleeast/Obamas-Pivots-on-Syria-Confrontation.html", "date": "2013-09-11", "description": "President Obama\u2019s handling of his confrontation with Syria has been an unusual instance of a commander in chief seemingly thinking out loud and changing his mind on the fly."}
