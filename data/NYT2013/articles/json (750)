{"headline": "A Straight Man Asks How  to Ditch a Gay Friend When Traveling", "body": "\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n Let\u2019s start with Travel Etiquette 101: When traveling with friends, especially in midlife when we all have our idiosyncrasies, you\u2019re free to agree on any ground rules at all \u2013 as long as you set those rules \n your departure. And agreeing at the outset to take some separate excursions (you hate museums; he loves them) is perfectly acceptable. After all, going on a vacation together doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re joined at the hip.         \n\nBut let\u2019s move on to Advanced Travel Etiquette and the \u201cdilemma\u201d you posed. The principle here is simple honesty. So although you could simply say (as one poster suggested when I posed your question on my Facebook page), \u201cI have a friend in city X and I would like to spend time with her alone,\u201d that\u2019s not exactly true. Not to rain on your parade (or your vacation), but that little white lie is really a self-serving justification to get you out of this pickle. By omitting the salient fact that the friend you\u2019re going to visit is not \u201cgay-friendly\u201d and does not want your companion to participate, you have, at best, distorted the situation (some might say you\u2019ve done worse).         \n\nTo see what\u2019s worse, you need only ask yourself this: What if your traveling companion were African-American and your friend in a foreign land was not \u201copen-minded\u201d about blacks? Would you be willing to accept that? And would you \u201cdetour\u201d from your traveling pal? I rather doubt it.         \n\nIn fact, there still seems to be a double standard when it comes to discrimination based on race versus sexual orientation. We all know what happened to  \n last month when she admitted using the N-word: several of her business partners, like Target, Wal-Mart and the Food Network, dropped her like a sour-cream-laden hot potato. And rightfully so. But how did Capital One respond when its front man, the actor Alec Baldwin, tweeted what The Daily Mail in London called  \n? Nothing, really. The banking company  \nthat he should be fired.         \n\nMr. Baldwin, of course, is not alone in his use of antigay slurs. Earlier this month  \n in Santo Domingo reportedly used the word \u201cmaric\u00f3n\u201d (an antigay pejorative) to refer to the United States\u2019 nominee to be the next ambassador to the Dominican Republic. As  \n editor-in-chief of AMERICABlog, wrote: \u201cPaula Deen, a TV chef, lost her entire career for admitting insensitivity to minorities. But a Catholic cardinal does the same, and it\u2019s no big deal \u2014 just another day at the altar.\u201d         \n\nSo, here\u2019s my advice to you: When we allow others to think it\u2019s O.K. to voice antigay sentiment or discriminatory behavior, we help perpetuate those attitudes and we become accomplices at the same time.         \n\nI see this as a perfect opportunity to work to change her mind about L.G.B.T. people. I would e-mail ahead of time, giving her an easy way to change her mind: \u201c'George\u2019 and I would love to spend the day with you. He\u2019s one of my best friends and I think you\u2019d like him, too.\u201d At that point it\u2019s really up to her to step up (\u201cThat\u2019s great, I look forward to seeing you both\u201d) or out.         \n\nIf she says no to seeing you both, you might go as far as to say: \u201cIt\u2019s troubling to me that you\u2019re having difficulty accepting my friend who is gay. To be honest, I am disappointed in you because I had thought you were a thoughtful, big-hearted person.\u201d The point is to make it clear that you won\u2019t tolerate her kind of behavior and that you expect better from her.         \n\nIf she skips the chance to see you based on your traveling companion, she is not much of a friend at all. And if you take your \u201cdetour\u201d without being open with your gay friend, I would question what kind of friend you are to him. Or to make a wordplay on  \n part of our generation\u2019s coming of age, SILENCE = COMPLICITY.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/23/booming/a-straight-man-asks-how-to-ditch-a-gay-friend-when-traveling.html", "date": "2013-07-23", "description": "Wanting to visit a friend overseas who does not tolerate gays, a man wants to know how to tell his gay traveling companion he is not invited."}
