{"headline": "Devoted to Politics, MSNBC Slips on Breaking News", "body": "\nAt MSNBC they view it as rooting against death and destruction: the last thing the channel wants is more months like the last two, filled with terror bombings, tornadoes and plant accidents.         \n\nIt\u2019s not all altruism. The destruction MSNBC also wants to avoid is the havoc such news has been wreaking on its competitive standing.         \n\nIn May, MSNBC, which generally runs second to the dominant leader, Fox News, among cable news channels, plunged all the way to fourth place, dropping behind not only its closest rival, CNN, but also that network\u2019s sister channel, HLN (formerly Headline News).         \n\nAt a time of intensely high interest in news, MSNBC\u2019s ratings declined from the same period a year ago by about 20 percent. The explanation, in the network\u2019s own analysis, comes down to this: breaking news is not really what MSNBC does.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not the place for that,\u201d said Phil Griffin, the channel\u2019s president, in reference to covering breaking events as CNN does. \u201cOur brand is not that.\u201d         \n\nThe brand, one MSNBC has cultivated with success, is defined by its tagline, \u201cThe Place for Politics,\u201d and a skew toward left-wing, progressive political talk, the opposite of the conservative-based approach that has worked well for Fox News.         \n\nMSNBC began to commit itself to presenting a liberal spin on political coverage in the middle of the last decade, partly because it had not found success in previous models (like trying to be a news channel for younger viewers) and mostly because it had one host, Keith Olbermann, whose ratings were exploding based on his outspoken criticisms of the Bush administration and the conservative voices on Fox News.         \n\nMSNBC has ridden this formula to a consistent edge over CNN. It has topped that network about 80 percent of the time over the last three years, Mr. Griffin noted, by relying on a lineup of prime-time shows with strong hosts like Rachel Maddow. CNN has never made ideologically impassioned shows the basis of its appeal. Instead, it has thrived when its potent brand identity, the channel for breaking news, has come into play.         \n\nMr. Griffin acknowledged that CNN, which has experienced ratings gains near 100 percent in the last two months, shines in periods of intense news interest. But, he said, this will pass.         \n\n\u201cYou do have to look at the long term,\u201d Mr. Griffin said in May. \u201cIn the first quarter of this year, Fox News had its lowest quarter in a decade. A year ago CNN had its worst month ever. I tip my hat to what CNN has done this month, but let\u2019s not be so myopic as to think the whole world has changed.\u201d         \n\nFor the second quarter so far, MSNBC has averaged 704,000 viewers in prime time, down 18 percent from last year. Among viewers that news advertisers pay to reach, those 25 to 54, MSNBC has averaged 214,000 for the quarter, down 11 percent.         \n\nThe network has experienced steady growth in ratings over the last several years, however, and profits have followed. For example, a Pew Research study put the network\u2019s annual profit at $186.6 million for 2011, up from $168.8 million the prior year. The research firm SNL Kagan estimated MSNBC\u2019s 2012 profit at $202 million.         \n\nMr. Griffin pointed out that CNN has surged ahead of MSNBC (and occasionally even Fox News) when enormous news was breaking, like the tsunami in Japan in 2011 \u2014 but fell back once the news cooled. And on three nights last week, MSNBC edged back ahead of CNN in the prime-time hours, though CNN maintained a lead over the full day.         \n\nBut there is speculation that something different may be happening this time, that a combination of a more aggressive approach from CNN, dimming interest in political news in general, and a sense that MSNBC has less to offer in hard news coverage, may be eroding the advantage that the channel has enjoyed.         \n\nMr. Griffin acknowledged that with Jeff Zucker, the former NBC chief executive and an experienced news producer from the \u201cToday\u201d show, now leading CNN, the competition is going to increase.         \n\n\u201cWe have to be aware of it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure out how to deal with their aggression in our own way.\u201d         \n\nThe way will be consistent with the political brand \u2014 and that could be a risk.
