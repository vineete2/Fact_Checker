{"headline": "Inspired by Denise", "body": "\nIf the M.R.I. scan that the neurosurgeon was pointing to was, as it appeared to me, a map of South America, the tumor in the brain of my wife, Denise, was the size of Brazil. Enormous, imposing, bulging all its borders, not to be denied.         \n\nIt was early October. Denise had not been herself for months. A cheerful and enthusiastic woman, dedicated to her family, her friends, her work, she had become distant, lethargic. Often fatigued, her interests and activities had diminished. Her co-workers had called asking if she was all right, her sisters had taken note, her friends could not understand the changes in her. I thought that she was tired, possibly depressed. I thought that maybe she was in a rut, that patience and empathy was needed.         \n\nWhat was needed was surgery. After a fall at home from which she couldn\u2019t rise we went to the emergency room where the questions, the examinations and an M.R.I. turned up what was wrong: Denise had a meningioma growing in the membrane between her brain and her skull. It had probably been growing for years and was now seven centimeters, of a size and weight that was affecting her vision, her functions, her balance, her personality.         \n\nDenise was in the hospital for six weeks. She remained valiant and determined through three brain surgeries and intense physical and occupational therapy. She never faltered. She started therapy as soon as she could, from light bedside therapy, to participation from a wheelchair, through working with a walker, to walking with a cane. I observed one afternoon and was mightily impressed with Denise\u2019s determination to get up and down the training steps, to swing in and out of the car door simulation, to work at it until she was too tired to continue. She wanted to give her all, as she has done since I\u2019ve known her. Denise wanted to return to the people, the interests, the very life that she enjoyed and was missing.         \n\nOn the drives back and forth to the hospital, inspired by Denise, I found myself thinking quite a lot about the life that I had been missing, not just since her surgery but for the 35 years of our marriage. I am a survivor of severe sexual abuse that went on intermittently throughout my childhood. It happened, I know that it happened, and I have to live with it every day. When you grow up like that you are wary all the time; you rarely get close to anyone and you don\u2019t go around having feelings where people can see them. My method of coping was my manner: low visibility, in and gone; distance. Denise saw through me and signed on anyway, when we were both young. I had never considered that I could be loved by anyone. When I met Denise I was, to my great benefit, open enough to understand that she was a person with whom I could share myself. I committed to her and to a life together. There have been only a few occasions in my life when I\u2019ve looked and actually seen what was in front of me and fully felt the feelings I was feeling. One time was watching her walk down the aisle toward me, beaming, on our wedding day. I never looked away.         \n\nDenise has been my partner, my confidant, my sentry at the gate. She has been the lover who has never blown my cover. I walked through my father\u2019s wake with my arms crossed, always needing to be in another room. She shook hands and thanked people for coming. When our son was hospitalized with meningitis as a child she stayed overnight in his hospital room while I busied myself with errands at home and rehearsed how to visit him without seeming frightened. The therapy I endured trying to manage my memories nearly did me in, but Denise was there to listen if I needed to talk, or to sit by if I couldn\u2019t. The rage, the alcohol, the detachment; I knew that she would be there when I got through it. And she was there, during and after and since.         \n\nWhen she was able, Denise took a trip to Florida in February with her sister, who lost her home in Hurricane Sandy. It had been a goal to work toward, that these two sisters could sit together on a Florida balcony at sunset. And they did it. I went to pick them up at the airport when they returned and I saw Denise approaching from a distance, this little woman in a head scarf carefully negotiating her steps with her cane. When she looked up, saw me and smiled, I had that moment again that I knew what I knew and I felt what I felt: Here comes the love of my life, and I am so pleased and proud and lucky to be with her. I need to be visible, to participate, to feel and enjoy the rest of our time together, for as long as we\u2019ve got.
