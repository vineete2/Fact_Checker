{"headline": "E.A. Sports Settles Lawsuit With College Athletes", "body": "\nTwo of the three targets of a high-profile lawsuit seeking payment for student-athletes settled the closely watched case Thursday, leaving the N.C.A.A. as the lone remaining defendant.         \n\nThe terms of the settlement between the athletes and two of their targets, E.A. Sports and the Collegiate Licensing Company, were not disclosed in a federal court filing in Oakland, Calif.         \n\nThe lawsuit, which was filed by the former U.C.L.A. basketball player Ed O\u2019Bannon, could have broad implications for the future of college athletics, opening the possibility that student-athletes could share in the profits of big-time university sports.         \n\nThe case, which began more than four years ago, is focused on the rights of colleges athletes, how their likenesses are used \u2014 particularly in video games and broadcasts \u2014 and whether they should be paid.         \n\nThe settlement by the other parties, if approved by the judge, indicates that the N.C.A.A. will probably be alone in defending itself.         \n\n\u201cWe have asked for, but have not yet received, the terms\u201d of the settlement, said Donald Remy, the N.C.A.A.\u2019s chief legal officer, \u201cso we cannot comment further.\u201d         \n\nMichael Hausfeld, a lawyer for the athletes, declined to discuss the settlement terms but said it would not be an \u201cunreasonable inference\u201d to conclude that the student-athletes might now have the support of E.A. Sports and the Collegiate Licensing Company, which handles rights licensing for many universities.         \n\nHausfeld also said he did not believe the settlement \u201cchanges the mind-set of the N.C.A.A.\u201d         \n\nLegal analysts said the lawsuit had been particularly important to the N.C.A.A.         \n\n\u201cThe N.C.A.A. has a lot more at stake in terms of what this is going to be to their organization than E.A. Sports did going forward,\u201d said Justin Sievert, a lawyer with the Michael L. Buckner Law Firm, a sports law firm in Pompano Beach, Fla.         \n\nHe added, \u201cIf the N.C.A.A. settles or loses at trial, that will change the whole amateurism system.\u201d         \n\nE.A. Sports\u2019 interest in the case stems from its role as the maker of the college football video game series. The plaintiffs in the case had said that the characteristics of the players in the video games essentially mirrored those of actual college athletes, violating their rights.         \n\nOn Thursday, just before the settlement, which  \n, E.A. Sports  \n that it would not publish its college football video game in 2014 and that it was working to settle the case with the athletes.         \n\nThe decision not to make the college football video game in 2014 came after  \n over the summer and after calls for college athletes to be compensated had grown louder.         \n\nOn Saturday, a number of current college football players joined the push for N.C.A.A. reforms by putting the phrase \u201cAll Players United,\u201d or \u201cA.P.U.,\u201d on their equipment.         \n\n\u201cWe have been stuck in the middle of a dispute between the N.C.A.A. and student-athletes who seek compensation for playing college football,\u201d Cam Weber, E.A. Sports\u2019 general manager for American football, wrote on the company\u2019s Web site Thursday. \u201cJust like companies that broadcast college games and those that provide equipment and apparel, we follow rules that are set by the N.C.A.A. \u2014 but those rules are being challenged by some student-athletes.\u201d         \n\nThe announcement about the game signified a departure from E.A. Sports\u2019 earlier position: the company had said that it would move forward with a game next year, even after the N.C.A.A. said in mid-July that it was backing out.         \n\nIn August, three major conferences \u2014 the Southeastern, Big Ten and Pacific-12 Conferences \u2014 also moved away from the game. The lack of support, coupled with the pending lawsuit, left E.A. Sports \u201cin a difficult position,\u201d Weber said.
