{"headline": "Hitting the Wall: For Marathon Charities, Numbers Are Slowing", "body": "\nBy this time of year, the height of fall marathon season, the e-mails have long piled up: marathon aspirants seeking charitable donations from family and friends to help them secure a spot in a particular race. On race days, charity logos on runners\u2019 gear have become as ubiquitous as mile markers, an integral part of an event\u2019s feel-good message of fitness and philanthropy.         \n\nBut some race and nonprofit organizers are worried that after years of booming, the charity-running industry may be  \n like a runner at Mile 25.         \n\nConsider  \n a nonprofit focused on helping those with developmental disabilities that raised nearly $113,000 tied to the  \n last year with more than 30 runners registered. This year, despite the group\u2019s repeated outreach through Facebook and community recruitment events, only $16,000 has been raised and a mere five runners will wear bibs for the organization.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a tough year, to say the least,\u201d said Alyssa Franklin, YAI\u2019s manager of individual giving and donor communications. She added, \u201cI\u2019m worried we could actually lose money this year.\u201d         \n\nThe fund-raising juggernaut \nhas 432 runners in the New York City Marathon, compared with 542 last year. The Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation, the American Cancer Society and the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation are among several organizations that reported having fewer new charity runners this year than last. All told, of the 8,200 available charity spots for this year\u2019s marathon, about 3,000 remain open. Organizers said they expected the total raised to be $11 million to $14 million less than last year\u2019s.         \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s unprecedented is being at this point in time and everything is not sold out,\u201d said Mary Wittenberg, New York Road Runners\u2019 chief executive, weeks before the Nov. 3 race.         \n\nOrganizers in New York pushed back deadlines more than six weeks for charities. George A. Hirsch, the chairman of the board for Road Runners, the marathon organizer, said the fact that running-related fund-raising was also slumping outside New York was a concern.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard, I believe, to do that year after year,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re coming back to your same pool of friends. There\u2019s a lot of excitement the first time you say, Will you come and contribute to me for my charity? The second and third year, I think it gets harder to do that. It\u2019s a commitment, a real responsibility you take on to the charity.\u201d         \n\nThe Chicago Marathon this month filled its charitable spots, but some more quickly than others. The  \n, scheduled for April 21, rotates the charities involved in its programs to ensure that a fresh batch of fund-raisers regularly run the event, said Tom Grilk, the Boston Athletic Association\u2019s executive director.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s supply and demand,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re still under way, but clearly in light of last year\u2019s events, people want to run.\u201d         \n\nThe bombings at the finish line of the Boston Marathon this year and the cancellation of last year\u2019s New York City Marathon after  \n may be contributing to the lower charity participation rates this year. Runners who raised money connected to last year\u2019s New York City Marathon were guaranteed a spot this year, but were not necessarily required to raise money again.         \n\nSteven Yearwood of New York was among those who raised money last year for Memorial Sloan-Kettering\u2019s Fred\u2019s Team and had barely hit the halfway point of his $3,500 goal when the race was canceled. The extra year, he said, allowed him to try to gather more donations, but he is prepared to make up the difference with his own money.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m still asking people,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want people to know the story behind it and why you\u2019re running.\u201d         \n\nKaren Schwartzman, a breast and lung  \n survivor in Baltimore, said she planned to walk this year\u2019s marathon and raise $4,000 for a cancer-related charity. She sent social-media blasts to friends and hopes to use the proceeds from selling furniture to raise money, she said, but much of the $4,000 will come out of her pocket.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are so many charities, and they\u2019re good charities, but it\u2019s hard for people.\u201d         \n\nCharity running was largely pioneered by the London Marathon and gained popularity in the United States in the mid-1990s, expanding along with a boom in registrations for distance-running events. The New York City Marathon founder Fred Lebow loathed the practice of charity running, but a team bearing his name was started after his death in 1994.
