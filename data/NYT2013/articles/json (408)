It said banks had to step up risk controls and improve cash management. And they had to do it, the bank said, by avoiding a \u201cstampede\u201d mentality.         \n\nThe banks had quietly received  \n a week earlier, which set off, if not a rush for the exits, certainly widespread worry in China and financial centers around the world.         \n\nIt precipitated a cash squeeze among the banks that sent their short-term interest rates sharply higher last week. The crackdown, which appears aimed at reining in banks engaged in complex deals that involve hiding and repackaging risky loans so that regulators cannot notice them, also led to a sharp sell-off in stocks worldwide during the last week. Investors feared it might further slow the Chinese economy.         \n\nChina, the world\u2019s second-largest economy after the United States, has a huge influence on the world economy so the actions of its central bank are closely watched across the globe. But its financial and banking system remains opaque to Chinese and foreigners alike. Within the government\u2019s own warnings about lending lies its dilemma: it needs to control where money is being lent at the same time it wants to reform a banking system that has grown dependent on government direction.         \n\n\u201cThe government knows some banks are doing things that aren\u2019t prudent,\u201d says Yukon Huang, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. \u201cSome of them are taking easy money and putting it in Ponzi schemes. The government is saying, \u2018Don\u2019t do that any more. And don\u2019t count on the government to bail you out.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nLi Keqiang, China\u2019s prime minister, who took office last March, has promised a more market-oriented approach to managing the economy. And analysts say his economic advisers are pressing to reorganize the economy in a way that will allow it to respond better to market forces.         \n\nBut to put such reforms in place, the new government is going to have to take on powerful state-run companies and interest groups that sometimes resist pressure from the center or turn to allies in the central leadership who block such moves.         \n\nThe government\u2019s target is the sharp and potentially dangerous rise in the so-called shadow banking. Banks borrow at the low interbank rate, then lend to trust companies and smaller banks who in turn make riskier loans. The fear among some analysts is that the vast amount of bad debt and hidden liabilities the shadow banking system masks could start sinking banks. Those excesses could start a chain of other economic setbacks.         \n\nMost economists say China\u2019s financial system is not facing huge systemic risks, and that growth could even come in at 7 percent, which would still make it the world\u2019s fastest-growing major economy. But there are mounting concerns here that the good times could be over partly because the banking sector is hiding piles of bad debt.         \n\nThe Chinese government has the policy tools to deal with a crisis, including huge foreign exchange reserves and the ability to force state banks to lend in a time of crisis. The People\u2019s Bank of China is not an independent institution, like many central banks in major economies are; it reports to the central government.         \n\nBut after years of pumping money into the economy, the central bank can see signs of diminishing returns. Banks lent a huge amount of money in the first half of this year, and yet growth has been tepid. Manufacturing has begun to contract, according to a recent survey, and banks seem desperate for more cash.         \n\nLast Friday, Fitch Ratings said in a report that less money in the market for interbank loans could hamper some banks from making payouts when high-interest financial instruments for China\u2019s rich,called wealth management products, mature later this month.         \n\nFitch said about $244 billion would come due later this month and that the effort to make the payout could send short-term borrowing rates even higher.
