{"headline": "Herbal Supplements Are Often Not What They Seem", "body": "\nAmericans spend an estimated $5 billion a year on unproven  \n that promise everything from fighting off  \n to curbing hot flashes and boosting memory. But now there is a new reason for supplement buyers to beware: DNA tests show that many pills labeled as healing herbs are little more than powdered rice and weeds.         \n\nUsing a test called DNA barcoding, a kind of genetic fingerprinting that has also been used to help uncover labeling fraud in the commercial seafood industry, Canadian researchers tested 44 bottles of popular supplements sold by 12 companies. They found that many were not what they claimed to be, and that pills labeled as popular herbs were often diluted \u2014 or replaced entirely \u2014 by cheap fillers like soybean, wheat and rice.         \n\nConsumer advocates and scientists say the research provides more evidence that the herbal supplement industry is riddled with questionable practices. Industry representatives argue that any problems are not widespread.         \n\nFor the study, the researchers selected popular medicinal herbs, and then randomly bought different brands of those products from stores and outlets in Canada and the United States. To avoid singling out any company, they did not disclose any product names.         \n\nAmong their findings were bottles of echinacea supplements, used by millions of Americans to prevent and treat colds, that contained ground up bitter weed, Parthenium hysterophorus, an invasive plant found in India and Australia that has been linked to  \n, nausea and  \n.         \n\nTwo bottles labeled as St. John\u2019s wort, which  \n, contained none of the medicinal herb. Instead, the pills in one bottle were made of nothing but rice, and another bottle contained only Alexandrian senna, an Egyptian yellow shrub that is a powerful laxative. Gingko biloba supplements, promoted as memory enhancers, were mixed with fillers and black walnut, a potentially deadly hazard for people with nut  \n.         \n\nOf 44 herbal supplements tested, one-third showed outright substitution, meaning there was no trace of the plant advertised on the bottle \u2014 only another plant in its place.         \n\nMany were adulterated with ingredients not listed on the label, like rice, soybean and wheat, which are used as fillers.         \n\nIn some cases, these fillers were the only plant detected in the bottle \u2014 a health concern for people with allergies or those seeking gluten-free products, said the study\u2019s lead author,  \n, a biology professor and botanical director of the  \n at the University of Guelph.         \n\nThe  \n, follow a number of smaller studies conducted in recent years that have suggested a sizable percentage of herbal products are not what they purport to be. But because the latest findings are backed by DNA testing, they offer perhaps the most credible evidence to date of adulteration, contamination and mislabeling in the medicinal supplement industry, a rapidly growing area of  \n that includes an estimated 29,000 herbal products and substances sold throughout North America.         \n\n\u201cThis suggests that the problems are widespread and that quality control for many companies, whether through ignorance, incompetence or dishonesty, is unacceptable,\u201d said David Schardt, a senior nutritionist at the  \n, an advocacy group. \u201cGiven these results, it\u2019s hard to recommend any herbal supplements to consumers.\u201d         \n\nRepresentatives of the supplement industry said that while mislabeling of supplements was a legitimate concern, they did not believe it reached the extent suggested by the new research.         \n\nStefan Gafner, the chief science officer at the  \n, a nonprofit group that promotes the use of herbal supplements, said the study was flawed, in part because the bar-coding technology it used could not always identify herbs that have been purified and highly processed.         \n\n\u201cOver all, I would agree that quality control is an issue in the herbal industry,\u201d Dr. Gafner said. \u201cBut I think that what\u2019s represented here is overblown. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as bad as it looks according to this study.\u201d         \n\nThe  \n has used bar-coding technology to warn and in some cases prosecute sellers of seafood found to be \u201cmisbranded.\u201d The DNA technique has also been used in  \n, which showed that a significant percentage contain herbs and ingredients that are not listed on their labels.         \n\nBut policing the supplement industry is a special challenge. The F.D.A. requires that companies test the products they sell to make sure that they are safe. But the system essentially operates on the honor code. Unlike prescription drugs, supplements are generally considered safe until proved otherwise.         \n\nUnder a 1994 law, they can be sold and marketed with little regulatory oversight, and they are pulled from shelves generally only after complaints of serious injury. The F.D.A. audits a small number of companies, but even industry representatives say more oversight is needed.         \n\n\u201cThe regulations are very appropriate and rigorous,\u201d said Duffy MacKay of the  \n, a supplement industry trade group. \u201cBut we need a strong regulator enforcing the full force of the law. F.D.A. resources are limited, and therefore enforcement has not historically been as rigorous as it could be.\u201d         \n\nShelly Burgess, a spokeswoman for the F.D.A., said that companies were required to adhere to a set of good manufacturing practices designed to prevent adulteration, but that many were ignoring the rules.         \n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we are seeing a very high percentage \u2014 approximately 70 percent \u2014 of firms\u2019 noncompliance,\u201d she said, \u201cand we are very active in taking enforcement actions against such violations.\u201d         \n\nDNA bar coding was developed about a decade ago at the University of Guelph. Instead of sequencing entire genomes, scientists realized that they could examine genes from a standardized region of every genome to identify species of plants and animals. These short sequences can be quickly analyzed \u2014 much like the bar codes on the items at a supermarket \u2014 and compared with others in an electronic database. An electronic reference library at Guelph, called the International Barcode of Life Project, contains over 2.6 million bar code records for almost 200,000 species of plants and animals.         \n\nThe testing technique is not foolproof. It can identify the substances in a supplement, but it cannot determine their potency. And because the technology relies on the detection of DNA, it may not be able to identify concentrated chemical extracts that do not contain genetic material, or products in which the material has been destroyed by heat and processing.         \n\nBut Dr. Newmaster emphasized that only powders and pills were used in the new research, not extracts. In addition, the DNA testing nearly always detected some plant material in the samples \u2014 just not always the plant or herb named on the label.         \n\nSome of the adulteration problems may be inadvertent. Cross-contamination can occur in fields where different plants are grown side by side and picked at the same time, or in factories where the herbs are packaged. Dr. Gafner of the American Botanical Council said that rice, starch and other compounds were sometimes added during processing to keep powdered herbs from clumping, just as kernels of rice are added to salt shakers.         \n\nBut that does not explain many of the DNA results. For instance, the study found that one product advertised as black cohosh \u2014 a North American plant and popular remedy for hot flashes and other  \n symptoms \u2014 actually contained a related Asian plant, Actaea asiatica, that can be toxic to humans.         \n\nThose findings mirror a  \n conducted at Stony Brook University medical center last year. Dr. David A. Baker, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive medicine, bought 36 black cohosh supplements from online and chain stores. Bar coding tests showed that a quarter of them were not black cohosh, but instead contained an ornamental plant from China.         \n\nDr. Baker called the state of supplement regulation \u201cthe Wild West,\u201d and said most consumers had no idea how few safeguards were in place. \u201cIf you had a child who was sick and three out of 10 penicillin pills were fake, everybody would be up in arms,\u201d Dr. Baker said. \u201cBut it\u2019s O.K. to buy a supplement where three out of 10 pills are fake. I don\u2019t understand it. Why does this industry get away with that?\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/science/herbal-supplements-are-often-not-what-they-seem.html", "date": "2013-11-03", "description": "A study using DNA testing offers perhaps the most credible evidence to date of adulteration, contamination and mislabeling in the herbal supplement industry."}
