{"headline": "Facebook Grabs for Your Phone. What Gives?", "body": "\n \n, man. Unbelievable. Second-most-visited Web site in the world. Frequented monthly by one-sixth of the earth\u2019s population. Primary source of news for half of America\u2019s young people.         \n\nSo vast and powerful is Facebook that it didn\u2019t seem implausible when the rumors began: Facebook was about to introduce its own cellphone. Look on our works, Apple and Google, and despair!         \n\nThe rumors were wrong. The new \u201cFacebook phone\u201d isn\u2019t a phone. Instead, it\u2019s a set of apps for phones running the Android operating system. Starting Friday, you can download them from the Google app store onto certain phones from HTC (One and One X) and Samsung (Galaxy S III, S 4 and Note II). More Android models will be compatible in the coming months, Facebook says. These apps also come preinstalled on the new HTC First, which costs $100 with a two-year AT&T contract.         \n\nThis software suite, called Home, replaces the standard Home screen and Lock screen of the phone.         \n\nIn their places, what you see is a slowly scrolling parade of full-screen photos from your Facebook news feed. Text-only posts appear, too, using your friend\u2019s primary profile picture (cover photo) as the photographic background.         \n\nThe company says that at the moment, the Cover Feed \u2014 this parade of images on your Lock screen and Home screen \u2014 represents only about 80 percent of what you would see on the actual Facebook Web site.         \n\nWhat\u2019s missing? Video posts and ads. Both, Facebook says, are coming soon. Yes, you read that right: the latest billboard for advertising is your own cellphone\u2019s home screen. Are you ready for this?         \n\nYou can have all kinds of fun on the Cover Feed. If the stately scrolling is too slow for your tastes, you can flick to the next photo, and the next, and the next.         \n\nYou can double-tap the screen to \u201clike\u201d a post. You can hold a finger down on the screen to see the entire photo, smaller; big parts of it are generally chopped off in the process of enlarging it to fill the phone\u2019s screen. And you can tap a tiny speech-balloon icon to read people\u2019s comments, or to leave one of your own.         \n\nFacebook correctly points out that this sort of newsfeed screen saver is an excellent time killer when you\u2019re standing in line or waiting for someone. At the same time, the Home software replaces the Home and Lock screens that Google or your phone maker designed. Unfortunately, you lose some good features in the process.         \n\nFor example, for most people, the entire purpose of a Home screen is displaying app icons. But there are no icons on Facebook\u2019s Home screens; Facebook thinks you\u2019d rather use that space for reading Facebook updates.         \n\nThe only icon that appears is your own profile photo. You can drag it to the left to open the Facebook Messaging app, to the right to open the last open app \u2014 or upward to open a grid of app icons on a gray background. Ah, here are the apps. But it\u2019s awfully sparse; where are the rest?         \n\nThey\u2019re on a screen off to the left. Swipe your finger to see, on a black background, the usual Android \u201call apps\u201d screen. From here, you can hold your finger down on a particular app\u2019s icon to install it onto the gray-background launcher screen, which can have multiple pages.         \n\nIf it sounds confusing, that\u2019s because it is. In removing the app-launching function from the Home screen, Facebook has wound up having to reinvent the way you open programs on your phone, and the result feels like a hack. The black-background screen to the left lists all of your apps, and scrolls vertically; the nearly identical gray-background screen lists only your favorites, and scrolls horizontally. Got it?         \n\nLet\u2019s hope you don\u2019t use Android widgets much, either \u2014 those small windows on your Home screen that display news headlines and new e-mail messages. Facebook Home relegates them to Android\u2019s traditional Home screens. They\u2019re still accessible, though buried. (They appear when you tap the More button on the black-background app screen.)
