{"headline": "Seeing History Through Dad\u2019s Eyes, I Found a Window to His Childhood", "body": "\nI graduated from college this spring and moved in with my parents for the summer.         \n\nMy father\u2019s first question once I arrived home: \u201cHey, Em, have you seen \u2018In Harm\u2019s Way\u2019 \n\u201d         \n\n\u201cNot yet.\u201d He has asked me this before. \u201cBut, Dad, we should watch it sometime soon.\u201d         \n\n\u201cYou know, we should also watch \u2014\u201d         \n\n\u201c \u2018Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison.\u2019 \u201d         \n\n\u201cMmhmm.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll add it to the list.\u201d         \n\nFor a long time, the list was a mental catalog of movies, books and British mini series on or relating to World War II. This summer, since I\u2019m spending more time at home than I have in years, I have added a collection of Post-it notes stuck to my desk.         \n\nMy father and I have made some progress on the list. I\u2019ve seen \u201cBand of Brothers,\u201d and I\u2019ve read William Manchester\u2019s biography, \u201cThe Last Lion.\u201d I\u2019ve been to the Imperial War Museum, to the Churchill War Rooms and to Blenheim. I\u2019ve learned about the blitz, the sacrifices made for St. Paul\u2019s.         \n\nI\u2019ve done all of these things with him.         \n\nAs my brother and I were growing up, Dad told us, again and again, his many personal aphorisms.         \n\n\u201cLet the saw do the work.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier to stay warm than to get warm.\u201d         \n\n\u201cAlways fill up the car before a long drive.\u201d         \n\nI\u2019ve kept them all in a special part of my mind, and even find myself repeating them to friends now and again. And yet, amid the lessons, one of the most affecting has always been his emphasis on the remarkable events of World War II.         \n\nMy father was born on June 16, 1949, 3 years, 9 months and 14 days after the Japanese surrender on Sept. 2, 1945. In 1947, at 17, his father enlisted in the Navy, and my dad grew up on Navy bases during the 1950s and \u201860s, including Pearl Harbor from 1958 to 1961. The effects of the Pacific War were right there, all around him. Everyone he knew and admired had deep connections to the war, including both grandfathers and two uncles who had served in the Army and the Air Force, respectively. World War II\u2019s aftermath was a large part of Dad\u2019s childhood and adolescent world.         \n\nIts rumination was mine. I learned from and with my father (through speeches, books, movies, TV shows, paintings, museums) about the grit of the British people in the face of 57 consecutive nights of bombings from the Luftwaffe, the sacrifices of American sailors at Midway and Iwo Jima, the G.I. Bill\u2019s prioritization of education, and the giants of the time, Roosevelt, Churchill and Truman. It was something we shared, but I fell in love in my own right, too. Stories of endurance and collective sacrifice stuck with me: communities of ordinary people pulling together, a kind of solidarity I found deeply appealing.         \n\nAt the same time, I learned about the hard times of my father\u2019s upbringing. Navy enlisted men made very little then, and Dad\u2019s family did not qualify for base housing, living in trailer parks until he was in the fourth grade. They moved often from base to base, so he attended five elementary schools and three junior highs. He was the first in his family to go to college and paid his way by working part-time jobs. I would learn about these things in bits and pieces, and sometimes it would make me upset. Not because I was sorry for him, but because my childhood was so different from his, and I was grateful for that.         \n\nI grew to recognize, and then to appreciate, his subtle but persistent encouragement of my inquiries. Dad would tape notes to the headboard of my bed, with captivating but confusing lines from books. One time, all I got was:         \n\n\u201cOne Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.\u201d         \n\nI would race into his room and ask to go to the bookstore. He would always say yes. We frequented a Barnes & Noble store, with cavernous ceilings and a lingering smell of leather and detergent. The bookstore was the one place I could choose anything (including \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d volumes) and I could stay for as long as I wanted. Then we would sit together, in two huge yellow armchairs in our living room, and read aloud. He would do one chapter, then I would do one chapter, until I fell asleep.         \n\nThat is how I learned of my father\u2019s fascination with the people who fought and won World War II and his deep love of history. When I was in the eighth grade, my parents decided to send me to private school. It was an enormous sacrifice, but something that I didn\u2019t realize at the time. We are a middle-class family; my mom works as a human resources executive and my dad as an educational editor. Private school for my brother and me took a large portion of their income. Dad drove me to school twice a week when I asked to leave before the bus did; it was a one-hour commute each way. During the drive, I would pepper him with questions: What would have happened in the postwar period if Roosevelt hadn\u2019t died? Why did Churchill\u2019s party lose the election in 1945? Was Truman right to bomb Hiroshima? His answers were some of my first tastes of intellectual complexity.         \n\nOn June 16, 2013, my dad turned 64. My mom, my brother and I picked out a restaurant, and I rented \u201cIn Harm\u2019s Way.\u201d But we are already planning the present we hope to give him next year when he turns 65: a family trip to Normandy, to see the beaches.
