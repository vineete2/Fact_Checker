{"headline": "Nadal Beats Djokovic to Win U.S. Open", "body": "\nIt was early afternoon on Monday at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center and  \n\u2019s father, Sebastian, and other members of the Nadal clan were wandering through the United States Open Court of Champions snapping photographs of the plaques honoring inductees past.         \n\nThere was a time, not so long ago, when Nadal looked like a long shot for a place on that wall. He was a clay-court champion first and foremost, then a grass-court champion.         \n\nBut he is among the greats on all the Grand Slam surfaces now and on Monday he put an exclamation point on the most astonishing hardcourt season of his career by beating his new archrival,  \n, 6-2, 3-6, 6-4, 6-1, to win the  \n championship.         \n\n\u201cFor a few things, this season is probably the most emotional one in my career,\u201d said Nadal, a 27-year-old from the Spanish island of Majorca. \u201cI felt I did everything right to have my chance here. You play one match against one of the best players in the history in Novak and No. 1 in the world on probably his favorite surface. I knew I had to be almost perfect to win.\u201d         \n\nWatching him with no tape on his left leg and no ball seemingly too far out of reach, it was frankly difficult to believe that he had seriously considered skipping hardcourt tournaments altogether earlier this season to protect himself from a recurrence of the knee problems that had kept him off the tour for seven months.         \n\nBut Nadal, perhaps the most relentless competitor in the sport\u2019s long and talent-rich history, is nothing if not resilient; nothing if not competitive. He plays, by his own confession, not just to win titles but for the puritanical pleasure of working for each and every point.         \n\n\u201cI am a positive player, not a negative player,\u201d Nadal said.         \n\nIt is the process more than the destination for Nadal, but he still looked more than satisfied when he had finally finished off Djokovic on a night with a sliver of moon visible in the sky and more than a few tears visible in his eyes and the eyes of those closest to him.         \n\n\u201cGrande, grande, grande, grande, grande,\u201d came the shouts from his camp after he had picked himself up off the court and eventually jogged to the edge of the court to commune with them.         \n\nThis victory, more grueling than the score line would suggest, gave Nadal a second United States Open title to go with the first he won in 2010 with another four-set victory over Djokovic. It also gave him a 13th Grand Slam singles title that seemed anything but unlucky.         \n\n\u201cThirteen is an amazing number,\u201d Nadal said.         \n\nBut perhaps the most remarkable statistic after a victory that generated a mother lode was that it preserved Nadal\u2019s perfect record on hardcourts this season.         \n\nHe is 22-0, a figure that would have seemed unthinkable in the years when Nadal\u2019s most emblematic rival, Roger Federer, was winning five straight titles at the Open.         \n\nFor now, Federer remains the career leader with 17 Grand Slam singles titles, but Monday\u2019s victory thrusts Nadal ever more into the conversation about who deserves to be called the greatest player of this era.         \n\n\u201cLet me enjoy today,\u201d Nadal said with a grin, resisting the place-in-history questions. \u201cFor me is much more than what I ever thought, what I ever dreamed. I said that when I had a few Slams less, but is true.\u201d         \n\nNadal has won eight French Opens, two Wimbledons, two United States Opens and one Australian Open. He also holds a winning record over every one of his major rivals, Federer of course included.         \n\nDjokovic, a 26-year-old Serb, has given him plenty of trouble: never more than in 2011 and early 2012 when he reeled off seven straight victories against the Spaniard and seemed to have extinguished some of Nadal\u2019s self-belief and competitive fire.         \n\nBut Nadal, a great tennis  \nas well as athlete and fighter, has now won six of the last seven. By the epic standards of their nearly six-hour final at the 2012 Australian Open, Monday\u2019s match was a sprint at 3 hours 21 minutes. It also gave Nadal a huge payday: $2.6 million in prize money and an additional $1 million for winning the U.S. Open Series.         \n\n\u201cThirteen Grand Slams for a guy who is 27 years old is incredible,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cWhatever he achieved so far in his career is something that everybody should respect, no question about it. I was saying before, he\u2019s definitely one of the best tennis players ever to play the game.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/sports/tennis/nadal-beats-djokovic-to-win-us-open.html", "date": "2013-09-09", "description": "No. 2 Rafael Nadal beat No. 1 Novak Djokovic, 6-2, 3-6, 6-4, 6-1, for his second United States Open singles title.
