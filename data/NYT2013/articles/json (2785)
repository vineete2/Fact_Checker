When that failed to repel the odors, members of Parliament simply abandoned the place.         \n\nThe leader of the House and chancellor of the Exchequer, Benjamin Disraeli, \u201cwas seen fleeing from the chamber, his handkerchief to his nose,\u201d according to Stephen Halliday in his history, \u201cThe Great Stink of London.\u201d         \n\nAt the time, nearly all of London\u2019s sewage ended up in the Thames, which was also one of the city\u2019s main sources for drinking water, and the city endured three cholera epidemics, which killed more than 31,000 people. The Thames stank famously, and many doctors and politicians believed that it was the stench itself that caused cholera.         \n\nPressure grew to follow the recommendation of a prominent civil engineer, Joseph W. Bazalgette, to build a system of tunnels that would catch the sewage and divert it farther downstream, below the capital, and construction soon got under way. The tunnels of the 1,100-mile system \u2014 lined with 314 million bricks meticulously laid by Victorian masons \u2014 remain in surprisingly good condition today.         \n\nBuilt for a city half London\u2019s current size, however, the system is now overflowing. As often as once a week, raw sewage is forced into the Thames, a sharp change from the 19th century, when the newly built system overflowed less than once a year.         \n\nThe increasing flow of raw sewage \u2014 the result of the loss of green spaces to absorb rainwater as much as population gain \u2014 violates European environmental law, the European Commission said in 2009, and the government has promised to act.         \n\nBut in an era of austerity and strained budgets, it is not the government that is paying the $6.6 billion bill but  \n, a private company with shareholders. The government is to underwrite the risk, which means that it will act as the financier of last resort in the case of major problems during the construction, but it will otherwise not pay for the new system.         \n\nThere is a catch, of course: it is actually the customers of Thames Water who are paying for the project with higher water bills, a prospect almost as horrendous to today\u2019s Londoners as the river\u2019s stench was to their 19th-century forebears. Water bills for Thames Water\u2019s 14 million customers in and around London are to rise to as much as $700 annually from $570 for the foreseeable future, the company said. The money will be used to repay the initial investors, who will also own the new system. And even then, the tunnel will remain the property of the company, a prospect that further rankles.         \n\nA variety of local politicians and industry experts say the plan is akin to pouring money down the drain, that construction estimates are far too low, and that there are cheaper and less disruptive alternatives. \u201cThe costs might end up at 10 billion pounds,\u201d or about $16.16 billion, said Nicholas Botterill, council leader of Hammersmith and Fulham, districts in southwest London, \u201cand I don\u2019t want the country to waste that much money.\u201d         \n\nIt would also be unpleasant for people living close to the construction sites, he said. Even the engineer who initially planned the new sewage tunnel, Chris Binnie, is now saying two smaller and far less costly tunnels might suffice.         \n\nMr. Bazalgette\u2019s system cost about $6 million, now the equivalent of about $6 billion, according to Thames Water, but it transformed central London. For example, he narrowed the Thames by building Victoria Embankment, an elegant road and walkway that housed not only the sewerage tunnel but also one of the first subways.         \n\nThe scope of today\u2019s planned project is no less intimidating. The new tunnel would run mainly beneath the Thames to intercept sewage before it reached the river and to transport it to sewage treatment plants. The tunnel would be more than 15 miles long, more than 200 feet deep and large enough to fit three London double-decker buses next to one another.
