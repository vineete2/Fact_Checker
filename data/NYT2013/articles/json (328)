{"headline": "Pope Is Quoted Referring to a Vatican \u2018Gay Lobby\u2019", "body": "\nROME \u2014 For years, perhaps even centuries, it has been an open secret in Rome: That some prelates in the Vatican hierarchy are gay. But the whispers were amplified this week when Pope Francis himself, in a private audience, appears to have acknowledged what he called a \u201cgay lobby\u201d operating inside the Vatican, vying for power and influence.         \n\nThe remarks \u2014 which the Vatican spokesman did not deny and the participants at the private audience confirmed \u2014 appeared to be part of an effort by the pope to take on the entrenched interests in the Vatican that many believe were a factor in why the previous pope, Benedict XVI, resigned unexpectedly. They appear to underscore numerous reports in the prelude to the election of the pope, that corruption, blackmail and violation of one of the highest codes of Catholic conduct were part of the intrigue that scandalized the Vatican in recent years.         \n\nFrancis, who portrays himself as a simple pope of the people, has made it clear that one of his highest priorities is to put the Vatican\u2019s house in order. He has appointed a group of eight cardinals to advise him on how to overhaul the Vatican, and the head of the Vatican Bank has recently given a series of interviews to journalists \u2014 an openness unheard of under his predecessors.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty incredible that the pope said these things,\u201d said Sandro Magister, a Vatican expert at the Italian weekly L\u2019Espresso. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt on the foundation of the phrases attributed to him. Otherwise they would have denied it.\u201d         \n\nThe pope made the remarks at the Vatican on June 6, while speaking to a meeting of the Latin American and Caribbean Confederation of Religious, the regional organization for priests and nuns of religious orders.         \n\n\u201cIn the Curia, there are also holy people, really, there are holy people. But there also is a stream of corruption, there is that as well, it is true,\u201d he said in Spanish,  \n of the meeting posted on a Chilean Web site, Reflection and Liberation, and later translated into English by the blog  \n.         \n\n\u201cThe \u2018gay lobby\u2019 is mentioned, and it is true, it is there ... We need to see what we can do,\u201d Francis continued, in the document, produced here verbatim.         \n\nOn Tuesday, the Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, did not deny the reports of Francis\u2019s remarks, saying only that he had no comment on a private meeting \u2014 a marked shift from past months, in which the Vatican  \n \u201cunverified, unverifiable or completely false.\u201d         \n\nAlso on Tuesday, the Latin American group, known by its Spanish acronym CLAR, confirmed the remarks and issued an apology, saying it was distressed that its summary had been published.         \n\nLong the subject of speculation in Vatican circles, the term gay lobby had emerged most recently in juicy, unsourced reports in the Italian daily newspaper La Repubblica and a news weekly, Panorama, before the March conclave in which Francis, the former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Buenos Aires, was elected.         \n\nBefore his retirement on Feb. 28, the reports said, Benedict had been worn down by corruption scandals \u2014 including what they said was a network of gay priests inside the Vatican who used blackmail to gain influence and trade in state secrets.         \n\nA secret dossier compiled by three cardinals Benedict had asked to investigate a leaks scandal at the Vatican last year had revealed the network, which also included lay people who were aware of gay clerics inside the Vatican and who were in a position to blackmail them, the reports said.         \n\nVeteran watchers of the Roman Curia were unfazed by Francis\u2019 remarks. One Vatican official, speaking on the traditional condition of anonymity, said he was not surprised that Francis had spoken of a gay lobby, but noted that the summary lacked \u201ccontext and tone.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIf you have an institution as big as the Vatican, there are some who will be homosexual, some maybe actively so,\u201d the official said. \u201cBut whether there\u2019s collusion or internal cooperation, I\u2019ve certainly not been aware of it.\u201d         \n\nOthers said that the remarks were in line with the new pope\u2019s emphasis on openness.         \n\n\u201cA lobby of those who blackmail each other proliferates if you don\u2019t talk about it, if there\u2019s no air,\u201d said Alberto Melloni, a Vatican historian and director of the John XXIII Foundation for Religious Studies in Bologna, a liberal Catholic research institute. \u201cHe\u2019s right to talk about it, it breaks the mechanism in which omert\u00e0 favors the use of blackmail. If no one talks about it, it\u2019s a powerful weapon. In that way, he\u2019s cut the issue down to size and conveys the sense that reforming the Curia is easy.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThis is a question of blackmail and blackmailability, not homosexuality,\u201d he added.         \n\nTwo of the biggest internal threats to Benedict\u2019s papacy, including a scandal of leaked documents, were driven by factions within the Vatican who used leaked information to vie for power. Those scandals contributed to Benedict\u2019s decision to retire.         \n\nWriting in La Repubblica on Tuesday, the Vatican expert Paolo Rodari said that Francis had also mentioned the gay lobby in a meeting last month with bishops from Sicily.         \n\nIn the summary of Francis\u2019s remarks to the Latin American group, the pope said that he was moving ahead with improving Vatican governance, including with the committee of eight cardinals that he named in April. \u201cI am very disorganized, I have never been good at this,\u201d Francis is quoted as saying. \u201cBut the cardinals of the commission will move it forward.\u201d         \n\nIn its statement, CLAR added that it had not made a recording of Francis\u2019s remarks, but that those present, a half-dozen men and women, had written a summary of his points for their personal use. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that based on this, one cannot attribute with certainty to the Holy Father singular expressions in the text, but just the general sense,\u201d the statement said.         \n\nThe summary also quoted the pope as saying that he had not imagined he would be elected pope. He said he had come to Rome \u201conly with the necessary clothes, I washed them at night, and suddenly this ... And I did not have any chance!\u201d the summary read. \u201cIn the London betting houses I was in 44th place, look at that, the one who bet on me won a lot, of course...! This does not come from me,\u201d he added, indicating it had been God\u2019s will.
