{"headline": "Week 5 N.F.L. Matchups", "body": "\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nWhen you think of the Saints, you probably picture a high-octane offense trying to cover up for their porous defense. When you picture the Bears, you probably see a suffocating defense forcing highlight-reel turnovers while their offense shuffles on and off the field without scoring.         \n\nSo far this season, Chicago has put up more points a game than New Orleans, whose defense, a year after setting an N.F.L. record for yards allowed, has given up fewer than half as many points a game as the Bears.         \n\nIt has certainly made for an interesting start for these teams, as the Saints seem to have regained the mojo they had in their 2009  \n championship season and the Bears, despite a solid record, must be wondering what is wrong.         \n\nLast season, members of the Chicago defense, having had enough of watching the offense struggle, declared they would take care of scoring themselves. To a large extent they succeeded, with the Bears\u2019 defense accounting for 35 forced fumbles and 24 interceptions, scoring touchdowns on nine turnovers.         \n\nThis season, they are still getting turnovers and defensive touchdowns, but with no pass rush to speak of \u2014 Chicago has six sacks in four games \u2014 the Bears are being burned for an average of 278 passing yards a game. Their 3-0 start was exciting, but the team is allowing an unacceptable 28.5 points a game.         \n\nNew Orleans averaged 338 yards a game through the air, and will probably pad that statistic against Chicago, even if the price is a few turnovers.         \n\nPick: Saints         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nTony Romo is on pace for 32 touchdown passes, which would be second-highest season total by a Cowboys quarterback; he had 36 in 2007. Peyton Manning is on pace to have 32 touchdown passes by Denver\u2019s eighth game.         \n\nIt has been an uneven season for Dallas, with a 2-0 record at home and 0-2 record on the road. But with a secondary that has allowed 305 yards a game through the air, it could get ugly against a Broncos offense that is firing on all cylinders.         \n\nThe one hope for the Cowboys, who are a heavy underdog despite playing with a significant home-field advantage, is that the Broncos\u2019 defense, which has been just as bad as their own, allows Romo to keep up in what is sure to be a shootout.         \n\nPick: Broncos         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nThe legend of Richard Sherman continues to grow. In a game that seemed unwinnable, with Seattle trailing Houston, 20-6, through three quarters, the Seahawks pulled to 7 behind with a Marshawn Lynch touchdown run in the fourth quarter. Then Sherman, the league\u2019s best cornerback, stepped in front of a Matt Schaub pass as if he were the intended receiver, returning it 58 yards for a touchdown. Afterward, he contended that he had known what was coming, having intercepted a similar pass in practice.         \n\nThe Seahawks were a fantastic story last season, hampered only by their reputation for struggling on the road. This season, no stadium or deficit seems an insurmountable obstacle.         \n\nBut Indianapolis is no longer a one-trick pony. The Colts\u2019 defense allowed just 10 points over the last two games, including a win over San Francisco, the defending N.F.C. champion.         \n\nIf the Seahawks can beat the Colts in Indianapolis, it will be time to call them the best team in the N.F.C.         \n\nPick: Seahawks         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nThese teams were considered Super Bowl contenders before the season, but each has allowed more points a game than it has scored. A lot of the early-season inconsistency has to do with Arian Foster\u2019s slow recovery from injuries, and Frank Gore\u2019s being underused.         \n\nFoster and Gore, the star running backs, got back to what they do best last week. Foster had 171 all-purpose yards and a touchdown for Houston in a heartbreaking loss to Seattle. San Francisco rode Gore, and his 153 yards on the ground, to a win over St. Louis.         \n\nAlthough these team will most likely go back to the well and ask their running backs to carry them to victory, the 49ers must also hope that Colin Kaepernick \u2014 hampered by an injury-riddled receiving corps \u2014 can dominate the way he did against Green Bay in Week 1.         \n\nPick: 49ers         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/06/sports/football/week-5-nfl-matchups.html", "date": "2013-10-04", "description": "Chicago has put up more points a game than New Orleans, whose defense, a year after setting an N.F.L. record for yards allowed, has given up fewer than half as many points a game as the Bears."}
