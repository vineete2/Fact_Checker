{"headline": "The Commissars\u2019 Culinary Stamp", "body": "\nThe bread is here.         \n\nIn bustling Brighton Beach, the Brooklyn neighborhood just north of Coney Island, the writer Anya von Bremzen finally found the sour bread of her Moscow childhood.         \n\n\u201cIt has coriander and molasses, and the taste of fermentation,\u201d she said in a bakery there last week, picking up a chocolate-brown loaf with the tangy scent of rye flour. \u201cBread was everything to us.\u201d         \n\nMs. von Bremzen, who was born in Russia near the end of the Khrushchev era, has just published  \n an ambitious food memoir that is also a meticulously researched history of the Soviet Union, complete with agricultural policies, family narratives, cultural shifts and genocidal horrors. \u201cI\u2019d say I was inspired by \u2018War and Peace,\u2019\u00a0\u201d she said matter-of-factly, browsing among the pickled vegetables at a cafe. \u201cWhat Russian writer tackling a big subject wouldn\u2019t be?\u201d         \n\nThe book is also a meditation on culinary nostalgia, not only for traditional Russian foods like black bread and wild mushrooms, but also for forbidden dishes like plump czarist-era pelmeni in Champagne cream sauce, and even dubiously delicious Soviet standards like squishy \u201cFriendship Cheese.\u201d         \n\nSome of today\u2019s post-Soviet nostalgia (like a Brooklyn restaurant, Back in the U.S.S.R., that serves a dish called Lunch for Politburo Members under a life-size golden statue of Lenin) seems unpalatable to Ms. von Bremzen, now that she has studied the bizarre and tragic history of food in the Soviet era.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s breathtaking that there could be a Stalin brand of vodka in my lifetime,\u201d she said, referring to Stalinskaya, a premium Romanian brand whose slogan is \u201cFor the strong ones.\u201d The famines and food shortages that resulted from Stalin\u2019s agricultural policies, which killed millions of Soviet citizens, reverberated through her childhood, and now through her book.         \n\nBorn in Moscow in 1963, Ms. von Bremzen attended a kindergarten for the children of Communist party elites, where she received a state-mandated daily dose of fish oil in a spoonful of Caspian Sea caviar. Her grandfather was a senior Soviet intelligence agent during World War II; her father worked in the Moscow laboratory dedicated to preserving the corpse of Vladimir Lenin, still entombed in Red Square. (He was in charge of making sure the leader\u2019s skin never changed color.)         \n\nBut she lived in the Soviet Union just over a decade; in 1974, in the midst of Leonid Brezhnev\u2019s repressive regime, she emigrated to Philadelphia with her mother, Larisa, who is Jewish. It was around that same time that Brighton Beach became a haven for Russian Jewish \u00e9migr\u00e9s. Even now, English is a second (or third) language on the strip, where Georgian bakeries jostle for space with 99-cent stores and Uighur noodle joints. (Stalin and Mao battled over the Uighurs, Central Asian Muslims whose central city is Kashgar, a crucial midpoint of the spice route that is known for its fragrant, East-West cooking style.)         \n\nNostalgia is visible at every turn in Brighton Beach today, where the rise and fall of the Soviet Union is still playing out. Luxurious supermarkets like Brighton Bazaar are staffed by young Uzbeks and Tajik immigrants, who are leaving Central Asian homelands that had greater wealth as members of the U.S.S.R. than they do now. La Brioche, a bakery that has revived the extraordinary pastry traditions of turn-of-the-century Odessa, stands opposite glossy buildings, behind security gates, that are rising along the waterfront, providing pieds-\u00e0-terre for wealthy Muscovites.         \n\nSome places, like Elza Fancy Food, serve improbable (and sometimes great) hybrids like Uzbek-Korean cuisine, but the food often has a strange, sad Soviet back story. Central Asian dishes like rice plov and lagman noodles, many types of chim-cha (the Northern cousin of kimchi), and a kind of peppery potato kugel called hanum are results of Stalin\u2019s first mass deportations \u2014 the \u201ccleansings\u201d that still cause mayhem today, in places as far away as Chechnya and as near as Boston.
