{"headline": "Virginia\u2019s Attorney General Faces Scrutiny for Ties to Executive", "body": "\nHe first bought the tiny company\u2019s stock after bunking down in its chief executive\u2019s six-bedroom home.         \n\nHe added to his holdings soon after the rollout of a new product that the company hinted could be a cure for Alzheimer\u2019s disease.         \n\nAs the stock reached a 52-week high last year, he sold part of his portfolio for a $4,000 profit.         \n\nKenneth T. Cuccinelli II, Virginia\u2019s attorney general, said that the timing of his ownership of Star Scientific shares reflected nothing more than his own investment analysis.         \n\nStar Scientific and its chief executive have been at the center of an exploding political drama in Virginia as state and federal investigators look into lavish gifts that the executive, Jonnie R. Williams Sr., gave Gov. Bob McDonnell.         \n\nAnd now, despite his efforts to distance himself, scrutiny is growing of Mr. Cuccinelli\u2019s ties to the executive.         \n\nAides to Mr. Cuccinelli, the Republican candidate for governor this year, insisted he enjoyed nothing like the relationship to Mr. Williams that Mr. McDonnell had. Last week Mr. Cuccinelli indirectly condemned Mr. McDonnell, a fellow Republican, for the first time, lamenting, \u201cWhat we\u2019ve all been seeing is very painful for Virginia.\u201d         \n\nThe statement followed a report that Mr. Williams\u2019s gifts to the governor and his family totaled $145,000, and included a Rolex watch, designer clothing and a $50,000 check to Mr. McDonnell\u2019s wife. The gifts were first revealed in  \n.         \n\nMr. Williams, 57, also gave the attorney general $18,000 worth of gifts, including frequent stays at Mr. Williams\u2019s homes outside Richmond and in the Blue Ridge Mountains, according to Mr. Cuccinelli\u2019s financial disclosure statements. Mr. Cuccinelli at first failed to report some gifts, as well as his Star Scientific stock, as required by law, which he has said was an oversight.         \n\nThe attorney general is not known to be a target of the investigations into Mr. McDonnell, including one by a federal grand jury. At no time, the attorney general said, did he receive stock tips from the executive. But Mr. Cuccinelli\u2019s buying and selling of Star Scientific shares raises questions about whether he and Mr. Williams were as distant as campaign aides insist.         \n\nStar Scientific was Mr. Cuccinelli\u2019s only stock holding worth more than $10,000 since he became attorney general, according to his disclosure forms. In at least two cases, his buying and selling was closely timed to vacations he and his family enjoyed as guests of Mr. Williams.         \n\nIn a statement, the campaign said that Mr. Cuccinelli never discussed his stock purchases or sales with Mr. Williams \u201cat any point in time.\u201d         \n\nOn Friday, a Virginia judge ruled that a trial of Mr. McDonnell\u2019s former Governor\u2019s Mansion chef, whose statements to investigators first drew them to Mr. Williams, could proceed in October. The trial, on charges of pilfering food from the governor\u2019s kitchen, will return all the players to the footlights just a few weeks before Mr. Cuccinelli faces Terry McAuliffe, his Democratic opponent, at the polls.         \n\nFor a relative novice at stock picking, Mr. Cuccinelli\u2019s investment in Star Scientific was highly unusual. It is a thinly traded stock in a company that has lost money for a decade. It stayed afloat by selling stock at a discount in \u201cprivate placements\u201d to large investors, whose hopes were repeatedly raised by company promotions about big payoffs.         \n\nIn that sense, Star seems an extension of the personality of Mr. Williams, who has been called a \u201csuper salesman\u201d since his earliest years in business.         \n\nMr. Williams, who declined through a company spokeswoman and his lawyer to comment, repeatedly ran into trouble with regulators. The Food and Drug Administration forced him to stop selling a cigarette called LungGuard over false claims that it blocked carcinogens. The Securities and Exchange Commission collected $300,000 for incorrect claims that a skin cream cured wrinkles.         \n\nFor years the stock of Star Scientific was buoyed by investors led to expect a windfall from a patent infringement suit against the tobacco giant R. J. Reynolds. When a jury ruled against Star in June 2009, the stock plunged 80 percent.         \n\nIt came back the next year as the company aggressively trumpeted a new business \u2014 a dietary supplement derived from a chemical in tobacco to treat Alzheimer\u2019s disease.
