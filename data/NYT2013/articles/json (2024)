{"headline": "Prized for His Aggression, Incognito Struggled to Stay in Bounds", "body": "\nHe was a timid Little Leaguer teased by opponents and belittled by teammates. He was mocked for being pudgy and gentler than the other boys, even though he was bigger than most of them.         \n\nThen, urged by his father, the Little Leaguer fought back, pummeling one of his tormentors, blackening both his eyes.         \n\nThe chunky boy grew up to become a menacing 320-pound N.F.L. lineman who was largely unknown outside football circles \u2014 until he was accused of being a big-league bully.         \n\nRichie Incognito was  \n, his third N.F.L. team in five years, amid allegations that he bullied Jonathan Martin, his teammate on the offensive line who left the team last week and has not returned. The news hardly came as a shock to most of those who had crossed paths with Incognito since his college years. A snarling, tattooed, 6-foot-3 dynamo, Incognito dominated opponents even as he stretched the boundaries of civil conduct during games and in everyday life.         \n\nBut whatever trouble Incognito encountered \u2014 and there were numerous scrapes with the law, with coaches and with teammates from New York to Oregon \u2014 there was always a football team that wanted him. In a game in which intimidation rules, coaches mostly prized Incognito\u2019s aggression and were willing to overlook his other problems.         \n\nBut how did Incognito, plump-cheeked and boyish even in his college photo, transform into a man suspected of terrorizing his own teammate, referring to him publicly as the Big Weirdo? It would be simplistic to point to a childhood fistfight as a turning point, but people from Incognito\u2019s past still remember the teasing he endured as a kid, and the response he delivered.         \n\nThe fight \u201csent the right message to the town,\u201d said Seth Bendian, who gave Richie private baseball instruction near his hometown, Bogota, N.J. \u201cAnd Richie remained a nice, quiet kid.\u201d         \n\nIncognito became more aggressive as his career developed until he landed in Miami, which had a locker room culture that seemed unchecked. Glimpses of that world that have emerged in recent days have ignited a national debate over the fuzzy area between camaraderie and bullying.         \n\nMartin\u2019s lawyer said Thursday that Martin had endured more than a year of physical and verbal abuse, including a threat against his sister. He blamed  \n teammates, but did not single out Incognito. Martin, who reportedly has kept a menacing and racist voice mail from Incognito, is cooperating with an N.F.L. investigation. At the center of it all is Incognito, 30, who has spent virtually his entire adult life struggling to keep his behavior within accepted limits of propriety.         \n\nIf that was a challenge, it could be because his uncompromising aggression and noted mean streak have so often been prized in football.         \n\nIn 2005, less than a year after off-field transgressions ended his college career at Nebraska and Oregon in the same summer, Incognito was selected by the St. Louis Rams in the third round of the draft.         \n\nMike Martz, the Rams coach then, said the team wanted players with attitude. \u201cBecause that\u2019s the way the game is played in the N.F.L., obviously,\u201d Martz said. \u201cThat nastiness is evident, especially in Incognito.\u201d         \n\nThis week, one of his teammates and friends from Nebraska and the Rams, kicker Josh Brown, assessed Incognito differently.         \n\n\u201cThere were rumors that he would barricade himself in his room, signs of depression,\u201d Brown, now with the Giants, said. \u201cThere was fighting and outbursts.\u201d         \n\nBrown shook his head.         \n\n\u201cI know that\u2019s not the whole Richie,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s sad. But it\u2019s in there.\u201d         \n\nIn Bogota, those who knew Incognito in the late 1980s and early 1990s are shaking their heads, too.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the not the nice kid we knew,\u201d said Pat McHale, a former youth baseball coach and the current Bogota mayor. \u201cHis family was strait-laced. His father was the director of umpires.\u201d         \n\nRichie\u2019s father, Richard, a self-described devotee of the artist Norman Rockwell, grew up on the packed streets of Union City, N.J., a gritty landscape not often depicted on a Rockwell canvas. Just as Richie was turning 12, the Incognitos moved to Glendale, Ariz. At Mountain Ridge High School, Incognito, once teased for his size, quickly became the school\u2019s featured athlete. Richie worked hard, but he did lead the team in penalties, according to Jim Ewan, the coach.         \n\nEwan did not expect Incognito to have a controversial future or be labeled a troublemaker.         \n\n\u201cThe first red flag is whatever happened at Nebraska,\u201d he said.         \n\nA lot happened at Nebraska.
