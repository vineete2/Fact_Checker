{"headline": "The Real-Life \u2018Glee\u2019 in Levittown, Pa.", "body": "\nHarry S. Truman High School, set on a slight incline, is a monument to utility, neither inviting nor forbidding. Buffered on three sides by athletic fields, the school, in Levittown, Pa., rises to just one story. Its exterior is brick \u2014 not red but a dull yellow, the color of putty. Inside the front entrance, several trophy cases filled with pictures and other mementos commemorate mostly unsuccessful athletic teams, and a big bulletin board lists the colleges where the current seniors have been admitted. An energetic janitorial staff buffs the floors each afternoon to a high gloss. The classroom clocks tell the right time.         \n\nAs school was ending one afternoon, I walked through the corridors to a far corner of the building and into the classroom of Lou Volpe, the school\u2019s drama director, who four decades ago was my English teacher. His room was furnished with old couches and living-room chairs, donated stuff that otherwise might have gone to Goodwill or landfills. The bookshelves, windowsills, radiators and all other flat surfaces were piled high with anthologies of plays, copies of scripts and videotapes of Broadway productions. Several mobiles hung down from the ceiling, some low enough that a tall person would have to duck under them. As we talked, Volpe walked a circular route around the classroom, straightening and fluffing the upholstery on the couches and chairs, a ritual he performed numerous times a day, always in a clockwise direction.         \n\nIt was distinctly his room, even without the huge banner that said, in red block letters, \u201cLou Is Back.\u201d The sign appeared out of nowhere some years ago \u2014 tacked up to the rear wall when Volpe arrived one morning \u2014 and he knew not to ask too much about its provenance, though word did eventually filter down that some students pilfered it from a local used-car lot where \u201cLou\u201d was apparently one of the salesmen. \u201cI really hope this other Lou doesn\u2019t miss it too much,\u201d he said with a mischievous grin when I asked him about it.         \n\nThe room was beginning to fill up with students arriving to audition for the 2010 fall play. \u201cYo, Volp,\u201d a boy said as he walked past. Another boy breezed in and commented on what looked like a peace sign on his pants. \u201cYes,\u201d Volpe said. \u201cI got these at Woodstock. I was there, you know.\u201d The student laughed, knowing that Volpe would never have been anywhere near the mud and chaos of Woodstock.         \n\nThe more crowded the room got \u2014 meaning the more competition there would be for parts \u2014 the quieter it became. The audition was for \u201cGood Boys and True.\u201d It was a daring choice for a high school, but a typical one for Volpe \u2014 a searing drama in which the captain of a prep school\u2019s football team meets a girl working at a food court in a shopping mall and later that day films them, without her knowledge, having sex. The story moves forward in a series of painful unravelings: the school is scandalized, a family fractures, a gay relationship is revealed, a deep friendship between two boys rips apart. The drama, written by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, a versatile playwright and TV writer now working as a writer and producer for \u201cGlee,\u201d is as much about class, privilege and power \u2014 subjects virtually unexplored in America\u2019s schools, and particularly relevant in Levittown \u2014 as it is about sex. Volpe would be the first to put it on a high-school stage.         \n\nSome 50 students waited in the classroom to compete for six parts \u2014 three female, three male. The dialogue included some talk of colleges, elite schools to which a couple of the characters have applied. One of them is Dartmouth, which the Truman students pronounced DART-mouth, to rhyme with \u201csouth.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s DART-myth,\u201d Volpe pointed out a couple of times, but they kept making the same mistake. Oberlin College and Vassar were equally baffling.         \n\nThe auditions moved quickly, except when Volpe slowed the pace with observations about the material. \u201cThe setting here is a private school, very privileged,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted you to see how the other half lives.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/magazine/drama-truman-high-school.html", "date": "2013-09-13", "description": "How one high-school theater teacher transformed generations of students."}
