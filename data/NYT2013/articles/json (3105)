{"headline": "For Votes, a Common Appeal to the Struggling  Residents in the City", "body": "\nIn search of Democratic mayoral primary voters, I took a humid hike on Monday up the precipitous streets and stairways of Highbridge in the Bronx. A working-class aerie perched above the Harlem River, the neighborhood embraces native-born and immigrant New Yorkers by the thousands.         \n\nI ran into Pablo Rivera, a 49-year-old Dominican immigrant who was hustling home.         \n\nHe has worked for an Acura franchise in Manhattan for 18 years. He\u2019s a union man with benefits; his American dream sounds as if it\u2019s in working order, except that it\u2019s not. His income, like that of most Bronx residents, is a car sliding backward.         \n\n\u201cManagement is bringing in contract workers; they cut us back to four days a week, and no overtime,\u201d he says. \u201cI went from $700, $800 a week to maybe $415 a week.\u201d         \n\nDoes that leave him enough to take in movies? A dinner with friends? His eyebrows wig-waggle; I must be kidding, right?         \n\n\u201cI just want to pay the rent and pay for clothes and books for my 14-year-old son. I\u2019m thinking of going back to driving a taxi.\u201d         \n\nThe Bronx, with about 1.4 million residents, is the city in a microcosm, only in more pain. From 1989 to 2011, inflation-adjusted median income here dropped 23 percent. Of the city\u2019s five boroughs during those years, only Manhattan, sustained by financial-sector helium, had income climb \u2014 by 8 percent.         \n\nBut here, after a fashion, is the good news:         \n\nWhatever their hyperventilations and gone-weak-in-the-knee moments, the mayoral candidates have focused more intently on Pablo Rivera\u2019s city, which is to say the majority, hard-working and too often tumbling-backward New York, than in any election in recent memory.  \n has led the way, and for this he deserves credit.         \n\nBut Comptroller  \n has thumped at this theme no less insistently.  \n talks of being a tenant mayor, stanching the decline in rent-stabilized units and building more affordable housing.  \n talks of pulling more into the middle class, and tempering the upheavals and statistical obsessions that marked public education under Michael R. Bloomberg.         \n\nIt\u2019s too easy to dismiss these candidates as uninspired. An essay on Monday in this newspaper compared this election unfavorably with the 1969 campaign of the novelist Norman Mailer and the columnist Jimmy Breslin.         \n\nI recall as a kid digging their anarchistic provocations, but that campaign was a hip wail wrapped inside a joke.         \n\nMayor Edward I. Koch, now treated as of blessed memory, could claim real accomplishments. He also could be cruel in lancing the unfortunate. Rudolph W. Giuliani, New York\u2019s own Vlad the Impaler, had his inspired moments, like his insistence that crime could be tamed. Then there were the days he called a news conference to announce he was leaving his wife or starting a campaign to extend his term after the Sept. 11 attacks.         \n\nMike Bloomberg of 2001 was a dull speaker who wore an air of entitlement like a favorite fur coat. He became a pretty good mayor but he never lost that coat.         \n\nThe candidates make a show of disemboweling one another. Mr. de Blasio, in a recent e-mail, is called \u201cdeBliar.\u201d Clever, sort of, not really.         \n\nThe bitterness obscures the fact that not much separates them.         \n\nIt is Ms. Quinn\u2019s fate to be lashed forever for her turnaround on term limits. Her turn, as  \n on Monday, was craven \u2014 when Mr. Bloomberg went to her and laid out his plan, she had nothing to say.         \n\nReally?         \n\nMr. de Blasio makes great sport of this. Once upon a time, however, he was no less eager to overturn term limits. He favored accomplishing this not via voter referendum but with a predictable City Council vote.         \n\nAfter overturning term limits, Ms. Quinn and the mayor stood for and won re-election. Detest their cynicism. As a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat this was weak tea.         \n\nMr. de Blasio can claim leadership pulling back on  \n measures, and Mr. Thompson, notwithstanding his actorly histrionics of late, can fairly be described as a latecomer. The candidates differ little now.         \n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Mr. de Blasio, Ms. Quinn and Mr. Thompson acknowledge that even a tightly constrained stop-and-frisk program will result in mostly black and Latino young men being stopped, for the simple reason that violent crime is committed overwhelmingly in communities of color.         \n\nMs. Quinn did herself no favors by resisting for so long the progressive attempt to extend a few sick days to working-class New Yorkers. Mr. Thompson for many months favored sick days, in principle, until he testified before the City Council and came out in favor of the legislation \u2014 if it was delayed for a year after passage.         \n\nEquivocation is perhaps not as synonymous with principle as Mr. Thompson might imagine.         \n\nMr. de Blasio could be more Machiavelli than Eugene Debs. Ms. Quinn could be Tip O\u2019Neill, or a machine hack.         \n\nAll that is certain is the candidates will stumble out of this campaign having thought a lot about the other New York. The University Neighborhood Housing Program wrote a fine report:  \n It advised policy makers: Always think of the Bronx.         \n\nMr. Rivera offered a turn on that advice, before walking uphill to his home: \u201cThey need to remember their promises to us.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/03/nyregion/for-votes-a-common-appeal-to-the-struggling-residents-in-the-city.html", "date": "2013-09-02", "description": "The good news for those New Yorkers who need their help is that the leading Democratic candidates for mayor are focused on them."}
