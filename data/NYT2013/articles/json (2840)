Differences between the Obama administration and the Saudi leadership  \n after Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the head of Saudi intelligence, privately complained to diplomats about the White House\u2019s reluctance to intervene in Syria \u2014 concerns that were later echoed publicly by Prince Turki al-Faisal, a former intelligence chief.         \n\nAt the root of much of the Saudis\u2019 criticism was the perception that President Obama was uncomfortable with exercising power on the world stage, a gnawing worry for Saudi officials who have become increasingly concerned about the role of their nemesis Iran in Syria and elsewhere in the region.         \n\nAs much as American officials sought to dispel such criticism, the fact that the Obama administration has felt it necessary to offer such assurances has highlighted the strains.         \n\nMr. Kerry said at the news conference that Mr. Obama had told him to make clear to Saudi Arabia that the United States would defend the kingdom from external attack \u2014 a public promise that American officials would not have found necessary to make several years ago.         \n\nMr. Kerry also assured the Saudis that he would regularly inform the kingdom about developments in the talks that the United States and other world powers are conducting with Iran on its nuclear program \u201cso there are no surprises\u201d \u2014 another public pledge noteworthy mainly for the fact that it needed to be made to a close ally.         \n\nSeeking to persuade the Saudis that the Obama administration does not take them for granted, Mr. Kerry, in an appearance at the American Embassy here earlier on Monday, described the kingdom as \u201cthe senior player\u201d among Arab nations, a notion he reinforced when, at his news conference, he called Saudi Arabia an \u201cindispensable\u201d partner.         \n\n(Wary of inflaming Saudi sensitivities, Mr. Kerry sidestepped a reporter\u2019s question about whether  \n, casting the debate as one \u201cbest left to Saudi Arabia.\u201d)         \n\nEven the best efforts by American and Saudi diplomats to frame reports of their disagreements as news media hype, however, could not mask their deep differences over how to bring an end to the civil war in Syria.         \n\nMr. Kerry held out the hope that a Geneva peace conference that has yet to be organized might eventually yield a political settlement that would lead President Bashar al-Assad of Syria to relinquish power.         \n\n\u201cAbsent a negotiated solution, we don\u2019t see a lot of ways to end the violence, certainly, that are implementable or palatable to us, because we don\u2019t have the legal authority, or the justification, or the desire at this point to get in the middle of a civil war,\u201d Mr. Kerry said. \u201cAnd I think that has been made very clear.\u201d         \n\nSitting by Mr. Kerry\u2019s side, Prince Saud initially highlighted areas of convergence between Washington and Riyadh.         \n\nBoth the United States and Saudi Arabia, he said, agreed that there was a need for a Geneva peace conference, that the moderate Syrian opposition coalition should be supported and that Mr. Assad should go.         \n\nBut in his later comments, the prince rattled off statistics of those killed and displaced by the war and criticized the United Nations Security Council for failing to authorize international intervention to halt the fighting.         \n\n\u201cIt is the largest calamity that has befallen the world in the present millennium,\u201d he said. \u201cIf that isn\u2019t enough to intervene, to stop the bloodshed, I don\u2019t know what is.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/world/middleeast/kerry-meets-saudi-king-to-smooth-relations.html", "date": "2013-11-04", "description": "Both sides took pains to publicly dispel the notion that the relationship was in danger of collapsing."}
