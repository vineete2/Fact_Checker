{"headline": "Having Starters Can Finish Off an Opponent", "body": "\nBOSTON \u2014 The prevailing theory before the American League Championship Series was that the  \n\u2019 approach at the plate could wear down the  \n\u2019 starters and force them to use their vulnerable bullpen. That is exactly what happened in Game 1.         \n\n\u201cWe achieved what we set out to do,\u201d Boston Manager John Farrell said, \u201cand that was to get in the bullpen in the middle innings.\u201d         \n\nFarrell added, of course, that things did not work out. The assumption was that the Red Sox would have something to show for their disciplined at-bats, but on Saturday, they did not even manage a hit until the ninth inning. They fell, 1-0, to Anibal Sanchez and four relievers in the second 1-0 playoff game of the day.         \n\nIn the afternoon game in the National League, the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Los Angeles Dodgers by that score, despite scratching only two hits. The Cardinals got their run with help from a passed ball and a sacrifice fly.         \n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be fundamentally sound right now,\u201d Boston catcher David Ross said. \u201cThat\u2019s why these games are so hyped, because you know any little thing can change the course of the game.\u201d         \n\nTrue enough, although there are exceptions. The Red Sox made eight errors here in the first two games of the 2004 World Series, against St. Louis, but won both. Boston swept that series with suffocating pitching, allowing just three runs in the final three games.         \n\nThe Tigers\u2019 pitching staff set a major league record for strikeouts this season, and on Saturday the Red Sox fanned 17 times. Boston\u2019s hitters followed their usual formula of working deep counts, slapping foul balls and drawing walks. But they failed to adjust for the strike zone of the plate umpire, Joe West, and took too many borderline pitches.         \n\nThey coaxed six walks from Sanchez and drove him from the game after 116 pitches in six innings. But against Sanchez\u2019s 95-mile-an-hour fastballs and wipeout sliders \u2014 delivered after a deceptive, back-turning windup \u2014 the Red Sox hit just two balls out of the infield.         \n\n\u201cHe stayed on the corners,\u201d Dustin Pedroia said. \u201cHe pitched for the strikeout \u2014 he struck out a lot and he walked a lot. We had opportunities; we didn\u2019t get any hits.\u201d         \n\nSanchez was mortal against Oakland in the division series (four and a third innings, eight hits, five earned runs in a Game 3 loss), but he has thrown a no-hitter before, for the Marlins in 2006, and lost one in the ninth inning this season. He led the A.L. in earned run average, at 2.57, and ranked third in strikeouts per nine innings, with 9.989.         \n\nIn Jon Lester, the Tigers faced a starter who has also thrown a no-hitter. So has Boston\u2019s Game 2 starter, Clay Buchholz, and Detroit\u2019s Game 3 starter, Justin Verlander. John Lackey, who starts Game 3 for the Red Sox, once allowed a hit to the first batter of a game, then retired 27 in a row.         \n\nYou get the idea. Teams make the postseason for a lot of reasons, but shutdown starting pitching is probably most important. Nine of the top 11 teams in starters\u2019 E.R.A. reached the postseason. (The exceptions: the Washington Nationals and, surprise, the Mets.) Only the Cleveland Indians, who lost the wild-card game, finished outside the top 11.         \n\nThose rotations only get tougher in October, because teams rarely have to use their fifth starter. Lester has a 2.24 earned run average in eight career postseason starts, but he actually has a losing record, 3-4, in those games.         \n\n\u201cIn the postseason, with the days off, at least for me, you get so much adrenaline you don\u2019t really worry about how your body feels, or your mechanics,\u201d Lester said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of who\u2019s up, what\u2019s the game plan, what are we trying to do?\u201d         \n\nLester won his first postseason start, in Game 4 of the 2007 World Series in Colorado, to clinch the Red Sox\u2019 last championship. He was 23, a year older than this October\u2019s breakout starting sensation, Michael Wacha of the Cardinals.         \n\nWacha, who lost a no-hitter with two outs in the ninth inning of his final regular-season start, held Pittsburgh without a hit until the eighth inning of Game 4 of the division series, with the Cardinals facing elimination. That was the Pirates\u2019 only hit in a 2-1 loss. They fell meekly in the finale to Adam Wainwright, who worked a complete game.         \n\nThe Tigers\u2019 series with Oakland featured more offensive futility. With Verlander and Sonny Gray dominating Game 2, neither team scored until Stephen Vogt singled home the winning run off Rick Porcello in the bottom of the ninth.         \n\nThe same starters met in the decisive Game 5, a 3-0 Tigers victory in which Verlander did not allow a hit until there were two outs in the seventh. He gave up two hits in eight innings.         \n\nRoss, the Red Sox catcher, called it \u201cunbelievable\u201d to have two 1-0 playoff games on the same day. Then he added, \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t doubt it.\u201d Indeed, while this was the first day in baseball history that included two 1-0 playoff games, low-scoring games are fairly common in October.         \n\nTwo World Series (in 1949 and 1966) have included consecutive games with that score. In the height of the steroid era, in 2001, three of the four division series had a 1-0 game.         \n\nElite starting pitching does not always prevail in October. The light-hitting San Francisco Giants shelled Cliff Lee in the 2010 World Series opener, and did the same to Verlander last fall. Boston had little trouble in the first round with Matt Moore and David Price, two star left-handers for Tampa Bay.         \n\nBut in Game 1 on Saturday, the Red Sox hung a lonely vertical white line under their \u201cH\u201d column on the old left-field scoreboard. The pattern of this punchless postseason continues.
