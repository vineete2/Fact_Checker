{"headline": "Sheriffs Refuse to Enforce Laws on Gun Control", "body": "\nGREELEY, Colo. \u2014 When Sheriff John Cooke of Weld County explains in speeches why he is not enforcing the state\u2019s new gun laws, he holds up two 30-round magazines. One, he says, he had before July 1, when the law banning the possession, sale or transfer of the large-capacity magazines went into effect. The other, he \u201cmaybe\u201d obtained afterward.         \n\nHe shuffles the magazines, which look identical, and then challenges the audience to tell the difference.         \n\n\u201cHow is a deputy or an officer supposed to know which is which?\u201d he asks.         \n\nColorado\u2019s package of gun laws, enacted this year after mass shootings in Aurora, Colo., and Newtown, Conn., has been hailed as a victory by advocates of gun control. But if Sheriff Cooke and a majority of the other county sheriffs in Colorado offer any indication, the new laws \u2014 which mandate background checks for private gun transfers and outlaw magazines over 15 rounds \u2014 may prove nearly irrelevant across much of the state\u2019s rural regions.         \n\nSome sheriffs, like Sheriff Cooke, are refusing to enforce the laws, saying that they are too vague and violate Second Amendment rights. Many more say that enforcement will be \u201ca very low priority,\u201d as several sheriffs put it. All but seven of the 62 elected sheriffs in Colorado signed on in May to a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the statutes.         \n\nThe resistance of sheriffs in Colorado is playing out in other states, raising questions about whether tougher rules passed since Newtown will have a muted effect in parts of the American heartland, where gun ownership is common and grass-roots opposition to tighter restrictions is high.         \n\nIn New York State, where Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed one of the toughest gun law packages in the nation last January, two sheriffs have said publicly they would not enforce the laws \u2014 inaction that Mr. Cuomo said would set \u201ca dangerous and frightening precedent.\u201d The sheriffs\u2019 refusal is unlikely to have much effect in the state: According to the state\u2019s Division of Criminal Justice Services, since 2010 sheriffs have filed less than 2 percent of the two most common felony gun charges. The vast majority of charges are filed by the state or local police.         \n\nIn Liberty County, Fla., a jury in October  \n who had been suspended and charged with misconduct after he released a man arrested by a deputy  \n The sheriff, who was immediately reinstated by the governor, said he was protecting the man\u2019s Second Amendment rights.         \n\nAnd in California, a delegation of sheriffs met with Gov. Jerry Brown this fall to try to persuade him to veto gun bills passed by the Legislature, including measures banning semiautomatic rifles with detachable magazines and lead ammunition for hunting (Mr. Brown signed the ammunition bill but vetoed the bill outlawing the rifles).         \n\n\u201cOur way of life means nothing to these politicians, and our interests are not being promoted in the legislative halls of Sacramento or Washington, D.C.,\u201d said Jon E. Lopey, the sheriff of Siskiyou County, Calif., one of those who met with Governor Brown. He said enforcing gun laws was not a priority for him, and he added that residents of his rural region near the Oregon border are equally frustrated by regulations imposed by the federal Forest Service and the Environmental Protection Agency.         \n\nThis year, the new gun laws in Colorado have become political flash points. Two state senators who supported the legislation  \n in September; a third resigned last month rather than face a recall. Efforts to repeal the statutes are already in the works.         \n\nCountering the elected sheriffs are some police chiefs, especially in urban areas, and state officials who say that the laws are not only enforceable but that they are already having an effect. Most gun stores have stopped selling the high-capacity magazines for personal use, although one sheriff acknowledged that some stores continued to sell them illegally. Some people who are selling or otherwise transferring guns privately are seeking background checks.         \n\nEric Brown, a spokesman for Gov. John W. Hickenlooper of Colorado, said, \u201cParticularly on background checks, the numbers show the law is working.\u201d The Colorado Bureau of Investigation has run 3,445 checks on private sales since the law went into effect, he said, and has denied gun sales to 70 people.
