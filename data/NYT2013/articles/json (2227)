{"headline": "A Reunion, With Apologies for Last Time", "body": "\nTwenty years ago,  \n of McKim, Mead & White\u2019s magnificent 1898 headquarters for the New York Life Insurance Company remarked on the sorry condition of its once-grand interiors. The building, 346 Broadway at Leonard Street, was then as now owned and occupied by the City of New York.         \n\nThis brought forth a stinging reply from the city that the article was unfair, and a promise of improvements. So, it\u2019s past time for the city to ask, in the words of the late Mayor Koch, \u201cHow am I doing?\u201d         \n\nHe would have liked the answer \u2014 unless he needed to buy a stick of gum.         \n\nFounded in 1841, New York Life was by the late 19th century one of the Big Three, the others being Mutual Life and Equitable Life. In 1895 the company brought in McKim, Mead & White to design an enlargement of its headquarters in New York at 346 Broadway.         \n\nWorking on the long, skinny site, from Broadway to Lafayette, between tiny Leonard Street and teeny-tiny Catherine Lane, the architects grafted a new front onto the Broadway side. The all-marble Italian Renaissance design is hardly a masterpiece, and perhaps for that reason seems to have attracted no serious discussion in the architectural press.         \n\nBut in 1897 The New York Tribune boomed that it was \u201cone of the most sumptuously fitted structures\u201d anywhere, adding, \u201cfew of the Old World places ... can compare with its richness of architectural fibre and interior finish.\u201d         \n\nThe architects gave the building a distinctive central tower on Broadway, surmounted by four crouching male figures supporting a giant bronze globe. The globe annoyed the writer  \n, who in 1899 decried the \u201cmisplaced ornament,\u201d saying it looked \u201clike a monument in Greenwood, surmounted by a rat trap\u201d even though \u201cvermin can hardly be troublesome at that altitude.\u201d         \n\nInside, the standard office building was dotted with remarkable spaces. The Leonard Street entrance opens to an impressive double-height room, rich with marble walls, columns and balustrades and particularly fine bronze torchiers.         \n\nAt the east end of the main floor is the vast General Office, with more rich marble, a coffered ceiling and a great free-standing marble safe. Originally, the room was furnished with tellers\u2019 cages, screen-topped to reduce the possibility of any financial hanky-panky.         \n\nIn 1911, a parade of anarchists were just abreast of the Broadway entrance when Patrolman William Reilly tried to take a red banner away from them. According to The Washington Post, the crowd set upon him with cries of \u201cTo [blank] with the law! Murder them!\u201d and crushed him against the marble front of one of the richest financial institutions in the country.         \n\nHe was rescued by reinforcements, who ripped the red banner to shreds.         \n\nIn 1928 New York Life moved to a new building on Madison Square. One hundred armored trucks protected by machine guns transported $677 million in securities uptown.         \n\nAt some point the bronze globe disappeared, and  \n, New York\u2019s clockmaster, says it was removed around 1950. Mr. Schneider, who takes care of the four-faced clock in the tower, has been searching for the \u201crat trap\u201d for years, and last week said he had come across \u201ca promising lead.\u201d         \n\nMcKim, Mead & White\u2019s palace was converted to small offices, and in the 1960s  \n acquired it for a grand civic center improvement project that might have meant razing the building. But the project did not come to fruition, and city agencies began to move in.         \n\nIn 1993 this writer visited the building and found graffiti in the halls and stairwells, damaged floors, and a forest of cheap partitions and pasted-up notices in the General Office. Fluorescent lights obscured the ceiling and surrounding Corinthian columns. An ooze of indifference and neglect permeated the structure, with the crowning insult being what I described as \u201cthe tackiest fake-veneer candy stand left in the city, complete with Beirut-style rolldown steel gates.\u201d         \n\nThis brought a letter of complaint from Kenneth J. Knuckles, then the commissioner of the Department of General Services, who said he took exception \u201cto the spirit\u201d of the article, although he did not challenge any of my observations.         \n\nA recent visit found a new world. It is remarkable how much polished floors, new partitions, cleaned-up walls and a moderate level of maintenance can improve what was once a depressing, throwaway interior.         \n\nOn the top floor, the Health and Hospitals Corporation has done an immaculate in-house restoration of the old executive dining room. All the elevator banks and ceiling ornament have been spruced up, and give the sense that someone is paying attention.         \n\nUnfortunately, the ceiling of the General Office is still lost in a fluorescent glare. And a first-time visitor, distracted by a collapsed ceiling in the Broadway vestibule and by missing and damaged bronze torchiers, may not appreciate the change from 20 years ago. Neither, it turns out, can readers of this column: phone calls asking for permission to photograph the building\u2019s interior were not returned.         \n\nNow the city would like to find a buyer to take over this troublesome landmark. The sale will probably take years, if a suitable buyer can be found at all. But to a new owner, the cost of curing what still remains of decades of neglect will seem relatively trifling, so things are looking up.         \n\nPointing out flaws in our government is like shooting tuna in a teacup, and on reflection this writer apologizes to Mr. Knuckles for his unconstructive, self-righteous tone in 1993.         \n\nHowever, in the most constructive possible way, may I mention that the candy stand, completely intact from two decades ago, still perfectly spoils the Leonard Street entrance?
