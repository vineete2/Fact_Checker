{"headline": "Qatari Riches Are Buying Art World Influence", "body": "\nThe prices have been record breaking, and startling.         \n\nMore than $70 million for Rothko\u2019s \u201cWhite Center\u201d in 2007, a high-water mark for that artist.         \n\nMore than $20 million later that year for a Damien Hirst pill cabinet, then a record for a living artist.         \n\nAnd $250 million for C\u00e9zanne\u2019s \u201cCard Players\u201d in 2011, the highest known price ever paid for a painting.         \n\nGiven the secrecy of the art market, few knew at the time who had laid out such unprecedented sums.         \n\nBut it has become increasingly clear that those masterpieces and many more have been purchased by Qatar, a tiny Persian Gulf country with enormous wealth and cultural ambitions to match: it is buying art at a level never seen before.         \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re the most important buyers of art in the market today,\u201d said Patricia G. Hambrecht, the chief business development officer for Phillips auction house. \u201cThe amount of money being spent is mind-boggling.\u201d         \n\nThe purchasing is directed through intermediaries by Sheika al Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, chairwoman of the Qatar Museums Authority and a sister to Qatar\u2019s new emir. At age 30 she has become one of the most influential players in the art world.         \n\nNo one knows exactly how much Sheika al Mayassa has spent on behalf of her family or the museum authority since she was named chairwoman by her father, the former emir, in 2006. But experts estimate the acquisition budget reaches $1 billion a year and say the Qataris have used it to secure a host of undisputed modern and contemporary masterpieces by Francis Bacon, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol and Jeff Koons.         \n\nWhere all this art will eventually end up remains something of a mystery. But it seems clear that, just as Qatar has used its oil riches  \n with ventures like arming Syrian rebels, its wealth is also being deployed to help the country become a force in the world of culture.         \n\nThis effort to create a first-class contemporary art collection, essentially from scratch, has buoyed the international art market, experts say, and contributed to some of the escalation in prices.         \n\nUntil Qatar\u2019s 2007 purchase, for example, the most expensive Rothko ever sold at auction (\u201cHomage to Matisse\u201d) had drawn $22 million in 2005, less than one-third of the price Qatar paid. In 2011 the $250 million spent for \u201cCard Players\u201d was four times the highest public price ever paid for a work by that artist.         \n\n\u201cWhen they finish their buying program and withdraw from the market,\u201d said David Nash, a New York dealer who spent 35 years as a top executive with Sotheby\u2019s, \u201cthey will leave a big hole which I don\u2019t see anyone else ready to fill at their level.\u201d         \n\nIn recent years the  \n has created three high-profile museums in the capital,  \n, by the architects Jean Nouvel, I. M. Pei and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Bodin. But each of these projects \u2014 a new home for the National Museum of Qatar now under construction; the Museum of Islamic Art; and Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art \u2014 is focused on regional art and artists. So experts expect that a good portion of the Western collection being amassed will become part of a new contemporary art institution in the country, though officials have yet to announce that.         \n\nThe annual acquisition budgets of major museums typically amount to just a small fraction of what Qatar is spending. The Museum of Modern Art, for example, spent $32 million to acquire art for the fiscal year that ended in June 2012; the Metropolitan Museum of Art, $39 million.         \n\nWhile other gulf states like Abu Dhabi and Dubai are also trying to become cultural capitals, those two members of the United Arab Emirates have teamed up with existing institutions \u2014 namely the Louvre and the Guggenheim \u2014 to establish themselves. Qatar, meanwhile, is going it alone.         \n\n\u201cThey see themselves as an international center for many cultures,\u201d said Allen L. Keiswetter, a scholar at the Middle East Institute in Washington. \u201cIt establishes them as another reason to be a destination for travel, for business. If you want to attract people, you need to have a reason to go there.\u201d         \n\nSheika al Mayassa declined to be interviewed for this article, but she has made limited remarks about the role art will play in Qatar\u2019s future.         \n\n\u201cWe are revising ourselves through our cultural institutions and cultural development,\u201d she said in a 2010 TED Talk. \u201cArt becomes a very important part of our national identity.\u201d         \n\nIn an  \n, the sheika suggested that establishing art institutions might challenge Western preconceptions about Muslim societies.
