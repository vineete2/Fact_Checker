Administration officials said the president would only accept such proposals now if Republicans were willing to support increased revenues.         \n\nThe reaction from both sides also demonstrates how little space there is in Washington for a bipartisan deal when it comes to tax and spending issues.         \n\nFor the president, the budget proposal \u2014 which will come two months after he is required by law to release a federal spending plan \u2014 appears to be another attempt to test whether Republicans can accept further tax increases under any circumstances.         \n\n\u201cIt is not the ideal proposal, but the president recognizes, unlike, I guess, Republicans, that we\u2019re not in the business in Washington of getting everything we want,\u201d said Jay Carney, the White House press secretary. \u201cThat does not happen.\u201d         \n\nBut, Mr. Carney added, \u201cthe president believes that we ought to deal with our deficit challenges in a balanced way, and he\u2019s looking for partners on the other side of the aisle who agree with him.\u201d         \n\nTo that end, the president is to have dinner with a dozen Republican senators on Wednesday evening just after he releases his budget.         \n\nThe reaction from Mr. Boehner and other Republicans suggests that a deal remains elusive, in large part because Republicans remain suspicious about how far the president is willing to go in making serious entitlement cuts that would anger his supporters.         \n\nMr. Boehner said that the president had \u201cnever lived up to his rhetoric\u201d about being willing to cut entitlement programs.         \n\n\u201cIn reality, he\u2019s moved in the wrong direction, routinely taking off the table entitlement reforms he\u2019s previously told me he could support,\u201d Mr. Boehner said in his statement.         \n\nRepresentative Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia, the House majority leader, also seemed unimpressed. On CNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Squawk Box,\u201d he said that if the president agreed with Republicans about some entitlement changes, he should agree to make them without additional tax increases.         \n\nMr. Cantor said he did not understand \u201cwhy we just don\u2019t see the White House come forward and do the things that we agree on.\u201d But, he added, \u201cI am in a wait-and-see mode as to whether this White House is really serious.\u201d         \n\nWhite House officials noted that the Social Security inflation proposal was something that Republican leaders, including Mr. Boehner and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, once embraced.         \n\n\u201cThey have been advocated by Republicans,\u201d Mr. Carney told reporters Friday. \u201cIt means Republicans\u2019 being willing to accept what speaker of the House John Boehner said was good policy three months ago \u2014 not an outlandish request.\u201d         \n\nAdvocates of taking action to confront the nation\u2019s debt praised Mr. Obama\u2019s proposals. Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the president\u2019s proposals \u201cpoint the way toward an emerging bipartisan consensus between the administration and Congressional leaders over essential fiscal issues.\u201d         \n\nLiberals, however, are already balking.         \n\n\u201cPresident Obama\u2019s plan to cut Social Security would harm seniors who worked hard all their lives,\u201d said Anna Galland, the executive director of the liberal group  \n. \u201cUnder this plan, a typical 80-year-old woman would lose the equivalent of three months\u2019 worth of food every year. That\u2019s unconscionable.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/06/us/politics/obama-budget-is-dismissed-by-gop-and-attacked-by-left.html", "date": "2013-04-05", "description": "Speaker John A.
