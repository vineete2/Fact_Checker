{"headline": "Victims Push Laws to End Online Revenge Posts", "body": "\nHe was a muscular guy with \u201ckind of a nerdy kind of charm,\u201d Marianna Taschinger recalled, a combination that proved irresistible to an 18-year-old girl in a small Texas town.         \n\nThey dated, broke up, dated again. He asked her to pick out a wedding ring. He also made another request \u2014 that she take nude pictures of herself and send them to him.         \n\n\u201cHe said if I didn\u2019t want to send them to him, that meant that I didn\u2019t trust him, which meant that I didn\u2019t love him,\u201d Ms. Taschinger said.         \n\nThe photos would never be shared with anyone else, she remembers him promising. And she believed him \u2014 until last December, more than a year after the couple broke up, when a dozen nude images of her popped up on a Web site focusing on what has become known as revenge porn. She is suing the site and her ex-boyfriend.         \n\nRevenge porn sites feature explicit photos posted by ex-boyfriends, ex-husbands and ex-lovers, often accompanied by disparaging descriptions and identifying details, like where the women live and work, as well as links to their Facebook pages. The sites, which are proliferating, are largely immune to criminal pursuit. But that may be changing. California lawmakers this month passed the first law aimed at revenge porn sites.         \n\nWith cellphone cameras ubiquitous and many Americans giving in to the urge to document even the most intimate aspects of their lives, revenge porn has opened up new ways to wreak vengeance.         \n\nThe effects can be devastating. Victims say they have lost jobs, been approached in stores by strangers who recognized their photographs, and watched close friendships and family relationships dissolve. Some have changed their names or altered their appearance.         \n\n\u201cSometimes I want to get into a fetal position and cry,\u201d said Ms. Taschinger, 23, who added that she gave up her job at a restaurant and was stalked by a man who sat outside her house in a car.         \n\nBut when victims call the police, they are invariably told there is little to be done. Lawsuits sometimes exact payments from men who post photographs or succeed in shutting down a site. But once the images are online they spread, picked up by dozens or even hundreds of other Web sites.         \n\nWhen Holly Jacobs, a woman in Florida, changed her name to dissociate herself from the photos posted by her ex-boyfriend, she found them linked to her new name. And the owners and operators of the Web sites are in most cases protected by federal law, which largely absolves them of responsibility for material posted by third parties.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just an easy way to make people unemployable, undatable and potentially at physical risk,\u201d said Danielle Citron, a law professor at the University of Maryland, who is writing a book on online harassment.         \n\nAs the sites have increased, legal scholars and women\u2019s advocates have begun to push for criminal penalties for people who post on them. Only New Jersey has a law that would allow for criminal prosecution, although it was not written with revenge porn in mind.         \n\nBut proposals have met opposition from critics who worry that such laws would infringe on the First Amendment. A bill addressing the issue failed in the Florida Legislature this year.         \n\nAnd even California\u2019s law, which on Monday was awaiting Gov. Jerry Brown\u2019s signature, would make only some forms of revenge posting a misdemeanor punishable by jail time or a hefty fine \u2014 applying only to photos taken by others and posted with an intent to cause serious distress.         \n\n\u201cIt has been watered down again and again as it has weaved its way through Sacramento,\u201d said Charlotte Laws, who began pushing for legislation after pictures of her daughter, Kayla, 26, were posted on a site.         \n\n\u201cWhat we really need is federal legislation,\u201d Ms. Laws said.         \n\nWomen who have been victimized by disgruntled exes have filed civil suits based on claims of copyright infringement, invasion of privacy or, in some cases, child pornography.
