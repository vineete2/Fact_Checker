{"headline": "Colum McCann\u2019s Radical Empathy", "body": "\nIn Colum McCann\u2019s apartment, on the ninth floor of an elegant building just off Central Park, there\u2019s a room where he writes that looks as if it were airlifted in from the woods. It\u2019s all rough-hewed floorboards and shelves made of unvarnished pine and two-by-fours and a long, thick cedar slab for a desk. At one end of that desk there\u2019s a space that used to be a closet, but at McCann\u2019s request, the friend who built the office took off the door and put a platform in there, and this is where McCann writes, \u201cin the cupboard,\u201d as he put it. \u201cIt concentrates my vision. No windows, two very tight walls.\u201d He sits on a couple of cushions with his computer on his lap. On the wall beside him are dozens of messages scrawled by friends and kids and fellow writers and some by McCann himself: \u201cWhat is the source of our first suffering? It lies in the fact that we hesitated to speak. It was born in the moment when we accumulated silent things within us.\u201d \u201cKeep yourself away from answers, but alive in the middle of the question.\u201d \u201cStay rotten.\u201d \u201cHi, Dad, I love you.\u201d         \n\nThe medal McCann received for winning the National Book Award in 2009 dangles from one of the shelves. Around the office are scattered various vintage photographs related to the subjects of his books \u2014 one of a group of sandhogs standing in the massive mouth of a subway tunnel (\u201cThis Side of Brightness,\u201d 1988), another of the World Trade Center looming through the clouds over Lower Manhattan (\u201cLet the Great World Spin,\u201d 2009) \u2014 and there\u2019s also a beautiful framed shot of a pair of grime-encrusted shoes.         \n\n\u201cThey belonged to my father-in-law,\u201d McCann said. \u201cHe was wearing them the day the towers fell. He was in the first tower that was hit, the second to fall. He walked down 59 floors and then all the way uptown to our place.\u201d McCann, who is now 48, and his wife, Allison, and their two children at the time (they now have three) lived then on 71st Street. When his father-in-law arrived at their door, their 4-year-old daughter, Isabella, ran into his arms and then instantly recoiled. Was he on fire? she asked. He explained to her that the smell on his clothes was smoke from the buildings that just fell down. No, she said, as if he didn\u2019t understand what she could so clearly sense. You must be burning from the inside.         \n\nMcCann told me that story early one morning in April, as we drove from Manhattan to Newtown, Conn., where he was going to spend the day talking with groups of high-school students who had just finished reading \u201c \n.\u201d A few months earlier, shortly after the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School, an English teacher at Newtown High named Lee Keylock sent McCann a letter explaining that he and a fellow teacher, Michelle Toby, had been searching, somewhat desperately, for a book that might help their students begin to make sense of their terrible shock and grief. Nothing in their curriculum, Keylock said, gave them any kind of map for the place where they all now lived, but he believed that McCann\u2019s novel possibly could. Though the story is set in New York in 1974 \u2014 put in motion by Philippe Petit\u2019s walk across a wire strung between the twin towers \u2014 it was for McCann the product of years of working through his anger and grief after the towers fell, and in its evocation of loss and the improbable ways in which we can sometimes find grace, it is the greatest novel to come out of the World Trade Center attacks. \u201cBottom line, I need your help,\u201d Keylock wrote. \u201cWe need your help.\u201d         \n\n \n what I\u2019m going to say to them,\u201d McCann said on our drive to Newtown. \u201cQuite honestly, I was stunned by their choice of that book. What an honor. \u201d It was a week after the bombings at the Boston Marathon, where several families from Newtown had been sitting in the grandstand at the finish line. I said something about how unfathomable it was, the intrusion of that kind of violence into people\u2019s lives. \u201cExcept it\u2019s not at all unfathomable in so many parts of the world,\u201d McCann said. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing that\u2019s so hard for us to really understand, right?\u201d He grew up in Dublin, where his father was raised. His mother was from County Derry, in the north, and he spent every summer there with his cousins. \u201cThey worked on a farm,\u201d McCann said. \u201cThey weren\u2019t throwing bombs or participating in marches all the time, but at night they went down to the pub, and they talked about these things. I was aware of their affiliations. They were getting stopped on the street at checkpoints, getting their cars dismantled.\u201d His father was a professional soccer goalie and later became a sportswriter for the BBC. McCann remembered the anxiety of traveling to England with him to watch soccer games. \u201cI would go across to football matches with my dad, and he would say: \u2018Be quiet. Don\u2019t say a word.\u2019 \u2018Why?\u2019 \u2018Because you have an Irish accent.\u2019 \u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/magazine/colum-mccanns-radical-empathy.html", "date": "2013-05-30", "description": "Four years after the publication of \u201cLet the Great World Spin,\u201d Colum McCann\u2019s magnificent, cathartic 9/11 novel continues to help people cope with tragedy."}
