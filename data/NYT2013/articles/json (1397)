{"headline": "A Rendezvous With 1,000 Rooms", "body": "\nWhether you think of them as quotidian, or \u201csoaring masonry facades enlivened by decorative details,\u201d as does the  \n, the network of 1910s and 1920s buildings erected over Grand Central\u2019s sunken railroad yards was a remarkable development, unlike anything ever done in New York.         \n\nBut the linchpin of what was called Terminal City, the huge 1913 Biltmore Hotel, is long gone \u2014 with the exception of a clock and a tunnel.         \n\nIt was William J.  \n, an engineer for the New York Central Railroad, who had the idea of using the air rights above Grand Central\u2019s yards to generate revenue, and this idea drove the new terminal, which opened a century ago. One early plan for Park Avenue, which ran over the covered tracks, was for a formal boulevard flanked by grand Washington-style institutions. But the voice of economics prevailed: Park Avenue was developed with apartment houses and office buildings.         \n\nThe St. Paul architects Charles A. Reed and Allen H. Stem won the initial commission in 1903, but soon the well-connected Whitney Warren and Charles Wetmore insinuated themselves as partners, and work was under way in 1911 when Reed died.         \n\nThe day after the funeral, Wetmore secretly approached the railroad and got it to void the initial contract, naming Warren & Wetmore sole architects for all future related work.         \n\nThat was substantial, involving at least a dozen large office buildings and a great hotel right next to Grand Central, from 43rd to 44th Street, between Madison and Vanderbilt Avenues. This was the 26-story Biltmore, the first of Warren & Wetmore\u2019s ill-gotten commissions. In early 1914 The Real Estate Record and Guide described the thousand-room hotel, with a terraced sixth-floor setback on the Vanderbilt Avenue side, as having been designed so as \u201cnot to dwarf the monumental effect\u201d of Grand Central.         \n\nThis was rather a generous judgment, considering that the hotel was five times as high. Madison Avenue was dominated by its great, uninterrupted bulk. The two tall, gawky wings facing Vanderbilt, separated by a light court, suggest colossal diving boards.         \n\nThe Biltmore\u2019s guests could step off their trains, engage a porter for their luggage, and stroll through Grand Central and into an elevator in the hotel basement. Once checked in, they could retreat to the terrace, which had a roof garden, and in some years skating, and must have been refreshing in the days before air-conditioning. The hotel also custom-built some apartments on request. Dau\u2019s New York Blue Book of 1919 gives a Biltmore address for the architect William Rutherford Mead, whose partners Stanford White and Charles McKim had died in 1906 and \u201909, respectively.         \n\nAlthough the usual narrative is that at this time well-to-do families were shifting from private houses into the new apartment buildings, hotels were obviously a third option.         \n\nIn October 1914 hotels all over the city dropped their flags to half-staff when word came that the hotel\u2019s operator, Gustav Baumann, had fallen from the 22nd floor to his death on the terrace. The New York Times reported that he had lost his balance. A partner with John Bowman in the Biltmore operation, Baumann was one of the best known hotel men in New York. He left an estate appraised at $190,000, which seems a comfortable sum, but two years before it had been valued at $4 million. The Times said he had been losing money on both the Biltmore and the Ansonia, which he also controlled.         \n\nStem had sued Warren and Wetmore when he discovered they had gone to the railroad behind his back. In 1920 the Court of Appeals found in his favor, awarding him about $500,000, including 1 percent of the construction cost of the Biltmore.         \n\nAccording to \u201c \n & Wetmore,\u201d by Peter Pennoyer and Anne Walker, Wilgus wrote that he found their underhandedness \u201ctypical of the moral turpitude which marked the course of Warren & Wetmore in their entire relation to the Grand Central Station architecture.\u201d The book also says that Warren was expelled from the American Institute of Architects in 1920; Nancy Hadley, the institute\u2019s archivist, says that Wetmore was never a member, which was unusual for an architect of his stature.         \n\nThe Biltmore, and in particular its clock, became almost as much an institution as Grand Central itself. At Christmastime in 1956  \n in The Times under the headline \u201cCollegiate Zest Is Added to City\u201d that vacationing students were meeting \u201cas they have for decades, under the gold-figured clock.\u201d That custom extended back at least as far as 1923, when a revue at the Waldorf-Astoria included a skit with a song \u201cUnder the Clock at the Biltmore.\u201d         \n\nBy the 1980s, Midtown seemed anything but zesty, just a collection of aging structures far out of fashion. In 1981 the Milstein family closed the hotel, which was rumored to be a candidate for landmark designation. Suddenly, demolition began. Preservation groups scrambled to save some of the interiors, including the Palm Court, which held the clock.         \n\nBut they were not successful, and the brutal red granite 335 Madison Avenue, designed by the firm Environetics, went up in its place. It is hard to imagine, but in another hundred years preservation organizations may promote its preservation, too, just as they are now promoting landmark designation for  \n and other structures in the area.         \n\nThe Biltmore clock was placed in the lobby of No. 335, but has the pickled aspect common to architectural elements divorced from context. For real old-time Biltmoriana, walk around to the 44th Street side. You\u2019ll find a long vehicle ramp, with an arched ceiling of Guastavino tile, that led to the basement of the Biltmore and the connection to Grand Central.\u00a0You can still drive down, but now it\u2019s just a garage.
