{"headline": "2 Democrats Split on Tactics to Fight Military Sex Assaults", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A sweeping Pentagon policy bill that would make significant changes to how the military deals with sexual assault has turned into a battle between two powerful and determined Democrats who have offered competing proposals.         \n\nThe two, Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand of New York and Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, are lobbying fellow lawmakers on the Senate floor \u2014 sometimes when there is no way to gracefully escape \u2014 papering senators\u2019 offices with letters from victims, and nudging them for meetings to press their cases.         \n\n\u201cThis one is near the top,\u201d Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, said when asked to assess the intensity of the in-house campaigns on the legislation, which is scheduled to go before the Senate soon. \u201cI would say they both have very strong opinions.\u201d         \n\nAt issue is how much power military commanders would maintain in sexual assault cases. For many Democrats, the conflict has created an uncomfortable division between the Senate\u2019s women, whose ranks and power have increased significantly since 2012. The choice is particularly difficult for Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, who has feared alienating his female members on legislative issues and is fond of both Ms. Gillibrand and Ms. McCaskill.         \n\n \n measure, which is opposed by top Pentagon leaders, would take sexual assault cases outside the military chain of command and give military prosecutors, rather than accusers\u2019 commanders, the power to decide which cases to try.         \n\nThe measure Ms. McCaskill is pushing, which is supported by the Pentagon and was written in part by Senator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who is the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, would not go as far. The McCaskill approach would strip commanders of their ability to overturn jury verdicts and mandate dishonorable discharge or dismissal for anyone convicted of sexual assault. But it would keep control of court-martial proceedings within the chain of command.         \n\nThe debate has forced members of both parties to ponder a tough choice between measures that pit the desires of Mr. Levin and top military leaders against those of victims\u2019 groups pushing for changes because of the high numbers of military assaults.         \n\nMs. Gillibrand, who has handed out scores of copies of a documentary on sexual assault in the military, keeps a huge whiteboard in her office listing all the senators\u2019 names, ranked by the probability of their support (five is a yes), and has a little celebration with each positive update. On Thursday, she requested a meeting on the issue with Senator Cory A. Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, less than an hour after he was sworn in.         \n\nMs. McCaskill has spent hundreds of hours meeting with military and civilian prosecutors, sexual assault victims and commanders. A former prosecutor, she has pored over thousands of pages of trial transcripts, all to inform her better as she meets with her colleagues.         \n\nMany male senators in both parties appear extremely reluctant to take a position on such an emotionally charged and complex legal issue. \u201cI come down on the side that is against sexual assault,\u201d Senator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming, said as he raced away from a reporter.         \n\nCongress began scrutinizing sexual assault in the military after a recent series of highly publicized cases, including one at the Naval Academy, and after the release of new data from the Pentagon on the issue. On Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year, about 1,600 sexual assault cases in the military were either awaiting action from commanders or the completion of a criminal investigation.         \n\n \n measure failed to pass the Armed Services Committee, but Mr. Reid has said he will allow her to offer it as an amendment to the military spending bill. This has left her to scramble for 59 allies. She has 46 so far, although it remains an uphill battle.         \n\nThe measure Ms. McCaskill is pushing passed the Armed Services Committee in June.
