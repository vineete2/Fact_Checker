{"headline": "Provocateur Comes Into View After Cyberattack", "body": "\nSven Olaf Kamphuis calls himself the \u201cminister of telecommunications and foreign affairs for the Republic of CyberBunker.\u201d Others see him as the Prince of Spam.         \n\nMr. Kamphuis, who is actually Dutch, is at the heart of an international investigation into one of the biggest cyberattacks identified by authorities. He has not been charged with any crime and he denies direct involvement. But because of his outspoken position in a loose federation of hackers, authorities in the Netherlands and several other countries are examining what role he or the Internet companies he runs played in snarling traffic on the Web this week.         \n\nHe describes himself in his own Web postings as an Internet freedom fighter, along the lines of Julian Assange of WikiLeaks, with political views that range from eccentric to offensive. His likes: German heavy metal music, \u201cBeavis and Butt-head\u201d and the campaign to legalize medicinal marijuana. His dislikes: Jews, Luddites and authority.         \n\nDutch computer security experts and former associates describe Mr. Kamphuis as a loner with brilliant programming skills. He did not respond to various requests for interviews, but he has communicated with the public through  \n, which includes photos of himself, a thin, angular man with close-cropped hair and dark, bushy eyebrows, often wearing a hoodie sweatshirt.         \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s like a loose cannon,\u201d said Erik Bais, the owner of A2B-Internet, an Internet service provider that used to work with Mr. Kamphuis\u2019s company, but severed ties two years ago. \u201cHe has no regard for repercussions or collateral damage.\u201d         \n\nMr. Kamphuis\u2019s current nemesis  \n, a group based in Geneva that fights Internet spam by publishing blacklists of alleged offenders. Clients of Spamhaus use the information to block annoying e-mails offering discount Viagra or financial windfalls. But Mr. Kamphuis and other critics call Spamhaus a censor that judges what is or isn\u2019t spam. Spamhaus acted, he wrote, \u201cwithout any court verdict, just by blackmail of suppliers and Jew lies.\u201d         \n\nThe spat that rocked the Internet escalated in mid-March when Spamhaus blacklisted two companies that Mr. Kamphuis runs, CB3ROB, an Internet service provider,  \n a Web hosting service. Spamhaus contended that CyberBunker was a conduit for vast amounts of spam. CyberBunker says it accepts business from any site as long as it does not deal in \u201cchild porn nor anything related to terrorism.\u201d         \n\nMr. Kamphuis responded by soliciting support for a hackers\u2019 campaign to snarl Spamhaus\u2019s Internet operations. \u201cYo anons, we could use a little help in shutting down illegal slander and blackmail censorship project \u2018 \n,\u2019 which thinks it can dictate its views on what should and should not be on the Internet,\u201d he wrote on Facebook on March 23.         \n\nMr. Kamphuis later disavowed any direct role in the so-called distributed denial of service, or DDoS, attack, which spilled over from Spamhaus  \n. He took to Facebook to inform the world that the  \n that threatened to cripple parts of the Web emanated  \n, an ad-hoc, amorphous group set up in January with the aim to thwart Spamhaus, a company it claims uses its \u201ctiny business to attempt to control the Internet through underhanded extortion tactics.\u201d Stophaus, which lists no contact or location for the group, claims to have members in the United States, Canada, Russia, Ukraine, China and Western Europe.         \n\nMr. Kamphuis said Stophaus was not a front for him; he is merely acting as a spokesman.         \n\nNonetheless, the authorities are curious. The Dutch national prosecutor\u2019s office said on Thursday that it had opened an investigation. Wim de Bruin, a spokesman for the agency, which is based in Rotterdam, said prosecutors were first trying to determine whether the DDoS attacks had originated in the Netherlands. Authorities in Britain and several other European countries are also looking into the matter.         \n\nMr. Kamphuis, who is believed to be about 35, is singled out because of his vocal role. \u201cFor the Dutch Internet community, it\u2019s very clear that he has a big role in this, even if there isn\u2019t 100 percent airtight proof that he is behind it,\u201d said J. P. Velders, a security specialist at the University of Amsterdam. \u201cHe could not be not involved. How much is he involved \u2014 that is for law enforcement to figure out and to act upon.\u201d         \n\nGreenhost, a Dutch Internet hosting service, said in a  \n that it had found the digital fingerprints of CB3ROB when it examined the rogue traffic that had been directed at Spamhaus.         \n\nMr. Kamphuis created CB3ROB in 1996 and helped set up CyberBunker in 1999. From 1999 to 2001, he worked on the help desk at a Dutch Internet service provider, XS4ALL, according to one senior manager at the company who declined to be named, citing company policy. One co-worker said Mr. Kamphuis was constantly being reprimanded for hacking into his employer\u2019s computer system. He was known for eccentric behavior; during a company trip to Berlin, the former co-worker said, Mr. Kamphuis refused to travel with his colleagues and rode alone in a bus.         \n\n\u201cSven absolutely hates authority in any form,\u201d this person said. \u201cHe was very smart. Too smart for customers, by the way. Oftentimes they couldn\u2019t understand his technobabble when he tried to help them.\u201d         \n\nAfter leaving XS4ALL, he continued to run his Web hosting business, which was based for a time in a former army bunker in Goes, the Netherlands. Photos on Mr. Kamphuis\u2019s Facebook page show him holding a flag in front of the bunker, like a freedom fighter defending his redoubt.         \n\nCyberBunker still lists its address as the bunker. But Joost Verboom, a Dutch businessman, says the address is occupied by his own company, BunkerInfra Datacenters, which is building a subterranean Web hosting center at the site. Mr. Verboom said CyberBunker and Mr. Kamphuis left the site a decade ago. It is not clear where the servers of CyberBunker and CB3ROB are now.         \n\nAssociates say Mr. Kamphuis moved to Berlin in about 2006, and his Facebook page displays photos indicating his interest in the Pirate Party, a small political movement focusing on Internet issues that holds some opposition seats in Berlin\u2019s city-state government assembly, and in the  \n, a group that discusses computer issues.         \n\nFor a time, CyberBunker\u2019s clients included WikiLeaks and  \n, a Web site whose founders were convicted by a Swedish court in 2009 of abetting movie and music piracy. In May 2010, six American entertainment companies obtained a preliminary injunction in a German court ordering CB3ROB and CyberBunker to stop providing bandwidth to The Pirate Bay.         \n\nSince the attacks, Mr. Kamphuis has given television interviews from what appeared to be an empty Internet cafe or office. In a Russian television interview, he suggested that the people responsible for the attacks were in countries where there were no laws against cyberattacks or no serious enforcement.         \n\nMr. Kamphuis also continued to provoke people in Facebook postings. \u201cThe Internet is puking out a cancer, please stand by while it is being removed,\u201d he wrote.
