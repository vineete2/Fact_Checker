{"headline": "As Hospital Prices Soar, a Stitch Tops $500", "body": "\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 With blood oozing from deep lacerations, the two patients arrived at California Pacific Medical Center\u2019s tidy emergency room. Deepika Singh, 26, had gashed her knee at a backyard barbecue. Orla Roche, a rambunctious toddler on vacation with her family, had tumbled from a couch, splitting open her forehead on a table.         \n\nOn a quiet Saturday in May, nurses in blue scrubs quickly ushered the two patients into treatment rooms. The wounds were cleaned, numbed and mended in under an hour. \u201cIt was great \u2014 they had good DVDs, the staff couldn\u2019t have been nicer,\u201d said Emer Duffy, Orla\u2019s mother.         \n\nThen the bills arrived. Ms. Singh\u2019s three stitches cost $2,229.11. Orla\u2019s forehead was sealed with a dab of skin glue for $1,696. \u201cWhen I first saw the charge, I said, \u2018What could possibly have cost that much?\u2019\u00a0\u201d recalled Ms. Singh. \u201cThey billed for everything, every pill.\u201d         \n\nIn a medical system notorious for opaque finances and inflated bills, nothing is more convoluted than hospital pricing, economists say. Hospital charges represent about a third of the $2.7 trillion annual United States health care bill, the biggest single segment,  \n, and are the largest driver of medical inflation, a new study in  \n found.         \n\nA day spent as an inpatient at an American hospital costs on average more than $4,000, five times the charge in many other developed countries, according to the  \n, a global network of  \n industries. The most expensive hospitals charge more than $12,500 a day. And at many of them, including California Pacific Medical Center, emergency rooms are profit centers. That is why one of the simplest and oldest medical procedures \u2014 closing a wound with a needle and thread \u2014 typically leads to bills of at least $1,500 and often much more.         \n\nAt Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, Daniel Diaz, 29, a public relations executive, was billed $3,355.96 for five stitches on his finger after cutting himself while peeling an avocado. At a hospital in Jacksonville, Fla., Arch Roberts Jr., 56, a former government employee, was charged more than $2,000 for three stitches after being bitten by a dog. At Mercy Hospital in Port Huron, Mich., Chelsea Manning, 22, a student, received bills for close to $3,000 for six stitches after she tripped running up a path. Insurers and patients negotiated lower prices, but those charges were a starting point.         \n\nThe main reason for high hospital costs in the United States, economists say, is fiscal, not medical: Hospitals are the most powerful players in a health care system that has little or no price regulation in the private market.         \n\nRising costs of drugs, medical equipment and other services, and fees from layers of middlemen, play a significant role in escalating hospital bills, of course. But just as important is that mergers and consolidation have resulted in a couple of hospital chains \u2014 like Partners in Boston, or Banner in Phoenix \u2014 dominating many parts of the country, allowing them to command high prices from insurers and employers.         \n\nSutter Health, California Pacific Medical Center\u2019s parent company, operates more than two dozen community hospitals in Northern California, almost all in middle-class or high-income neighborhoods. Its clout has helped California Pacific Medical Center, the state\u2019s largest private nonprofit hospital, also earn the highest net income in California. Prices for many of the procedures at the San Francisco hospital are among the top 20 percent in the country, according to a New York Times analysis of data released by the federal government.         \n\n\u201cSutter is a leader \u2014 a pioneer \u2014 in figuring out how to amass market power to raise prices and decrease competition,\u201d said Glenn Melnick, a professor of health economics at the University of Southern California. \u201cHow do hospitals set prices? They set prices to maximize revenue, and they raise prices as much as they can \u2014 all the research supports that.\u201d         \n\nIn other countries, the price of a day in the hospital often includes many basic services. Not here. The \u201cchargemaster,\u201d the price list created by each hospital, typically has more than ten thousand entries, and almost nothing \u2014 even an aspirin, a bag of IV fluid, or a visit from a physical therapist to help a patient get out of bed \u2014 is free. Those lists are usually secret, but California requires them to be  \n.         \n\nCalifornia Pacific Medical Center\u2019s 400-page chargemaster for this year contains some eye-popping figures: from $32,901 for an  \n study of the heart\u2019s arteries to $25,646.88 for gall bladder removal (doctor\u2019s fees not included) to $5,510 for a simple vaginal delivery (not including $731 for each hour of labor, or $137 for each bag of IV fluid). Even basic supplies or services carry huge markups: $20 for a codeine pill (50 cents at Rite-Aid or Walgreens), $543 for a breast-pump kit ($25 online), $4,495 for a  \n of the abdomen (about $400 at an outpatient facility nearby). Plenty of other hospitals set similar prices.         \n\nDr. Warren Browner, the chief executive officer of California Pacific Medical Center, said that there were good reasons that hospitals charged what they did: They must have highly trained professionals available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. They must constantly upgrade to the latest equipment and building standards to meet patients\u2019 expectations and state mandates. They charge paying or well-insured patients more to compensate for others they treat at a loss.         \n\n\u201cHospital care is extremely expensive to produce and to have available for everyone in the community,\u201d he said, noting that hospitals needed to have a neurosurgeon on call in case a patient turned up with a blood clot on the brain. \u201cWe take every penny of the revenue we earn and use it to build new and better facilities for everyone in the city.\u201d         \n\nSome health economists say that even though most hospitals are nonprofit, they nonetheless are often flush with revenue and guilty of unnecessary spending.         \n\n\u201cHospitals are self-fueling, ever-expanding machines,\u201d said James Robinson, an economist and professor of health policy at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThere is an infinite amount of stuff to buy \u2014 amenities, machines, new wings, higher salaries, more nurses.\u201d         \n\n\u201cBut,\u201d he asked, \u201cto deliver good health care, what do you need?\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nThere is little science to how hospitals determine the prices they print on hospital bills.         \n\n\u201cChargemaster prices are basically arbitrary, not connected to underlying costs or market prices,\u201d said Professor Melnick, the economist. Hospitals \u201ccan set them at any level they want. There are no market constraints.\u201d         \n\nPrices for any item or service are set by each hospital and move up and down yearly, and show extraordinary variability, health economists say. The codeine that costs $20 and the bag of IV fluid that costs $137 at California Pacific are charged at $1 and $16 at the University of California San Francisco Medical Center, across town. But U.C.S.F. Medical Center charges $1,600 for an amniocentesis, which costs $687 at California Pacific.         \n\nAfter each hospital stay or visit, computer programs and human coders and billers use the chargemaster price list to translate the services rendered into a price. Sutter employs more than 1,300 people at a special center in Roseville, Calif., to perform this and other administrative tasks for its hospitals. Emergency room visits typically include separate charges for doctor\u2019s services and for supplies, as well as a \u201cfacility fee\u201d \u2014 the charge for walking in the door.         \n\nOrla Roche\u2019s bill, for example, included $529 for \u201csupplies and devices,\u201d though her mother is perplexed about what those are: Orla left the emergency room with gauze wrapped round her head (under $1 at Internet supply stores), festooned with a pink cartoon sticker. According to the chargemaster price list for California Pacific, a vial of skin glue is billed at $181, a tube of  \n cream at $125.84 and a vial of local anesthetic at $79.73. These items can be purchased for $15.99, $36.99 and $5 on the Internet, though hospitals \u2014 which buy wholesale and in bulk \u2014 pay far less.         \n\nThe bill also included $1,167 for the facility fee, which was classified at Level 3 \u2014 the middle of the scale, though Orla\u2019s treatment was one of the most simple emergency room interventions. At Lenox Hill in New York, Daniel Diaz\u2019s unusually detailed bill for his stitches included $1,828 for emergency room services, $628 for repairing the wound, $571.83 for \u201capplication of a finger splint,\u201d $97.10 for a  \n shot, and $311 for someone to give the injection. At Sparrow Hospital in Lansing, Mich., 2-year-old Ben Bellar\u2019s bill for six stitches, more than $2,000, included $145.20 for \u201cpharmacy\u201d \u2014 a spoonful of ibuprofen and local anesthetic, his mother said.         \n\nEconomists note that hospitals can bill for emergency room care with relative impunity, since injured patients generally rush to the nearest treatment facility. But worried about high prices, even the sick sometimes shop around. When Jamie Burke, 33, a graduate student in North Carolina, came to after she was knocked out during a soccer game in April, she started searching on her smartphone for an in-network hospital as a friend drove.         \n\n\u201cIt was crazy,\u201d she said, \u201cbut luckily I wasn\u2019t unconscious, so I could figure it out.\u201d         \n\nShe is glad she did: Though the hospital billed $5,039, her insurer\u2019s in-network contracted rate was about $2,700. With copays and coinsurance, she owed $600 for the visit.         \n\nThe uninsured are particularly vulnerable to high prices since they have no one to argue on their behalf. When Arch Roberts Jr. got his bill of more than $2,000 for stitches, he explained that he was uninsured and his business had failed during the housing crisis, so he could not afford the fee. The hospital offered him a \u201ccharity care discount\u201d \u2014 a price that was still out of range. \u201cI don\u2019t have $800 to pay them any more than I have $2,000\u201d for three stitches, he said, noting that the hospital has been \u201crelentless\u201d in its collection efforts.         \n\n \n         \n\nOnce perennial money pits, emergency rooms have become big moneymakers for most hospitals in the last decade, experts say, as they raised their fees and \u201cmanaged\u201d their patient mix. California Pacific Medical Center has nearly doubled its emergency room fees since 2005, its chargemaster price lists show.         \n\nCalifornia Pacific\u2019s emergency room is not a trauma center; poor or uninsured trauma patients who require lengthy inpatient stays can strain a hospital budget. And insurers allow emergency rooms to bill more than urgent-care centers for simple procedures like stitches or X-raying a sprained ankle, making such procedures profitable. Indeed, the financial prospects are so appealing that doctors\u2019 groups in Texas are opening free-standing \u201cemergency rooms\u201d that are not connected to hospitals.         \n\n\u201cHospitals see where they\u2019re making money and try to do more of that,\u201d said Dr. David Gifford, a former health commissioner of Rhode Island, who has studied how labs price their tests. He said that laboratory tests and X-rays are priced high and are profitable, though there is no difference in quality from national commercial labs that charge far less. A blood count and blood electrolyte test \u2014 ordered every day for most inpatients and often in the emergency room \u2014 are priced at $259.06 and $293.25 on California Pacific Medical Center\u2019s chargemaster price list. Insurers often pay outside labs less than $10 for the services.         \n\nAnd, like any business, many hospitals try to do fewer services that are not well paid. In 2012, over loud patient protests, California Pacific Medical Center outsourced its kidney  \n unit to  \n, a commercial company, citing decreasing reimbursement. More than five years ago, after Sutter acquired St. Luke\u2019s, a decrepit hospital in a poor neighborhood, it tried to shut the facility and convert it to an outpatient clinic, which often generate scans and other expensive tests. (The City of San Francisco rejected the plan.) It did close the hospital\u2019s acute psychiatric unit, a division that almost always loses money.         \n\n\u201cYou need a Ph.D. in health economics\u201d to understand medical pricing, said Dr. Browner, who has acknowledged that California Pacific\u2019s chargemaster prices might appear high. But he added, \u201cWe have to recoup what it costs to keep open, what it costs to take care of the un- and underinsured and to rebuild.\u201d         \n\nHe said that MediCal, California\u2019s  \n program, pays California Pacific Medical Center only 10 to 20 percent of its actual costs for care.  \n pays about 70 percent, he said, generally with a predetermined flat fee for each admission based on the patient\u2019s diagnosis. In contrast, many private insurers still pay separately for services rendered, based on discounts from the chargemaster prices.         \n\nDr. Browner also pointed to what health care executives call the \u201cSaudi sheikh problem\u201d at some hospitals.         \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t really want to change your charges if you have a Saudi sheikh come in with a suitcase full of cash who\u2019s going to pay full charges,\u201d he said.         \n\nBut how much actual charity care does a hospital like California Pacific Medical Center perform? And are insurers and patients paying hospitals for better quality? Or also for amenities like valet parking, useless medical gadgetry and inflated salaries?         \n\nThough hospitals\u2019 nonprofit status allows them to reap tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in tax benefits, California Pacific Medical Center\u2019s main campuses spent 1.27 percent of their more than $1.1 billion in net patient revenues in 2011 on free care for indigent or uninsured patients, lower than the state average of 2.07 percent, according to  \n compiled by the San Francisco Department of Public Health. The far smaller St. Luke\u2019s branch spent 5.32 percent that year.         \n\nSutter, based in Sacramento,  \n, and four of them are among the top-paid hospital executives in the state. Sutter\u2019s chief executive officer makes more than $5 million. In 2011, Dr. Browner, 62, a distinguished physician who spent much of his career in academics, made more than $1.2 million, according to tax documents.         \n\nCalifornia Pacific, Sutter\u2019s main campus, is in upscale Pacific Heights. It has just broken ground on a $2.7 billion renovation, which includes a new flagship hospital. Though the project was initiated to meet new state earthquake standards, the facility is designed as a sleek glass and marble structure with all private rooms, underground parking and roof gardens with flowers and bees \u201cto enhance the quality of the healing environment,\u201d according to California Pacific Medical Center\u2019s website. Its Facebook page has called it \u201cthe coolest hospital in San Francisco, possibly the country and even the world.\u201d         \n\nConsumers may appreciate \u2014 or demand \u2014 features that contribute to bigger hospital bills. But studies have found no correlation between prices and patient outcomes. A California state rating of hospital services by  \n gave California Pacific Medical Center average scores in most categories, though its surgical-care measures were rated \u201csuperior.\u201d         \n\nIts crosstown neighbor, University of California San Francisco, a nationally ranked academic institution, charges far less per day than California Pacific, when the greater severity of illnesses of its patients is factored in, Professor Melnick said. In fact,\u00a0a recent study in the publication Annals of Surgery, a monthly review of surgical science, found that hospitals with the highest complication rates tended to have higher prices.         \n\nFrom such variations, economists conclude that \u201ccosts\u201d are highly discretionary, noting that hospitals in other developed countries often provide high-quality care, with better outcomes in comparatively no-frills environments. Said Dr. Robinson, the Berkeley health economist: \u201cIf you pay hospitals more, they spend it. If you pay them less, they adjust. The only way to pay less for health care \u2014 is to pay less for health care.\u201d         \n\nHospital officials like to say that their list prices do not reflect what most patients actually pay, because private and government insurers negotiate discounts. Simone Singh, a professor of health management and policy at the University of Michigan, estimated that insurers generally paid 40 to 50 percent of charges. But with powerful chains like Sutter, prices are high and the discounts often are not so generous. Patients are left paying more.         \n\n \n         \n\nFor her three stitches at California Pacific Medical Center, Deepika Singh ended up paying $768.56 \u2014 a lot of money for a 26-year-old retail supply chain manager \u2014 of the $1,813 rate her insurer negotiated for the approximately $2,200 bill. Ms. Duffy owed $1,366 after her insurer\u2019s discount on 2-year-old Orla\u2019s $1,700 bill, since the family had not met its annual deductible. \u201cHow much is that per minute?\u201d she asked.         \n\nAcross California, Sutter hospitals have proved expert at the business of medicine. \u201cOur members are very exercised about Sutter \u2014 it has increased prices disproportionately,\u201d said David Lansky, chief executive officer of the Pacific Business Group on Health, which represents 60 of California\u2019s biggest private employers in its health care negotiations. \u201cSutter has been successful at leveraging their huge size in dictating not just price but contract terms.\u201d         \n\nIts major competitor is Kaiser, a health maintenance organization that runs a closed network of hospitals and doctors. California Pacific Medical Center delivers more than half the babies in San Francisco and is the city\u2019s largest employer after Wells Fargo. Sutter contracts also include \u201cgag clauses\u201d that prevent employers from knowing what rates have been negotiated by their insurers on their behalf, Mr. Lansky said.         \n\nChuck Idelson, a spokesman for the Institute for Health and Socio-Economic Policy, the research arm of the California Nurses Association, said Sutter prices were 40 to 70 percent above its rivals\u2019 for similar services. When Sutter bought Summit Hospital in Oakland in 1999, rates there went up  \n, researchers found. Because of pricing issues, proposed insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act did not initially include Sutter hospitals.         \n\nTerry Miller, 62, a businessman in the Bay Area, got a bill for $117,000 for a two-night stay at California Pacific Medical Center to place a  \n to open one of his heart\u2019s clogged arteries \u2014 a charge that did not include fees for the cardiologist and radiologist. According to the Medicare database, California Pacific Medical Center charged $43,679 for hospitalization to treat a simple  \n and $96,642 to treat a stroke; the Medicare payments for those illnesses were $8,046 and $9,583.         \n\nThe high prices have had a ripple effect across Northern California, allowing smaller hospitals to charge more as well. \u201cSutter is the tallest Sequoia and everyone goes up just underneath them a bit,\u201d said Professor Melnick. He noted that hospital prices in California had more than doubled in the past decade, after adjustment for inflation.         \n\nAnd payouts in the Pacific region for simple emergency room treatments \u2014 stitches, a sprained ankle and an  \n \u2014 were by far the highest in the country, about 50 percent higher than in the Northeast, according to an analysis performed for The Times. by the health care consulting firm Truven Health Analytics.         \n\n \n         \n\nIn theory, health care consolidation can lead to economies of scale, but not if it produces complex supersize systems. Excess administrative costs accounted for about $190 billion of the $2.5 trillion medical bill of the United States in 2009, the Institute of Medicine estimated this year \u2014 money that could be used for other purposes.         \n\n\u201cThere is a big flurry of consolidation and the effects depend on what the objective of the health care system is,\u201d said Orry Jacobs of the health care consulting firm BDC Advisors. \u201cIf the intent is to improve care and bend cost curves, then networks can do so. If the objective is to corner the market and demand higher rates, then that will happen.\u201d Indeed, research shows that today\u2019s hospital mergers tend to drive up prices.         \n\nAnd employers have limited ability to fight back. Sutter operates the only hospital in some California cities.\u00a0And employers have limited ability to fight back. Sutter operates the only hospital in some California cities. Because of pricing issues, fewer health plans offered by the University of California, Berkeley, will include Sutter hospitals in 2014 compared to this year.\u00a0         \n\nAs is often the case in American medicine, patients will decide if they are willing to pay the high price of care. Back home in New York City, Orla Duffy\u2019s head wound has healed nicely without further treatment. Deepika Singh had her stitches taken out at an urgent care clinic, costing $25 with her copay, during a business trip to Washington.         \n\nDaniel Diaz, who had been treated at Lenox Hill, Mr. Roberts and Amy Bernstein had no choice but to visit an emergency room this year for stitches. But they all refused to see a doctor for the follow-up.         \n\n\u201cThe amount was outrageous for the time it took to put them in,\u201d said Ms. Bernstein, 54, a real estate lawyer from Long Island, who cut herself cleaning knives while fixing a kitchen damaged by  \n. \u201cI was so disgusted, I took them out myself.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/03/health/as-hospital-costs-soar-single-stitch-tops-500.html", "date": "2013-12-02", "description": "Hospital pricing is often convoluted, and hospital charges represent about a third of the total United States health care bill."}
