He held out the prospect of more federal student aid if they did.         \n\nSpeaking at the University at Buffalo, where tuition and fees now total about $8,000 per year for New York residents, Mr. Obama said the middle class and those struggling to rise out of persistent financial troubles were being unfairly priced out of American higher education.         \n\n\u201cColleges are not going to just be able to keep on increasing tuition year after year and passing it on to students,\u201d Mr. Obama told an enthusiastic audience of about 7,200 students and others in the university\u2019s auditorium. \u201cWe can\u2019t price the middle class and everybody working to get into the middle class out of college.\u201d         \n\nThe president, who was on the first day of a two-day bus trip across New York and Pennsylvania, said rising prices at colleges were partly driven by the distribution of $150 billion in federal assistance to students. He said colleges that allowed tuition to soar should be penalized by getting less federal aid for their students, while colleges that held down costs should get more of the money.         \n\nHe announced plans to create a federal rating system that would allow parents and students to easily compare colleges. And he said he would urge Congress to pass legislation to link the student aid to the rating system.         \n\n\u201cIt is time to stop subsidizing schools that are not producing good results,\u201d Mr. Obama said to a roar of applause.         \n\nThe president offered his college affordability proposals as part of a campaign to highlight efforts that his administration says will help the middle class.         \n\nSpeaking to reporters on Air Force One, Arne Duncan, the education secretary, said the president\u2019s plan aimed to change incentives for colleges that were not doing enough to keep down costs. \u201cWe want to see good actors be rewarded,\u201d Mr. Duncan said. \u201cWe want to see them get more resources. And when we\u2019re not seeing that kind of commitment, we want to challenge that status quo.\u201d         \n\nHigher education experts generally agreed that the plan was important, but a number found the ratings worrisome. \u201cIt depends on having complete and accurate data, and there are some areas where the Department of Education does have good data, but others where it does not,\u201d said Molly Corbett Broad, the president of the American Council on Education, the largest higher education trade organization.         \n\nFor example, she said, the department\u2019s statistics on graduation rates include only students who start and finish at the same institution. And, she said, it is unclear what leads students and families to the college choices they make.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m all for analytics and analysis, but we just don\u2019t know what information, and how much, helps students and families make good college decisions,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to write an algorithm for how these decisions are made.\u201d         \n\nMr. Obama\u2019s plan is certain to anger some college officials, who argue that their costs are affected by state funding decisions, the rising cost of health care and other factors outside their control. Mr. Duncan said the administration planned to move slowly as it created the ratings system, in part to listen to the concerns of university administrators.         \n\nThe plan requires approval by Congress, and reaction on Thursday tended to fall along party lines. Representative John Kline, Republican of Minnesota and the chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, said in a statement that he was skeptical of Mr. Obama\u2019s proposed rating system.         \n\n\u201cI remain concerned that imposing an arbitrary college ranking system could curtail the very innovation we hope to encourage \u2014 and even lead to federal price controls,\u201d Mr. Kline said. \u201cAs always, the devil is in the details.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/23/us/politics/obama-vows-to-shame-colleges-into-keeping-costs-down.html", "date": "2013-08-22", "description": "Promising to eventually use federal student aid as leverage, President Obama said, \u201cWe can\u2019t price the middle class and everybody working to get into the middle class out of college.\u201d"}
