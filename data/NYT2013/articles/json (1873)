{"headline": "Behind Flurry of Killing, Potency of Hate", "body": "\nLONDON \u2014 From a comfortable couch in his London living room, Sean O\u2019Callaghan had been watching the  \n of terrified people running from militants in an upscale mall in Kenya. Some of those inside had been asked their religion. Muslims were spared, non-Muslims executed.         \n\n\u201cGod, this is one tough lot of jihadis,\u201d said a friend, a fellow Irishman, shaking his head.         \n\n\u201cBut we used to do the same thing,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Callaghan replied.         \n\nThere was the 1976  \n. Catholic gunmen stopped a van with 12 workmen in County Armagh, Northern Ireland, freed the one Catholic among them and lined up the 11 Protestants and shot them one by one.         \n\nMr. O\u2019Callaghan, a former paramilitary with the Irish Republican Army, has particular insight into such coldblooded killing.         \n\nOn a sunny August day in 1974, he walked into a bar in Omagh, Northern Ireland, drew a short-barreled pistol and shot a man bent over the racing pages at the end of the counter, a man he had been told was a notorious traitor to the Irish Catholic cause.         \n\nHistorical parallels are inevitably flawed. But a recent flurry of horrific bloodletting \u2014 the attack in Nairobi that left 60 dead, the execution by Syrian jihadis of bound and blindfolded prisoners, an Egyptian soldier peering through his rifle sight and  \n of a Muslim Brotherhood leader \u2014 raises a question as old as Cain and Abel: Do we all have it in us?         \n\nMany experts think we do. For Mr. O\u2019Callaghan, it was a matter of focus.         \n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing in that moment,\u201d he said in an interview last week, \u201cis not a human being.\u201d         \n\nIt is dangerous to assume that it takes a monster to commit a monstrosity, said Herbert Kelman, professor emeritus of social ethics at Harvard.         \n\n\u201cWe are all capable of such things,\u201d said Mr. Kelman, 86, whose family fled Vienna under the Nazis in 1939. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t excuse anything, it doesn\u2019t justify anything and it is by no means a full explanation. But it\u2019s something that is worth remembering: We are dealing in a sense with human behavior responding to certain circumstances.\u201d         \n\nOvercoming a deep-seated proscription against killing is not easy. In his book \u201cOrdinary Men,\u201d Christopher R. Browning described how a German police battalion staffed with fathers, businessmen and plumbers struggled as they executed thousands of Jews in Poland. How many among them missed at point-blank range. How they vomited and cried in the forest after massacring mothers and their children. How hard they had to work at becoming killers.         \n\nA culture of authority and obedience that supplants individual moral responsibility with loyalty to a larger mission helps loosen the moral inhibition against murder, social psychologists say. So does a routinization of violence, as well as injustice or economic hardship that allows the killer to see himself as the true victim.         \n\nBut perhaps the most important ingredient is the dehumanization of the victims, said David Livingstone Smith, professor of philosophy at the University of New England and author of \u201cLess Than Human: Why We Demean, Enslave, and Exterminate Others.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThinking about your enemies in subhuman categories is a way of creating a mental distance, of excluding them from the human family,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes murder not just permissive but obligatory. We should kill vermin or predators.\u201d         \n\nThe Hutus in Rwanda called the Tutsis cockroaches, the Nazis depicted the Jews as rats. Japanese invaders used the contemptuous term \u201cchankuro\u201d to refer to their Chinese victims during the Nanjing massacre. American soldiers fought barbarian \u201cHuns\u201d in World War I and godless \u201cgooks\u201d in Vietnam.         \n\nIn Northern Ireland, \u201ctaig\u201d was a popular slur for Catholics. Where Mr. O\u2019Callaghan grew up in Tralee, County Kerry, they called Protestants \u201csassanagh,\u201d Gaelic for \u201cforeigner.\u201d         \n\nLater, after The Troubles had started in 1968 and images of Catholics being bombed out of their houses in Belfast flooded the news, creating an army of angry young Catholic men, Protestants, too, became \u201cHuns.\u201d         \n\nSuch labels help, said John Horgan, director of the Center for Terrorism and Security Studies at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, and author of \u201cWalking Away From Terrorism,\u201d a book on experiences of former militants. Still, he said, \u201cThey wrestle with their conscience. They don\u2019t sleep well at night.\u201d It is no coincidence, he said, that terrorist executions often involve hooding the victim or slitting the throat from behind. \u201cWatching the face when you kill someone is a very difficult thing to do,\u201d he said.
