{"headline": "Russia\u2019s Stimulus Plan: Open the Gulag Gates", "body": "\nMOSCOW \u2014 A business owner in Russia has a better chance of ending up in the penal colony system once known as the gulag than a common burglar does.         \n\nMore than 110,000 people are serving time for what Russia calls \u201ceconomic crimes,\u201d out of a population of about three million self-employed people and owners of small and medium-size businesses. An additional 2,500 are in jails awaiting trial for this class of crimes that includes fraud, but can also include embezzlement, counterfeiting and tax evasion.         \n\nBut with the Russian economy languishing, President Vladimir V. Putin has devised a plan for turning things around: offer amnesty to some of the imprisoned business people.         \n\n\u201cThis can be understood in the Russian context,\u201d Boris Titov, Mr. Putin\u2019s ombudsman for entrepreneurs\u2019 rights, said of what is, even by the standards of the global recession, a highly unusual stimulus effort.         \n\nThe amnesty is needed, he said, because the government had \u201coverreacted\u201d to the threat of organized crime and the inequities of privatization and over-prosecuted entrepreneurs during Mr. Putin\u2019s first 12 years in power as president and prime minister.         \n\nRussia\u2019s economy does need help. In the first quarter, growth fell to a rate of 1.6 percent because oil prices are level. And in that economic climate, few Russians seem willing to risk opening a new business that might create jobs and tax revenue for the government.         \n\nMr. Putin told an audience of chief executives at an economic forum, including Michael L. Corbat of Citigroup and Jeffrey R. Immelt of General Electric, that releasing some businessmen would help revive the economy with \u201cthe values of economic freedom and the work and success of entrepreneurs.\u201d         \n\nIn 2010, the police investigated a total of 276,435 \u201ceconomic crimes,\u201d according to the Russian prosecutor general\u2019s office, whose statistics show burglary and robbery are prosecuted less than economic crimes.         \n\nSo many Russian business owners are doing time that support groups have sprung up in Moscow for their families known as \u201cThe 159 Society.\u201d It takes its name from the article on fraud in the criminal code. Rus Sidyashchaya, or Russia Behind Bars, organizes weekly dinners for the wives of imprisoned businessmen.         \n\nRussia\u2019s infamous penal colonies, rural camps swirled in barbed wire, appear today much as they did when Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn wrote \u201cThe Gulag Archipelago\u201d in the 1960s. But at least one of every 10 prisoners today is a white-collar convict.         \n\nIn the \u201czone,\u201d as the prison camps are known in colloquial Russian, the business owners live, as nearly all Russian prisoners do, in squat wood or brick barracks. It is a grim, violent and disease-ridden world, they say.         \n\nThese newcomers are for the most part nonviolent, though many are recidivists. Several indicated in interviews that they did well in prison, having the skills that matter: the ability to boss around other inmates, avoid abuse and bargain with the guards for little extras like cigarette butts or pillows.         \n\nMr. Titov, an amiable former oil products trader who speaks bluntly about corruption in spite of his government job, spends his time combing through the list of economic criminals with a team of lawyers, trying to free as many as possible. \u201cWe fight for every one,\u201d he said.         \n\nOne of those Mr. Titov championed was Ruslan V. Tyelkov, whose short arc from businessman to inmate illustrates both the entrepreneurial spirit that still simmers in Russia and the risks. Mr. Tyelkov, a strapping 32-year-old from Moscow, invested nearly his last ruble to open a wholesale upholstery business that could hardly have gone wrong in Russia: selling leopard-print fabrics.         \n\nIn 2010, Mr. Tyelkov spent the equivalent of $31,000 for 25,000 yards of Chinese-made leopard-print fabric suitable for chairs and sofas. \u201cIt\u2019s very popular here, not only for furniture but cloths, wallpaper, sheets, shoes, bags, everything.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/09/business/global/russias-stimulus-plan-open-the-gulag-gates.html", "date": "2013-08-08", "description": "With tens of thousands of business owners in the gulag system, and with a depressed economy, President Vladimir V.
