{"headline": "Bring Your Lunch to Work", "body": "\nThere are few brown-baggers in the building where I work. This is not because the food in the neighborhood is so great (it isn\u2019t), or because the cafeteria is Google-like (it isn\u2019t), but because many people are either \u201ctoo busy\u201d or too embarrassed to bring their lunch. Somehow one of our oldest and sanest traditions has become a laughingstock: it\u2019s not hip to bring lunch.         \n\nLet\u2019s try to fix that.         \n\nAs a meal, lunch is undeniably tough; most people say that and I recognize it. But something good happens when you make the default a brown bag.         \n\nI am not talking literally about brown bags; you can bring your groovy REI lunchbox, or your authentic Mumbai tiffin carrier (actually, where I work, the people who seem to bring their lunch most often are of South Asian origin) or \u2014 as I tend to do \u2014 your assortment of recycled takeout containers.         \n\nWhatever you pack it in, what happens when you bring your lunch is that you start to see it as primary, and the restaurants and fast-food joints and company cafeterias as backups, rather than the other way around.         \n\nIt\u2019s no major feat, of course, to develop a ham-and-Swiss-on-rye habit and accompany it with a salad and a piece of fruit, in that way producing a lunch that\u2019s cheaper and no doubt of higher quality than almost anything you\u2019re able to buy in your neighborhood. Still, few people seem to do that these days, at least in my circles.         \n\nMore often (this is an observation, not a study), those who bring their lunches are going one of three routes:         \n\nCarrots, celery sticks, apples, a tomato, a banana. Basically a few things they can grab in two seconds and eat without guilt.         \n\nLeftovers. This is obviously the simplest route and, because almost every workplace has a microwave now, an extremely practical and often savory one. To make this work, you may have to hold back at dinner, or cook more than you\u2019re used to, without eating more.         \n\nThen there is the creative assortment that may require last-minute assembly at work. Again, the microwave helps here.         \n\nMy strategy is to try to have all of these things working for me. I\u2019m not above bringing leftover pasta, or stews, or other things that are easy to reheat. I do resort to the grab-and-go style of raw food at least once a week. And I often try (I really do) to pack a few components separately and then ready them for microwaving at lunchtime.         \n\nThe key, as in so much good eating, is having a well-stocked pantry. I\u2019m talking here not only about olive oil and vinegar and soy sauce, the kinds of things that every cook has. And I\u2019m talking not only about tuna and sardines and maybe bread and tomatoes, the staples of many brown-baggers.         \n\nI\u2019m also talking about building blocks, like tomato sauce, a pot of beans (or grains, equally valuable), a pan of roasted vegetables, perhaps even a roast chicken. These are the kinds of elements that you can put together while you\u2019re doing something else \u2014 whether cooking a meal or watching a football game or catching up on e-mail \u2014 and that will last all week, adding substance, flavor and real appeal to whatever else you have lying around. Get that kind of thing going, and you\u2019ll be overwhelmed not by the challenges of putting together a decent lunch before you leave the house but by the possibilities.         \n\nThere\u2019s at least one other decidedly easy way to add character to even the most mundane dishes. That involves creating a fresh sauce of the type that takes little or no cooking (I\u2019ve provided five no-cook types here) and keeps for a few days. You can think of a vinaigrette as the prototype here, but even the kinds of things we might once have thought of as exotic \u2014 soy-ginger dipping sauce! \u2014 are quickly put together using now-common ingredients.         \n\nPlanned leftovers, as opposed to random ones, can make a huge difference. What you can do with a few pieces of cooked chicken or steak, a couple of fish fillets, even a pile of cooked vegetables is nothing short of creating another meal. And there is almost nothing that won\u2019t sleep soundly in the refrigerator, with little or no loss in quality, from any given Sunday until the following Friday.
