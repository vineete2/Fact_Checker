{"headline": "Pastrami on Thanksgiving Turns Heads", "body": "\n \n pastrami: I know it\u2019s not traditional, but it is impressive, delicious and bountiful. Hear me out on this one.         \n\nI grew up in Oklahoma City, where barbecue and smoked meats are pretty much a prerequisite for family gatherings. And yet, as in many families, Thanksgivings around my house included the traditional turkey and ham, which got a little boring year after year. Pastrami brings something different to the table, something that you probably don\u2019t often see.         \n\nThe idea is to keep the prep simple and fairly minimal; the meat takes a long time to cook, but once you have it in the oven or smoker, you don\u2019t have to attend to it, freeing you up to do other things. It easily feeds a large crowd and, since it isn\u2019t your typical Thanksgiving centerpiece, it will be a conversation starter.         \n\nServe it on a large platter along with plenty of hot mustard. It will surely leave a lasting impression on your guests.         \n\nRecipe:  \n         \n\nRecipe:  \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/27/dining/pastrami-on-thanksgiving-turns-heads.html", "date": "2013-11-22", "description": "It easily feeds a large crowd and, since it isn\u2019t your typical Thanksgiving centerpiece, it will be a conversation starter."}
