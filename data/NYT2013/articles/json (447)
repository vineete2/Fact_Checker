{"headline": "Nadal Made a Dangerous Fifth Seed at Wimbledon", "body": "\nWIMBLEDON, England \u2014 The seedings for Wimbledon were announced Wednesday, and there were no surprises: the top five seeds mirrored the top five players in the ATP rankings and were unchanged by the formula tournament organizers use to account for prowess on grass courts.         \n\nNovak Djokovic was named the top seed, followed by Andy Murray, Roger Federer and David Ferrer. Rafael Nadal was seeded fifth, meaning he could face any of the other four as early as the quarterfinals.         \n\nThough all Grand Slam tennis events maintain the right to change seeds, adjustments are rarely made. In 2000  \n after Wimbledon declined to include them in the 16 seeds, which ultimately led to the more transparent formula.         \n\n\u201cMaybe they set up this formula so they could be devoid of controversy, but to me, there\u2019s no human test or no eye test,\u201d said Brad Gilbert, an analyst and coach who thinks Wimbledon should have seeded Nadal higher. \u201cEye test tells me that the last few months, Rafa\u2019s been the best player in the world. And the human test that Rafa\u2019s five times been in the final of Wimbledon, twice winning, three times final. And David Ferrer has never made it past the quarters.\u201d         \n\nThe formula takes the players\u2019 current ranking points total, adds to it 100 percent of points won on grass in the previous 12 months, then adds 75 percent of points earned at the player\u2019s strongest grass court event in the 12 months before that.         \n\nThe formula is not used to determine the women\u2019s seeds, which this year mirror the rankings exactly, adjusting for withdrawals from Venus Williams and Svetlana Kuznetsova.         \n\nThe biggest bounce from the formula was for the Russian Mikhail Youzhny, who was ranked 28th but seeded 20th.         \n\nBut the formula left Ferrer at No. 4 and Nadal at No. 5, despite the vast disparities in their grass court pedigrees and recent form. Ferrer has never made it past the quarterfinals in 10 appearances at Wimbledon, making the final eight for the first time last year and compiling a 20-10 record at the event.         \n\nNadal, by contrast, has reached the final in five of the last seven Wimbledon tournaments, missing only when he skipped the tournament because of knee tendinitis in 2009 and when he was upset in the second round last year by 100th-ranked Lukas Rosol. Nadal won Wimbledon in 2008 and 2010, and has an overall record there of 36-6.         \n\nHe has also had the stronger 2013, winning seven titles and making two additional finals, compiling a record of 43-2. Ferrer is 37-11, including four losses to Nadal, most recently a 6-3, 6-2, 6-3 loss in the French Open final two weeks ago.         \n\nBut because of the formula\u2019s emphasis on 2012 results, Ferrer managed to stay ahead of Nadal. He reached the quarterfinals of Wimbledon and the third round of the Olympics, and won a warm-up tournament in \u2018s-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands. Nadal lost early at events in Halle, Germany, and Wimbledon, and did not play in the Olympics. Nadal has yet to play on grass this year, but Ferrer lost his first match of the grass season in straight sets Tuesday in \u2018s-Hertogenbosch, which does not bode well for his chances at Wimbledon.         \n\nNot only does Nadal become an incredibly difficult potential quarterfinal opponent, but the Big Four now lose the opportunity to play Ferrer at that stage of the tournament. Ferrer has served as something of a punching bag for the group, with a 5-10 record against Djokovic, a 5-7 record against Murray, a 4-20 record against Nadal and an 0-14 record against Federer.         \n\nSeveral of his more recent losses to them have been especially lopsided. In a loss to Nadal in the Acapulco final in February, Ferrer won one game. In the Australian Open semifinals in January, he won five games in three sets off Djokovic.         \n\nFerrer does, however, have winning records against three of his potential quarterfinal opponents, No. 6 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, No. 7 Tomas Berdych and No. 8 Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro.         \n\nFederer, one of the players who could potentially be hurt by a quarterfinal meeting with Nadal, said that Ferrer had earned his seeding  \n and that Nadal should not leapfrog him.         \n\n\u201cClearly it changes the draw, the dynamics of it, but not more than that, really,\u201d he said after winning the tuneup event in Halle Sunday. \u201cI mean, the quarterfinal is not the first round. It\u2019s still far away in the draw, if you think about it.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/sports/tennis/nadal-made-a-dangerous-fifth-seed-at-wimbledon.html", "date": "2013-06-19", "description": "Rafael Nadal, a two-time Wimbledon champion, could face top-seeded Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray, Roger Federer or David Ferrer as early as the quarterfinals."}
