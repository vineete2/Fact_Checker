{"headline": "New Tests for Brain Trauma Create Hope, and Skepticism", "body": "\nRevelations in recent years that thousands of former football players might have severe brain trauma from injuries sustained on the field have set off a rush in the medical community to seize the potentially lucrative market for assessing brain damage. But experts say claims regarding the validity of these assessments are premature and perhaps unfounded.         \n\nMost researchers believe that C.T.E., or chronic traumatic encephalopathy, the degenerative brain disease found in dozens of former N.F.L. players, can be diagnosed only posthumously by analyzing brain tissue. Researchers at  \n have developed a test they assert might identify the condition in a living person by injecting a compound that clings to proteins in the brain and later appears in a PET scan. But some are skeptical.         \n\n\u201cThere has really been so much hype surrounding C.T.E., so there is a real need for making sure the public knows that this type of science moves slowly and must move very carefully,\u201d said Robert Stern, a professor of neurology and neurosurgery at Boston University School of Medicine and a founder of the  \n. He is part of a group that is developing a different biomarker to identify tau, the protein that is a hallmark of C.T.E.         \n\n\u201cMy fear is the people out there who are so much in need, scared for their lives and desperate for information, it might give them false hope,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe debate over the scientific validity of such brain exams was  \n, a Hall of Fame running back for the Dallas Cowboys, and several other prominent former players said they were found to have C.T.E. after taking the experimental test developed by U.C.L.A. Dorsett, 59, told CNN that \u201cthey came to find out I have C.T.E.\u201d and that his memory lapses, short temper and moodiness were \u201call because of C.T.E.\u201d         \n\nDespite what was widely reported as a diagnosis, the experimental test is perhaps years from gaining federal approval. An antidote is even more remote because C.T.E. is a degenerative condition with no known cure.         \n\nThat is why neurologists, researchers and bioethicists question whether the doctors at U.C.L.A. and at TauMark, the company with the exclusive license to commercialize the test, may leave some former players and their families with false hopes or undue worry.         \n\nFor instance, the  \n, which has helped find retired players to take the test, states that the test could soon provide a \u201cclinical diagnosis and summary.\u201d One of the doctors backing TauMark called the test \u201cthe holy grail of C.T.E.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI can see getting awareness and publicity, but this sounds like putting the cart before the horse,\u201d said Dr. John Morris, a professor of neurology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. \u201cIn theory, they\u2019ll be useful. But we don\u2019t know for an individual, does this mean inevitably they will dement? We just don\u2019t know.\u201d         \n\nThe scan for tau is far from the first test promoted as a new window to an emerging medical problem. An array of medical experts is now developing and marketing treatments for former players that include vitamin regimens, strict diets, testosterone treatments and other therapies.         \n\nBernie Kosar, a former Cleveland Browns quarterback, has said that he received oral and intravenous treatment for brain trauma from Rick Sponaugle, the director of the  \n in Palm Harbor, Fla. Dr. Daniel G. Amen, the founder of Amen Clinics Inc., said this year that he had developed \u201can interventional strategy\u201d that would \u201creverse brain damage\u201d in athletes.         \n\nThe search for remedies to the long-term cognitive problems associated with concussions and chronic brain trauma has received great attention not only because N.F.L. players are involved, but also because the health of millions of young football players could be at stake. The N.F.L. is spending tens of millions of dollars on research into concussion-related ailments.         \n\nThe ability to diagnose C.T.E. in living players also has potential legal and financial consequences as former players fight for insurance coverage, workers\u2019 compensation and other medical benefits well after they received their injuries.         \n\nA successful test to identify C.T.E. in living patients could also provide a big payoff for its inventors and rights holders. The tests cost as much as $15,000, but the price would presumably fall as more people signed up for them.         \n\nThe retired players tested at U.C.L.A. said they did not pay for the test. Financing for the first group of tests was paid in part by the  \n, whose co-founder Julian Bailes co-wrote  \n.         \n\nBut quick fixes in medicine are rare, even when fortunes are being spent developing solutions. For C.T.E., which still lacks a clinically accepted diagnosis among living people, let alone a biomarker approved by the Food and Drug Administration, the answers are even more elusive.         \n\n\u201cThe condition is very much under debate,\u201d said Dr. John Trojanowski, a researcher at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cWe need to be patient to get more research to determine what statements we can make about football players\u2019 pathology.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/26/sports/football/new-tests-for-brain-trauma-create-hope-and-skepticism.html", "date": "2013-12-25", "description": "Researchers at U.C.L.A. hope a new test will help them find degenerative brain disease among former football players who are still alive.
