{"headline": "Health Act Embraced in California", "body": "\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 There are radio and television commercials galore, along with Twitter and Facebook posts and scores of highway billboards. There are armies of outreach workers who speak Spanish, Tagalog, Cambodian, Mandarin and Cantonese, all flocking to county fairs, farmers markets, street festivals and back-to-school nights across the state. There are even dinner parties in Latino neighborhoods designed to reach one family at a time.         \n\nWith enthusiastic backing from state officials and an estimated seven million uninsured, California is a crucial testing ground for the success of President Obama\u2019s health care law.         \n\nIt is building the country\u2019s largest state-run health insurance exchange and has already expanded Medicaid coverage for the poor. Officials hope that the efforts here will eventually attract more than two million people who are currently uninsured.         \n\nAnd as the exchange, known as  \n, has begun the painstaking effort to enroll potential customers in the subsidized insurance plans or expanded Medicaid, the public outreach effort here can seem akin to a huge political campaign.         \n\nThe state is spending $94 million to help local health clinics, community groups and labor unions reach residents \u2014 many who have lived without health insurance for years \u2014 and have them complete the often bewildering process of signing up for coverage. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a little bit of everyone doing a lot of different things to get this all together,\u201d said Lisa Hubbard, a director at St. John\u2019s Well Child and Family Clinic in South Los Angeles, which has one of the highest rates of uninsured in the country. \u201cWe\u2019re really going to have to try anything and everything.\u201d         \n\nThe Obama administration is heavily invested in California\u2019s success. It has poured more than $910 million into the effort because California\u2019s uninsured represent an estimated 15 percent of those without insurance nationwide. The state and federal efforts here are yielding results. More than 16,000 applications were completed in the first five days, state officials said, covering more than 29,000 people. An additional 27,000 people have begun filling out applications, numbers that \u201cblew the socks off\u201d initial expectations, said Peter Lee, the executive director of Covered California. While the state initially resisted releasing preliminary numbers, Mr. Lee said officials now planned to provide weekly enrollment updates in an effort to counter the \u201ccontinued drumbeat of doubters and misinformation.\u201d         \n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t derail something when it has already left the station,\u201d Mr. Lee said Tuesday in a news conference in the state capital, Sacramento. \u201cWe are going very strong.\u201d         \n\nWhile the state will collect demographic information from each application, Mr. Lee said it was too early to know what kinds of consumers had enrolled so far. But with most community clinics and local outreach workers still waiting for official approval to begin enrolling people directly, it would appear that only the savviest or most enthusiastic health care consumers are already signing up. While Mr. Lee and other vocal proponents of the health care law liken using the Web site to shopping on eBay, health care officials say the process can make even the most eager consumer feel dizzy with confusion.         \n\n\u201cPeople are really enthusiastic, but they are really unsure about what\u2019s in it for them and what they are going to get,\u201d said Nelson Samayoa, an outreach worker at the Eisner Pediatric and Family Medical Center in downtown Los Angeles, which has a waiting list of 200 people who plan to enroll in Covered California. \u201cEven though there is a lot of information out there, it doesn\u2019t mean people can really access and understand it on their own. They need us to explain it to them.\u201d         \n\nThe state plans to train and certify 20,000 enrollment counselors and 12,000 insurance agents who will be able to explain options to consumers and help them enroll. But so far, just a tiny fraction of those helpers have received official approval, leaving consumers to either sign up on their own through the Web site or state hot line or wait.
