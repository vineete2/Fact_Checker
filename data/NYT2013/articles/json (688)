{"headline": "McIlroy, a Native Son, Divides Ireland", "body": "\nMAYNOOTH, Ireland \u2014 The posters on the grounds of  \n showed Rory McIlroy swinging a club with the words, \u201cWill Irish Eyes Be Smiling?\u201d Fans from all over the island, divided by political loyalties but until recently united in their reverence for McIlroy, flocked here last month to catch a glimpse of him in the Irish Open, his last competitive tuneup before this week\u2019s British Open at Muirfield. What they saw gave them pause.         \n\nMcIlroy\u2019s confidence appeared as fragile as crystal stemware, and there were signs that success had changed him, starting with his reserved parking placard. It was posted a few paces from the Carton House hotel entrance, considerably closer than the spaces set aside for the defending champion, Jamie Donaldson, and the major winners Graeme McDowell, Darren Clarke and Padraig Harrington.         \n\nCentral to McIlroy\u2019s broad appeal are his humble roots in Holywood, a town outside Belfast, and his affable nature. But since becoming the second Irish golfer, after Harrington, to win multiple majors, McIlroy, 24, has distanced himself from his roots, relocating to Florida and  \n and his Dublin-based management team, both instrumental in his rise to No. 1 in March 2012.         \n\nThose moves have many in Ireland questioning his loyalties, a discomfiting state of affairs for McIlroy, who cares what people think of him and strives to be a winning \u2014 and winsome \u2014 entertainer. During the crest of his success last season, McIlroy  \n along the political fault line through Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland by saying he had always felt more British than Irish, a subject he had previously tiptoed around to avoid upsetting either side.         \n\nIt is a knotty situation for McIlroy, a homegrown hero turned global star, who is from Northern Ireland, which shares a border with Ireland, a House of Lords with Britain and a culture with both. The trap on this path could also ensnare the new Wimbledon champion Andy Murray, a Scotsman who  \n at the London Games because his homeland does not field an Olympic team.  \n from Britain, if successful, would make Murray the McIlroy of tennis.         \n\nMcIlroy realizes that there is no diplomatic answer, no compromise other than sitting out the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, when  \n.         \n\n\u201cThis thing goes back hundreds and hundreds of years and there\u2019s wars and battles of all sorts,\u201d he said with a sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s a tricky situation to be in.\u201d He added, \u201cIf I was a bit more selfish, I think it would be an easier decision.\u201d         \n\nSince McIlroy became a worldwide ambassador of sorts with his victory in the 2011  \n, the conversation seems to have shifted. McIlroy\u2019s ascension to No. 1 and arrival as a global pitchman have raised his profile and, with it, his claiming stakes.  \n delivered in Belfast in June, President Obama singled out McIlroy as the embodiment of a thoroughly modern Northern Ireland, the ascendant king of a generation that has transcended its forebears\u2019 three-decade violent struggle, known as  \n.         \n\nBut if anything, the spotlight on McIlroy has awakened the ghosts of Northern Ireland\u2019s past. Patrick Finn, the general secretary of the  \n, the organization that bridged McIlroy\u2019s journey from prodigy to professional, said: \u201cThe public opinion for Rory is not necessarily the way it once was. The public view of him in Ireland has definitely waned given the whole Olympic conversation.\u201d         \n\nIn pubs and cabs and on the Carton House course, McIlroy was variously described as \u201ca spoiled brat\u201d and \u201ca snob,\u201d and hailed as being from \u201ca leafy loyalist suburb.\u201d Desmond Sloan, a retiree from Dublin in McIlroy\u2019s Irish Open gallery, framed the picture starkly when he said it was important that McIlroy cure his swing problems and \u201cget back into a groove as soon as possible\u201d or there will not be the same clamor to claim him.         \n\nOthers took a kinder view.         \n\n\u201cI think as a young kid he\u2019s made a couple of mistakes here and there, but in general his behavior is astonishingly good,\u201d said Paul McGinley, the Irish golfer who will serve as the European captain at next year\u2019s Ryder Cup.         \n\nMcGinley, who witnessed McIlroy\u2019s popularity in the United States at last year\u2019s Ryder Cup, added: \u201cAs Irish people, and certainly for me, sitting back here and watching him on TV, you don\u2019t realize what goes on behind the scenes and what he has to put up with and what he has to deal with. And I think he handles it extremely well.\u201d         \n\nFinn is also a supporter of McIlroy, painting him as a pawn used by people who are not necessarily conversant with the rules of this game.         \n\n\u201cThe Ireland they played for as amateurs is not the Ireland represented by the tricolor,\u201d said Finn, referring to the green, white and orange national flag of the Irish Republic. \u201cIt\u2019s a golfing union that represents the island. When it comes to the Olympics, it\u2019s Graeme\u2019s or Rory\u2019s democratic right to be a British citizen or an Irish citizen. It is citizenship that governs who you can compete for in the Games. It has nothing to do with sports whatsoever.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nIn the tightknit family of Northern Irish golfers, McDowell is the middle child waging a largely futile battle for attention against the older, cigar-chomping, Guinness-hoisting Clarke and the younger, charismatic McIlroy. McDowell, 33, arrived at Carton House with two victories in 2013, but in his pretournament news conference he fielded almost as many questions about the state of McIlroy\u2019s game as his own. If he resents being cast as McIlroy\u2019s keeper, McDowell is too gracious to show it.         \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine what Rory has gone through this year,\u201d McDowell said. He was speaking of McIlroy\u2019s skyrocketing fame in the wake of his five wins worldwide in 2012 and the three global companies, starting with Nike, that he aligned himself with this year.
