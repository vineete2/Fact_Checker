{"headline": "Q. and A. With Bayern Munich\u2019s Arjen Robben", "body": "\nArjen Robben has won nearly every title while playing for club teams in the Netherlands, England, Spain and Germany. One year after missing a crucial penalty kick for Bayern Munich in the Champions League final against Chelsea in Munich\u2019s home stadium, the Allianz Arena, Robben silenced (some) doubters by scoring the winning goal as Munich defeated its Bundesliga rival, Borussia Dortmund, to win the Champions League title at Wembley Stadium last May. Robben, 29, who plays wing for Munich, spoke with Jack Bell of The Times before sustaining an injury against Hertha Berlin in late October.         \n\n \n  \n         \n\n \n Yes, of course, I was very happy. It all came together, I think, for me. It was the perfect night, especially after the disappointment of the season before in the final. It was like a fairy tale \u2014 winning the final at Wembley and scoring in the last minute. It can\u2019t get any better.         \n\n \n  \n         \n\n \n I think we can, and the reasons are that we have a very good team; we have a new coach [Pep Guardiola] and fresh blood [Thiago Alc\u00e1ntara, Mario G\u00f6tze, Jan Kirchhoff]. I think we will have some new ideas, and we try, of course, to continue to play like we did last season. But some new ideas are what keeps everybody sharp, and from that point of view it is very good that we work now with a new coach. Otherwise, maybe we have a little risk of not continuing to be so successful. We have to stay focused and sharp, keep our minds fresh.         \n\n \n  \n         \n\n \n The biggest difference compared to last season in the way we\u2019re playing now is that we\u2019re trying to push forward more, to put our opponent under pressure all the time. I think for us, the biggest change is to try to press forward even higher up the pitch. We have a lot of quality on this team, and now we\u2019re trying to bring it to the next level, pressing the opponent.         \n\n \n  \n         \n\n \n Always if you win prizes and are successful, of course expectations are higher, at Bayern especially. The target of the club every year is to try to win the German league, and of course the Cup. The Champions League for us it is a nice challenge. The Champions League is very difficult \u2014 there are so many big teams in Europe, and one bad day and you can be out. The challenge for us this season is that no other club has won it twice in a row [since the name was changed from the European Cup in the 1992-93 season]. It would be nice.         \n\n \n  \n         \n\n \n I think that all countries have their own style, their own culture and, especially in England, there is a lot of play physical. In Spain, all the teams try to play football with more technique \u2014 not only the first two or four or five; all the clubs try to play with some technique. Football in Germany is also very physical, in the way we keep running and keep going. Also, the speed of the game is very high. And, of course, each country has exceptional teams.         \n\n \n  \n         \n\n \n For me, it has been a privilege that I\u2019ve been able to work with these big coaches. I think that in each stage of your career you need certain things to improve your game and to develop your style of play. I try to learn from each coach because everyone has his own idea, not only in football, but in the mental aspect, which is also very important these days. In Holland, I started with Guus Hiddink [at PSV Eindhoven] at age 18, and I learned a lot from him. In your career you make certain steps with these managers. I think, of course, each manager has an influence, but it is also about yourself as a player \u2014 you have to be very disciplined in training and in games.         \n\n \n  \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/08/sports/soccer/q-and-a-with-bayern-munichs-arjen-robben.html", "date": "2013-11-07", "description": "The wing discusses his winning goal in May\u2019s Champions League final and his thoughts on playing in some of the biggest rivalries in Europe."}
