{"headline": "Searching for Truffles, a Treasure That Comes in Black", "body": "\nACQUALAGNA, Italy \u2014 Six and a half minutes after we set out, Mina found the first black truffle.         \n\n\u201cMina \u2014 Brava! Brava!\u201d yelled Giorgio Remedia, ambling over to his canine hunter as she furiously dug into a patch of moist earth near a hazelnut tree. Using his sharpened hoe, Giorgio \u2014 ruddy complexion, thick ginger hair \u2014 quickly extracted the black truffle, then tossed it to me nonchalantly. It was about three-quarters the size of my palm, black, dirty and pungently aromatic.         \n\nThe friends I had dragged out on my truffle-hunting extravaganza swarmed around me, noses twitching, as we sniffed at our earthy, musky treasure. As far as we were concerned, we could go home now and call it a good day. We had all heard stories of tourists hunting for hours in the woods of Italy or France, coming back with nothing and ending up at some market where they spent thousands of euros for a kilogram of the stuff.         \n\nBut why pity them? They had made their choice, traveling en masse to some overly trampled place like Provence or P\u00e9rigord or Alba, in the Piedmont.         \n\nInstead, we were lucky enough to have found a place far from the crowds, in the little town of  \n, in the off-the-beaten-path Italian province of Le Marche.         \n\n\u201cThis is the democratic tartufo,\u201d said Bruno Capanna, the town\u2019s former-mayor-turned-truffle-entrepreneur, who organized our hunt. With the right dog and hunter, he added, anyone could find tartufi neri, or black truffles.         \n\nAnd for far less cost than usual. Crowing delightedly that our morning hunt had already proved fruitful, my friends and I plowed on deeper into the woods, following Giorgio and Bruno, and, of course, Mina (she of the extraordinary nose). Our first tartufo, now comfy and safe in the bulky left pocket of my hunting vest, jostled against my leg. Unable to resist, I stuck my hand in to make sure it was still there.         \n\nEveryone knows that truffles are hard to find. In the forests of France and Italy, the truffle trade has long been closeted in as much stealth (blame zealous tax collectors and tax-evading hunters) as Colombian cocaine.         \n\nThe world\u2019s most expensive fungi, they develop under mounds of dirt near the roots of oak, hazelnut and other trees, and have been prized for centuries for their pungent aroma and full-on, robust taste. Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, the 18th-century equivalent of today\u2019s celebrity chefs, famously called truffles the \u201cdiamonds of the kitchen.\u201d         \n\nThey are normally about as expensive as diamonds, too. In 2007, one lunatic  \n for a three-pound white truffle found near Pisa, Italy. In the P\u00e9rigord region of France, black truffles routinely go for $5,000 a kilo, or a touch over two pounds.         \n\nMy first experience with the delights of a black truffle was at the hands of the chef  \n, who flew in to Washington a few years ago to cook a dinner at the residence of a foreign ambassador. \u201cWolfgang Puck is in your kitchen?\u201d I exclaimed, and in my haste to meet Mr. Puck, charged noisily through the residence and into the kitchen. There he stood, bent over, shaving a P\u00e9rigord black truffle over a tray of hot, crispy, cheesy, buttery crostini.         \n\nHe gave me one to taste. The combination of what was essentially a hot grilled-cheese sandwich joined with the fragrant, rich, gamy truffle sent me straight into rapture. \u201cHow much does that thing cost?\u201d I asked, gesturing to the fist-size truffle in his hand. He shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t ask.\u201d         \n\nClearly I couldn\u2019t afford it. But I was hooked. A problem, then.         \n\nAcqualagna to the rescue.         \n\nOn a recent vacation in Italy, I visited Urbino, the spectacular renaissance city in Le Marche, where I somehow ended up in a cafe sipping Campari with some locals at twilight. One of them was Bruno, and he was going on about democracy. Then I heard him say something about democracy and the tartufo nero, the black truffle.         \n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I asked.         \n\nHe said nearby Acqualagna was the tartufo capital of Italy.         \n\n\u201cI thought Alba was the tartufo capital.\u201d         \n\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d he protested. Those crooks in Alba had marketed themselves as the truffle capital, he said, and half the time they imported their truffles from Acqualagna.         \n\nFor centuries, Bruno said, the hills above Acqualagna have been known for their truffles, both the summer black and the rarer (and more expensive) winter white, the tartufo bianco.
