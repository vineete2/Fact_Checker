{"headline": "A Stew in Touch With Its Wild Side", "body": "\nSuppose you are craving wild mushrooms. In a perfect world, if you actually did trek into a forest, and knew where to go and knew what to look for, you might happen upon an enclave of golden chanterelles just waiting to be picked. The yellow beauties would jump into your basket at the touch of a pocketknife blade.         \n\nAround a bend, in a grove of pines, you\u2019d stumble over fine, firm porcini \u2014 the regal, highly prized boletus edulis. You have wisely planned ahead and brought along an iron skillet, and some olive oil, garlic and parsley. Oh, yes, and salt, a crusty loaf of bread and a bottle of red wine. Over a fire of twigs, the mushrooms sizzle and, in a moment, an exquisite al fresco meal is ready to share with your fellow foragers.         \n\nWell, a fellow can dream.         \n\nHere in the city, my mushroom-hunting plan is quite a bit different, even if the objective is the same. I want wild mushrooms for dinner, but I don\u2019t want to spend a fortune on them at the store.         \n\nMy compromise is to make a stew using mostly cultivated mushrooms. But I give them a boost of wild flavor in a couple of ways. The first is to make an intense, flavorful broth with a handful of dried porcini. The other is to actually buy some wild mushrooms. A scant half-pound of chanterelles, even if pricey, won\u2019t break the bank. The rest of the rustic stew (call it a ragout if you wish) is made of shiitake, cremini and oyster mushrooms.         \n\nAs it simmers, this saucy, herbaceous mushroom stew gains depth and character. Spooned over pasta or nestled up to a soft mound of polenta, it evokes the comfort of home and the primal in each bite.
