{"headline": "Sebelius Defends Law and Zeal in Push to Insure Millions", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Kathleen Sebelius has been facing down opponents since she was a schoolgirl campaigning for her father \u2014 a gregarious, outspoken liberal Democrat in Cincinnati, then one of the most reliably Republican big cities in the nation.         \n\n\u201cMy father was routinely called a Communist in Cincinnati,\u201d Ms. Sebelius\u2019s older brother, Donald D. Gilligan, said in an interview. \u201cWhen he first ran for City Council, Republicans ran ads against him printed on pink paper in The Cincinnati Enquirer. Kathleen was used to being called bad names from childhood on. When your father is being called a Communist, you take a measured view of that kind of criticism.\u201d         \n\nNow, Ms. Sebelius, 65, the secretary of health and human services, is the No. 1 public advocate for the health care law, the president\u2019s top domestic initiative, and, just like her father, an easy target for Republicans.         \n\nHer job is to deliver health insurance to more than 25 million people, to nudge the nation toward a new era in which health care is a right, not a privilege \u2014 all this over the opposition of Republicans in Congress and in many state capitols, who are poised to pounce on any misstep.         \n\nMs. Sebelius is on the defensive more than ever now that the White House has delayed a major provision of the law that requires larger employers to offer health insurance to full-time employees. Republicans say she has given a far too rosy picture of progress in carrying out the law. And they are demanding that she explain why people should be required to carry insurance next year if employers are not required to offer it.         \n\nIn her zeal to make the health care law work, Ms. Sebelius has tested the limits of her authority. After Congress refused to provide as much as she wanted for a nationwide campaign publicizing the new insurance options, she shuffled money between government accounts and  \n.         \n\nHer actions have riled Republicans like Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a former governor and cabinet secretary who complained that Ms. Sebelius was circumventing Congress in possible violation of federal law.         \n\nShe is defending herself and her fund-raising activities, even as she defends the law.         \n\nMs. Sebelius gets high marks from Democrats for standing up to Republican pressure \u2014 what Representative John F. Tierney, Democrat of Massachusetts, described as \u201can unrelenting effort to delegitimize the law day in and day out.\u201d         \n\nHer father, John J. Gilligan, served one term in Congress \u2014 the historic 89th Congress, which created Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. He lost his bid for re-election to Robert Taft Jr., scion of a powerful Republican family based in Cincinnati. Mr. Gilligan, an early opponent of the Vietnam War, was elected governor of Ohio in 1970, but narrowly lost a bid for re-election after he secured passage of the state\u2019s first income tax.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of her father in Kathleen,\u201d said Mark Shields, the political commentator, who has known the family for more than 40 years, since he managed Mr. Gilligan\u2019s unsuccessful campaign for the United States Senate in 1968.         \n\nMs. Sebelius\u2019s role as health secretary is larger than expected. In passing the health care law, Congress assumed that each state would set up its own regulated insurance marketplace, or exchange. But more than half the states have balked, leaving the job to federal officials.         \n\nThe law greatly expands federal authority over health insurance, but Ms. Sebelius said that as a former state official, she recognized the vital role of states and had tried to give them flexibility.         \n\nInstead of defining a uniform national set of \u201cessential health benefits,\u201d she has allowed each state to specify the benefits that must be provided in 10 broad categories. She is working with states like Arkansas that do not want to expand the traditional Medicaid program but would like to use federal Medicaid money to subsidize the purchase of private insurance instead.         \n\nAnd she agreed to an unorthodox arrangement under which Utah would run an exchange for small businesses while the federal government would run a separate exchange offering insurance to individuals.         \n\n\u201cShe realizes that you need to work with each state on an individual basis because we are all different,\u201d said Gov. Steven L. Beshear of Kentucky, a Democrat. \u201cHer door has always been open.\u201d         \n\nStill, Ms. Sebelius said she did not anticipate the concerted, continuing opposition to the law.
