Costs for Mentally Ill Soar, and Hospitals Seek Better Way", "body": "\nRALEIGH, N.C. \u2014 As darkness fell on a Friday evening over downtown Raleigh, N.C., Michael Lyons, a paramedic supervisor for Wake County Emergency Medical Services, slowly approached the tall, lanky man who was swaying back and forth in a gentle rhythm.         \n\nIn answer to Mr. Lyons\u2019s questions, the man, wearing a red shirt that dwarfed his thin frame, said he was bipolar, schizophrenic and homeless. He was looking for help because he did not think his prescribed medication was working.         \n\nIn the past, paramedics would have taken the man to the closest hospital emergency room \u2014 most likely the nearby WakeMed Health and Hospitals, one of the largest centers in the region. But instead, under a pilot program, paramedics ushered him through the doors of Holly Hill Hospital, a commercial psychiatric facility.         \n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a medical complaint, he\u2019s just a mental health patient living on the street who is looking for some help,\u201d said Mr. Lyons, pulling his van back into traffic. \u201cThe good news is that he\u2019s not going to an E.R. That\u2019s saving the hospital money and getting the patient to the most appropriate place for him,\u201d he added.         \n\nThe experiment in Raleigh is being closely watched by other cities desperate to find a way to help mentally ill patients without admitting them to emergency rooms, where the cost of treatment is high \u2014 and unnecessary.         \n\nWhile there is evidence that other types of health care costs might be declining slightly, the cost of emergency room care for the mentally ill shows no sign of ebbing.         \n\nNationally, more than 6.4 million visits to emergency rooms in 2010, or about 5 percent of total visits, involved patients whose primary diagnosis was a mental health condition or substance abuse. That is up 28 percent from just four years earlier, according to the latest figures available from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality in Rockville, Md.         \n\nBy one federal estimate, spending by general hospitals to care for these patients is expected to nearly double to $38.5 billion in 2014, from $20.3 billion in 2003.         \n\nThe problem has been building for decades as mental health systems have been largely decentralized, pushing oversight and responsibility for psychiatric care into overwhelmed communities and, often, to hospitals, like WakeMed.         \n\nIn North Carolina, the problem is becoming particularly acute. A recent study said that the number of mental patients entering emergency rooms in the state was double the nation\u2019s average in 2010.         \n\nMore than 10 years after overhauling its own state mental health system, North Carolina is grappling with the consequences of a lost number of beds and a reduction in funding amid a growing outcry that the state\u2019s mentally ill need more help.         \n\nIn Raleigh, where the Dorothea Dix Hospital \u2014 a state psychiatric institution that served the area for more than 150 years \u2014 was closed in 2012, mentally ill patients began trickling into hospital emergency rooms.         \n\nHospitals, which cannot legally turn away any patient seeking care, say the influx of psychiatric patients is straining already busy E.R.'s and creating dangerous conditions.         \n\nThis spring, University Medical Center of Southern Nevada in Las Vegas declared an \u201cinternal disaster,\u201d shutting its doors to arriving ambulances for 12 hours, after mental patients filled up more than half of its emergency room beds. A suicidal patient took out a gun and shot herself in the head while in a hospital emergency room in New Mexico in January.         \n\nWith a crisis facing states, communities and hospitals across the country, experts say no clear solution has emerged. St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital Health Center in Syracuse created a separate psychiatric emergency department. Interim LSU Hospital in New Orleans opened a 10-bed mental health emergency room extension six years ago that is typically full.         \n\nBut in Raleigh, the goal is slightly different: keep the psychiatric patients out of the hospital emergency room altogether.         \n\nThe problem facing North Carolina and other states is a legacy of the 1960s, when warehousing of the mentally ill in large psychiatric hospitals was seen as inhumane.
