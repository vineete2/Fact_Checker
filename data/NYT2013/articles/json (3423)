{"headline": "For Quick Return to Postseason, the Yankees Must Renovate", "body": "\nIn 2005, the baseball journalist Buster Olney  \n titled \u201cThe Last Night of the Yankee Dynasty.\u201d He was referring to Nov. 4, 2001, Game 7 of the World Series, when Luis Gonzalez of the Arizona Diamondbacks blooped a single into the outfield, beating the unbeatable Mariano Rivera and signaling the end of the  \n\u2019 five-year domination of the sport.         \n\nAlthough that night indeed represented the end of the dynasty in its pure form \u2014 the Yankees, while often formidable, have since won only one World Series \u2014 the final goodbyes to that era are just now happening, with Mariano Rivera and  \n retiring and a battered  \n, the last player left from 2001, perhaps not far behind.         \n\nBut one other important link to 2001 probably is not going anywhere any time soon.  \n, the general manager of the Yankees in 2001, is still the general manager. And in the wake of everything that happened this season \u2014 the injuries and the poignant farewells, the failure to make the postseason \u2014 it is his task to figure out what to do next.         \n\nCreate another dynasty? Easier said than done, especially when trying to abide by a $189 million salary ceiling to avoid a big luxury tax payment. Rebuild for a year or two, even it means a losing record? Probably not realistic. Find a way to renovate the roster and get right back to the postseason even if a lot of skeptics suggest otherwise?         \n\nThat sounds like a plan, hard as it might be to pull off.         \n\nCashman will have considerable flexibility in creating the 2014 Yankees. The only players on the roster who have guaranteed contracts for 2014 are Mark Teixeira,  \n, Alfonso Soriano, Ichiro Suzuki, Vernon Wells and C. C. Sabathia. For better or worse, this group will be owed $103.9 million next season, or $78.9 million if Rodriguez\u2019s 211-game drug suspension is upheld by baseball\u2019s arbitrator.         \n\nOther players, like Brett Gardner, David Robertson and Ivan Nova, are eligible for arbitration but can be counted on to be back at relatively modest prices. Some pending free agents, like Hiroki Kuroda and Curtis Granderson, may leave. But even if they stay, the Yankees still have holes to fill at three of four infield positions and at least two spots in the starting rotation.         \n\nOne infield spot could, as it is now, be manned by Robinson Cano, the team\u2019s top free agent to be. Cano, a 30-year-old second baseman, is believed to be seeking a contract in excess of $300 million for 10 seasons, a figure the Yankees, burned by the $275 million they gave Rodriguez, are not apt to pay.         \n\nAt one time it would have been unthinkable for a Yankees star in his prime to go somewhere else, but Cano just might, if some other team is willing to pay him a lot more than the Yankees would. And if Cano does leave, the Yankees have no appealing replacement, because the available free-agent second basemen all represent an immense downgrade from Cano.         \n\nThen there is Jeter. The Yankees\u2019 39-year-old captain, he will be in pinstripes next season if he so chooses, by virtue of an $8 million player option that was raised to $9.5 million when he won a Silver Slugger award in 2012. But after Jeter has lost nearly the entire 2013 season to leg injuries linked to his broken ankle in 2012, there is no telling how much Jeter has left.         \n\nIf the Yankees think Jeter can be a regular shortstop in 2014, they can re-sign Brendan Ryan, a defensive whiz, and let him fill in when Jeter needs a break.         \n\nIf they are less sure about Jeter\u2019s ability to stay on the field next season, they could try to acquire a full-time replacement like  \n. A 25-year-old two-time All-Star, Andrus plays the same position as his team\u2019s top prospect, Jurickson Profar, and was placed on waivers this season, an indication that Texas was regretting the eight-year, $120 million contract extension it gave Andrus.         \n\nAny deal for Andrus would involve the Yankees\u2019 taking on that salary commitment, the Rangers\u2019 finding minor leaguers in the Yankees\u2019 system whom they want, and Jeter\u2019s agreeing to spend his last chapter as a Yankee as something other than a shortstop.         \n\nIn looking for someone to potentially replace Rodriguez at third base, the Yankees are not worried about bruising his feelings, because it is clear that he and the team do not like each other much. But if Rodriguez is indeed suspended for much or all of next season, the Yankees will have no obvious replacement, unless they play Jeter at third.         \n\nThe best free-agent candidates for third base will be two players, Mark Reynolds and Kevin Youkilis, who are still Yankees for the moment, and neither represents an attractive choice for next year.         \n\nInstead, the Yankees could try to trade for a third baseman, though such a move would be complicated by the fact that Rodriguez is under contract through 2017 and eventually will almost definitely return to claim his remaining money, whether the Yankees want him back or not.         \n\nSo what do the Yankees do? Their tendency to buy the best talent available every season has created an environment in which every other team seems eager to sign its own players to large contract extensions before they become free agents.         \n\nThat leaves fewer good players for Cashman to pursue to fill out his pitching staff and his infield, and perhaps even to find a new catcher. The minors? Significant help is not on the way. Trades? Cashman may try, but he probably does not have enough young talent to pull off enough good deals.         \n\nSomeday, perhaps, Olney will write a sequel entitled \u201cThe First Night of the New Yankee Dynasty.\u201d But not any time soon.
