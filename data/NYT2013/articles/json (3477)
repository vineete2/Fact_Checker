{"headline": "How Do We Judge Books Written Under Pseudonyms?", "body": "\nEach week in Bookends, two writers take on pressing and provocative questions about the world of books. This week, Francine Prose and Daniel Mendelsohn on what readers\u2019 and critics\u2019 reactions say about pseudonymous works.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \nFrancine Prose \n\nOver a lifetime that lasted from 1760 to 1849, the great Japanese painter Hokusai changed his name roughly 30 times. The final name he chose meant \u201cthe old man mad about art.\u201d I remember reading about this long before I imagined being a writer whose name would be known to anyone outside my family. And I remember thinking, Way to go!         \n\nWho wouldn\u2019t want a new name, a clean slate, a chance to start over? In her entertaining and informative book, \u201cNom de Plume,\u201d Carmela Ciuraru considers the reasons writers (like the convicted embezzler William Sydney Porter, who became the more upstanding O. Henry, and Patricia Highsmith, who signed \u201cThe Price of Salt,\u201d her 1952 lesbian novel, as Claire Morgan) have camouflaged their identities. Advised by the poet Robert Southey that \u201cliterature cannot be the business of a woman\u2019s life, and it ought not to be,\u201d Charlotte Bront\u00eb took the sensible step of publishing, with her sisters Emily and Anne, a volume of poetry supposedly by Currer, Acton and Ellis Bell \u2014 three brothers more hormonally suited to making literature their business. It\u2019s depressingly easy to understand why women of past centuries, or any century, would \u2014 like the Georges, Sand and Eliot \u2014 write under a male name. If I take a pseudonym, it will be George, believe me.         \n\nPseudonyms are especially attractive to fiction writers, whose work (inventing people and seeing the world through their eyes) requires an impersonation, of sorts. Writing under a pen name is like doing an impersonation of someone doing an impersonation. I\u2019ve fantasized about using an alias, but my fantasy mostly entails making a lot of money by writing a quick horror novel. A friend who did something like this says he needed his alter ego, not to conceal his real name but to \u201cbe\u201d that fictitious person, who wrote a scene in which a father cannibalizes a family pet.         \n\nThings are more complicated in this age of branding and consumer loyalty. It\u2019s one thing for a brilliant Japanese artist to change names every few years, but that won\u2019t work for the mayonnaise. Excuse me, where\u2019s the Hellmann\u2019s? Will readers buy a new book by their favorite author if the writer uses a different name? How will critics review a writer they already love or hate, and who is now pretending to be a first novelist? Booksellers who place orders based on an author\u2019s sales record will have to predict the potential of a \u201cnew\u201d writer\u2019s work solely on the book\u2019s merits.         \n\nWell-known writers have tested these waters, with mixed results. The very popular tend to do very well, especially when their fans learn the truth. Those with waning reputations, not so much. In the 1980s, Doris Lessing, whose science fiction had garnered unfriendly reviews, submitted a novel under the name Jane Somers, and her longtime British publisher turned it down. Later, some critics and readers greeted Somers\u2019s work even less warmly than they had received Lessing\u2019s earlier science fiction.         \n\nRecently, there was the highly publicized pseudonym-success story involving \u201cThe Cuckoo\u2019s Calling,\u201d the crime thriller written by J. K. Rowling as Robert Galbraith. One could say Rowling was simply going deeper into disguise; Joanne Rowling had somehow gotten the idea that books by women were not as widely read or taken as seriously as books by men \u2014 or that boys shy from reading female authors \u2014 and so had chosen to be known by her gender-neutral initials. According to his \u201cbiography,\u201d Galbraith was a former plainclothes policeman working in the security industry. His novel got some good reviews but sold only modestly until his true identity was disclosed. Then the book became a best seller.         \n\nRowling has described impersonating Galbraith as \u201cliberating.\u201d If that freedom enabled her to write a different sort of novel, I say more power to her. Because I\u2019m the sort of reader who, when I discover a writer I like, will read  \n that person\u2019s work. In which case I don\u2019t care what name is on the cover of my new favorite writer\u2019s book.         \n\n \n         \n\n\u25c6 \u25c6 \u25c6         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \nDaniel Mendelsohn \n\nThe joke, apparently, was on us: on you the reader, on us the critics.
