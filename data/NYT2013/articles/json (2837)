{"headline": "Colorado Is Asking Taxpayers for $1 Billion to Help Schools", "body": "\nDENVER \u2014 In one poor school district in Colorado\u2019s San Luis Valley, students take classes in a bus garage, using plastic sheeting to keep the diesel fumes at bay. In another, there is no more money to tutor young immigrants struggling to read. And just south of Denver, a district where one in four kindergartners is homeless has cut 10 staff positions and is bracing for another cull.         \n\nFor decades, schools like these have struggled to keep pace with their bigger and wealthier neighbors. On Tuesday, Colorado will try to address those problems with one of the most ambitious and sweeping education overhauls in the country, asking voters to approve a $1 billion tax increase in exchange for more school funding and an educator\u2019s wish-list of measures.         \n\nThe effort has touched off a fevered debate in a state that two decades ago passed one of the nation\u2019s strictest limits on taxes and spending. It is emerging as the latest test of whether Democrats can persuade voters to embrace higher taxes by tying them to school funding.         \n\nOutside money is pouring into the state. Mayor  \n of New York, who spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to support gun control here, has given $1 million to the school campaign, as have  \n, whose foundation is one of the largest philanthropic organizations involved in public education. Teachers\u2019 unions have contributed at least $4 million, and other pro-labor groups have given thousands.         \n\nThe referendum will ask voters to replace the current flat state income tax rate of 4.6 percent with a two-tier system. Residents with taxable incomes below $75,000 would pay 5 percent; taxable incomes above $75,000 would be taxed at 5.9 percent. \u201c \n,\u201d declare commercials supporting the measure, known as  \n.         \n\nThe amendment would also require the state to direct 43 percent of its budget to schools, ending the current system of tying increases to the rate of inflation.         \n\nSupporters say the measure would provide enough money to revolutionize education for a generation. Opponents, which include anti-tax groups and Republican politicians, say it would raise taxes on struggling families and businesses with no guarantee of a better education.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very hard sell,\u201d conceded Gov. John W. Hickenlooper, a Democrat and the measure\u2019s highest-profile advocate.         \n\nIn 2010, Colorado spent about $9,306 per student, among the bottom 10 states in the country, according to data compiled by Education Week. Over all, the publication ranked the state\u2019s education system slightly behind the national average.         \n\nAmendment 66 would make full-day kindergarten standard across the state. It would set aside more money for students who do not speak English, have learning disabilities or come from poor families. It would send more money toward  \n, as well as districts in poorer areas that cannot easily raise property taxes to buy computers or raise teacher salaries. The measure would also let people go online to track how schools spend every dollar.         \n\n\u201cTotal transparency, school by school,\u201d Mr. Hickenlooper said. \u201cNo state\u2019s ever done that.\u201d         \n\nThe prospect of more money for all has united two usually warring factions, teachers\u2019 unions and the charter school movement. But most business groups have either stayed on the sidelines or expressed worry about the effects of a tax increase on small businesses and job creation. Most Republicans have lined up in opposition, eager to beat back a big tax increase and deal Mr. Hickenlooper, who is up for re-election next year, an embarrassing political defeat.         \n\nThe opposition is being vastly outspent. The main group opposing the measure, Coloradans for Real Education Reform, has raised $24,400, according to state campaign finance figures. Much of that comes from the Independence Institute, a libertarian research group based in Denver.         \n\nSome opponents in richer school districts also object to new funding formulas that would pump more money into poorer schools and those with more students at risk of dropping out. They say the measure\u2019s attempt to even out imbalances between wealthy and struggling schools would just create new disparities.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bad deal,\u201d said Doug Benevento, a school board member in conservative Douglas County and the father of a third-grader and a kindergartner. \u201cOne hundred million dollars would leave our county. Roughly $50 million of that would return.\u201d         \n\nIn California last year, the Democratic governor, Jerry Brown, won passage of a referendum temporarily raising taxes for the first time since 2004 by framing the $6 billion tax increase as a way to save California\u2019s underfinanced public schools. But here, the effort might hinge on which Colorado shows up to vote on Tuesday. Will it be the Colorado that \n, embraced expanded background checks for gun sales and twice supported Barack Obama for president? Or the Colorado that, in September,  \nfor embracing new gun control laws?         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s winnable, but it\u2019s going to be tight,\u201d said Mike Johnston, a Democratic state senator from northeast Denver and an architect of the education measure. \u201cThere are a lot of question marks on this one.\u201d         \n\nAmong them are new election rules that allow voters to register as late as Election Day.         \n\nAs the election approaches, supporters have begun a $10 million push to mobilize voters who might otherwise tune out during an off-year campaign.         \n\nThe two sides are debating each other on radio stations and at community centers. Volunteers are knocking on doors and handing out leaflets. The state\u2019s newspapers have taken sides. The airwaves are filled with commercials offering promises that an average tax increase of $133 per household would fund more teachers\u2019 assistants, art and gym classes and expanded early childhood education, which have been gutted by budget cuts since the recession.         \n\nOpponents said they were worried that school districts could use the money not to pay teachers or decrease class sizes but to meet their soaring pension costs.         \n\nBut George Welsh, the superintendent of Center School District in southern Colorado, says the money could forestall more hard choices. Cuts have whittled budgets bare, he said, forcing the district to pare vocational programs in the high school and raise fourth- and fifth-grade class sizes to 30 students. Elementary art is long gone, and after a federal grant was exhausted, the district can no longer offer reading tutoring to all of the students who need it.         \n\nIf the funding measure passes, the district stands to receive an additional $2,413 for each student, an increase of 32 percent over the current level of $7,523. If it fails, Mr. Welsh said, the district may have to cut more.         \n\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t have the money,\u201d he said.
