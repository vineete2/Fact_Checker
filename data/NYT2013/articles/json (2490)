{"headline": "Istanbul Skyline Reflects Cheap Dollars Now Growing Scarce", "body": "\nIn a city where skyscrapers sprout like weeds, none grew as high as the Sapphire tower in Istanbul.         \n\nToday, it stands as a symbol of how far the mighty may fall.         \n\nLike a vast majority of new buildings that have blanketed the Istanbul hills in recent years, the Sapphire \u2014 at 856 feet it is the tallest in Turkey and among the loftiest in Europe \u2014 was built on the back of cheap loans, in dollars, that have flooded Turkey and other fast-growing markets like Brazil, India and South Korea. The money began to flow when the Federal Reserve and other major central banks cut interest rates to the bone in 2009 and cranked up the printing presses in a bid to spur recovery in the United States and other advanced industrial nations.         \n\nBut now, with expectations mounting that the Federal Reserve, led by its departing chairman Ben S. Bernanke, may soon begin to tighten its monetary spigot, Istanbul\u2019s skyline could well be a harbinger of an emerging-market bust brought on by unpaid loans, weakening currencies, and, eventually, the possible failure of developers and banks.         \n\nThis week, stocks and currencies in several developing Asian markets, including India, Indonesia and Thailand, have been hit hard. Global investors continued to withdraw funds from emerging markets, as interest rates edge up in anticipation of the Fed\u2019s move to reduce its stimulus efforts in the United States. Indonesia\u2019s benchmark index, which fell 5 percent on Monday, dropped 3.2 percent more on Tuesday. India\u2019s stock market fell 0.3 percent after sliding 5.6 percent in the previous two trading sessions.         \n\nSome analysts see it as the markets reacting to an end \u2014 real or perceived \u2014 of the Bernanke boom. \u201cWhat we are witnessing is a huge bubble, a Bernanke bubble if you will,\u201d said Tim Lee of Pi Economics, an independent consultancy based in Greenwich, Conn.         \n\nNot everybody is as alarmed as Mr. Lee. Still, 16 years after emerging markets in Asia imploded after local currencies collapsed, even optimists are starting to grow nervous over the rapid accumulation of dollar-denominated debt not just in Turkey but in other now-struggling economies like Brazil, India and South Korea.         \n\nAs it turned out, some of the biggest beneficiaries of the Fed\u2019s largess were not so much in the developed world, but among the politically connected elite in emerging nations like Turkey, where vanity towers, glitzy shopping malls and even grander projects to come \u2014 a third bridge across the Bosporus and a vast new airport \u2014 have become representative of the nation\u2019s new dynamism, economic as well as geopolitical.         \n\nWhat these elites have so far ignored, Mr. Lee warns, is that their obligations carry with them a significant and pressing danger: currency risk.         \n\nUnlike the risky loans made to subprime borrowers in the United States or Irish real estate developers in the euro zone, dollar debts taken on by companies erecting skyscrapers in Istanbul, manufacturing steel in India and prospecting for oil in Brazil, need to be largely paid back in dollars by entities that earn most of their revenues in their home currency.         \n\nWhen the Turkish lira or the rupee in India was strong \u2014 as these currencies were until recently \u2014 local companies had every incentive to borrow in dollars at comparatively lower interest rates.         \n\nBut when local currencies start to weaken, in line with diminished economic prospects, then the effect is twofold: paying off dollar loans becomes more costly for the borrower, and the lender becomes increasingly skittish about his exposure to a fragile currency and may move to reduce or even slash credit lines.         \n\nWhile Brazil has the largest amount of dollar loans outstanding at $287 billion, few countries have relied on this source of money as much as Turkey, where dollar loans of around $172 billion represent 22 percent of the overall economy.         \n\nIn recent months, the Turkish lira has lost 4.5 percent of its value against the dollar. Adding to this, protests have hit Istanbul\u2019s main public square over an unpopular building sponsored by a developer with close political and cultural ties to the prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
