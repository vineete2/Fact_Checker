{"headline": "In Immigration Bill, Deportees See Hope for Second Chance in U.S.", "body": "\nTIJUANA, Mexico \u2014 Erik Garc\u00eda arrived at the metal gate of a migrant shelter here, deported from Los Angeles just hours earlier. After 23 years in the United States illegally, he suddenly found himself separated from the country where he had moved as a boy, and from his two teenage daughters, both American citizens.         \n\nThat same day, senators in Washington unveiled a surprise: an  \n that could allow deportees like him to return to the United States, a stunning reversal of American policy after years of record-high deportations.         \n\n\u201cReally?\u201d said Mr. Garc\u00eda, 33, wiping his eyes when told of the measure. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d         \n\nNo previous Congressional effort to change immigration law has offered such a broad, swift reprieve to people deported by the government. The bill, introduced last month, would give a legal second chance to tens of thousands of deportees without serious criminal records who have a child, parent or spouse with a green card or American citizenship. Many deportees brought to the United States before their 16th birthday would be eligible to return as well.         \n\nEven in a bill overflowing with ambitious and controversial proposals, the deportee measure is becoming one of the most contested elements \u2014 a humanitarian necessity to some; to others, a shameful reward for lawbreakers.         \n\nOn Wednesday,  \n from Senator Jeff Sessions, the Alabama Republican who is among the bill\u2019s most vocal critics, sought to strip out the deportee reprieve. Other opponents have welcomed it as a political godsend, calling it such an overreach that it would make the entire immigration bill easier to defeat. But some Democrats and immigrant rights groups have pledged to defend the deportee return, characterizing it as an important step in righting a wrong.         \n\n\u201cWe have had four million people deported since 2002 and close to two million since 2008,\u201d said Angelica Salas, director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles. \u201cThis is the only way to reunite families that have been destroyed by our outdated, broken and cruel immigration policies.\u201d         \n\nThe Senate bill, one of the most sweeping bipartisan immigration efforts in decades, would cut down on future deportations by giving millions of immigrants in the United States provisional legal status. It could also reduce illegal traffic heading north because, as Democrats involved in drafting the legislation noted, many migrants crossing the border illegally are deportees trying to return to their families.         \n\nBut it is unclear who would get that winning ticket. Under the legislation, there are obvious candidates who would qualify, some criminals who clearly would not \u2014 and an ocean of people who may fall somewhere in between.         \n\nAn epic sorting process, if the bill passed, would be especially visible here.         \n\nRoughly 70 percent of immigrants deported under President Obama have been sent to Mexico, and Tijuana has received more than anywhere else. More than 461,000 immigrants have been dropped off in this hilly metropolis south of San Diego since 2008, flooding barrios and soup kitchens and adding to insecurity as deportees both commit and fall victim to crime.         \n\n\u201cThe city doesn\u2019t have the resources to care for them,\u201d said Tijuana\u2019s mayor, Carlos Bustamante. \u201cWe\u2019re suffering.\u201d         \n\nHomes and flophouses here are now filled with former and future immigrants like Mar\u00eda Luisa Reyes, who left her tiny town in central Mexico in 1989, at 20. Now she has three daughters in the United States whom she has been trying to get back to since being deported two years ago.         \n\n\u201cI was in the immigration office checking on my application to get legal, and they told me I was denied and that I needed to be removed,\u201d she said. \u201cThey arrested me right there.\u201d         \n\n\u201cMy youngest daughter is 7,\u201d she added, in limbo at a women\u2019s shelter here. \u201cWhen I call, she says, \u2018Why, Mommy, why?\u2019\u201d         \n\nMr. Garc\u00eda, 33, also tried to get legal. He said he arrived in the United States when he was 10 and tried to adjust his status in 2007, while working for one of California\u2019s largest catering companies. But he lost his job in a mass layoff in 2010, he said, and moved in with his sister. When immigration officials sent him a letter with an appointment date, he said, he never saw it. An order of removal followed, unbeknown to Mr. Garc\u00eda until last month.
