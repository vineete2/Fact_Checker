{"headline": "A Flood of Suits Fights Coverage of Birth Control", "body": "\nIn a flood of lawsuits, Roman Catholics, evangelicals and Mennonites are challenging a provision in the  \n that requires employers to cover  \n in employee health plans \u2014 a high-stakes clash between religious freedom and health care access that appears headed to the  \n.         \n\nIn recent months, federal courts have seen dozens of  \n brought not only by religious institutions like Catholic dioceses but also by private employers ranging from a pizza mogul to produce transporters who say the government is forcing them to violate core tenets of their faith. Some have been turned away by judges convinced that access to  \n is a vital health need and a compelling state interest. Others have been told that their beliefs appear to outweigh any state interest and that they may hold off complying with the law until their cases have been judged.  \n are filed nearly weekly.         \n\n\u201cThis is highly likely to end up at the Supreme Court,\u201d said Douglas Laycock, a law professor at the University of Virginia and one of the country\u2019s top scholars on church-state conflicts. \u201cThere are so many cases, and we are already getting strong disagreements among the circuit courts.\u201d         \n\nPresident Obama\u2019s health care law, known as the Affordable Care Act, was the most fought-over piece of legislation in his first term and was the focus of a highly contentious  \n last year that found it to be constitutional.         \n\nBut a provision requiring the full coverage of contraception remains a matter of fierce controversy. The law says that companies must fully cover all \u201ccontraceptive methods and sterilization procedures\u201d approved by the Food and Drug Administration, including \u201cmorning-after pills\u201d and intrauterine devices whose effects some contend are akin to  \n.         \n\nAs applied by the Health and Human Services Department, the law offers an exemption for \u201creligious employers,\u201d meaning those who meet a four-part test: that their purpose is to inculcate religious values, that they primarily employ and serve people who share their religious tenets, and that they are nonprofit groups under federal tax law.         \n\nBut many institutions, including religious schools and colleges, do not meet those criteria because they employ and teach members of other religions and have a broader purpose than inculcating religious values.         \n\n\u201cWe represent a Catholic college founded by Benedictine monks,\u201d said Kyle Duncan, general counsel of the  \n, which has brought a number of the cases to court. \u201cThey don\u2019t qualify as a house of worship and don\u2019t turn away people in hiring or as students because they are not Catholic.\u201d         \n\nIn that case, involving Belmont Abbey College in North Carolina, a federal appeals court panel in Washington told the college last month that it  \n while the federal government works on a promised exemption for religiously-affiliated institutions. The court told the government that it wanted an update by mid-February.         \n\nDefenders of the provision say employers may not be permitted to impose their views on employees, especially when something so central as health care is concerned.         \n\n\u201cNinety-nine percent of women use contraceptives at some time in their lives,\u201d said Judy Waxman, a vice president of the  \n, which filed a brief supporting the government in one of the cases. \u201cThere is a strong and legitimate government interest because it affects the health of women and babies.\u201d         \n\nShe added, referring to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \u201cContraception was declared by the C.D.C. to be one of the 10 greatest public health achievements of the 20th century.\u201d         \n\nOfficials at the Justice Department and the Health and Human Services Department declined to comment, saying the cases were pending.         \n\nA compromise for religious institutions may be worked out. The government hopes that by placing the burden on insurance companies rather than on the organizations, the objections will be overcome. Even more challenging cases involve private companies run by people who reject all or many forms of contraception.         \n\nThe  \n \u2014 like Becket, a conservative group \u2014 has brought a case on behalf of Hercules Industries, a company in Denver that makes sheet metal products. It was granted an injunction by a judge in Colorado who said the  \n.         \n\n\u201cTwo-thirds of the cases have had injunctions against Obamacare, and most are headed to courts of appeals,\u201d said Matt Bowman, senior legal counsel for the alliance. \u201cIt is clear that a substantial number of these cases will vindicate religious freedom over Obamacare. But it seems likely that the Supreme Court will ultimately resolve the dispute.\u201d         \n\nThe timing of these cases remains in flux. Half a dozen will probably be argued by this summer, perhaps in time for inclusion on the Supreme Court\u2019s docket next term. So far, two- and three-judge panels on four federal appeals courts have weighed in, granting some injunctions while denying others.         \n\nOne of the biggest cases involves Hobby Lobby, which started as a picture framing shop in an Oklahoma City garage with $600 and is now one of the country\u2019s largest arts and crafts retailers, with more than 500 stores in 41 states.         \n\nDavid Green, the company\u2019s founder, is an evangelical Christian who says he runs his company on biblical principles, including closing on Sunday so employees can be with their families, paying nearly double the minimum wage and providing employees with comprehensive  \n.         \n\nMr. Green does not object to covering contraception but considers morning-after pills to be abortion-inducing and therefore wrong.         \n\n\u201cOur family is now being forced to choose between following the laws of the land that we love or maintaining the religious beliefs that have made our business successful and have supported our family and thousands of our employees and their families,\u201d Mr. Green said in a statement. \u201cWe simply cannot abandon our religious beliefs to comply with this mandate.\u201d         \n\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit last month turned down his family\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction, but the company has found a legal way to delay compliance for some months.
