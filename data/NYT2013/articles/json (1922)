{"headline": "Stumbling Blocks in Reducing Balance on a Student Loan", "body": "\nYOU\u2019VE been working hard and paying your student loans on time, and you find yourself with a bit of extra cash. So you decide that instead of spending it, you\u2019ll make an extra loan payment, to whittle down your principal faster and save money on interest.         \n\nBut when you receive your next statement, your loan servicer appears to have merely credited you with an early payment for next month, rather than applying the money to your principal.         \n\nDifficulties in having payments properly applied to a loan balance are among the most common complaints the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau receives about student loans, according to the bureau\u2019s second annual report on the topic.         \n\n \nreleased on Wednesday, summarizes roughly 3,800 complaints received from Oct. 1, 2012, to Sept. 30.         \n\nThe bureau oversees student loans from private lenders, like banks; loans made or guaranteed by the federal government are handled by the Education Department. The bureau estimates that private student loans now total $165 billion and that about 850,000 private loans were in default as of July 2012. (In comparison, it estimated this summer that federal student loans exceeded $1 trillion.) But a majority of high-debt borrowers have private loans, according to the bureau. Private loans generally have higher interest rates and lack some consumer protections available with federal loans.         \n\nRohit Chopra, the bureau\u2019s student loan ombudsman, cautioned that the report was not based on a representative sample of borrowers. But the report notes that complaints to the bureau can help show where there is \u201ca mismatch between borrower expectations and actual service delivered,\u201d and that there was a \u201csignificant trend\u201d in complaints about confusing or inaccurate payment processing.         \n\nFurthermore, while the report focuses on private loans, many of the companies that service those loans, like Sallie Mae, also service federal loans, he said.         \n\nA spokeswoman for Sallie Mae, Patricia Christel, said that more than 90 percent of the company\u2019s private education loan customers were managing their payments successfully, \u201cand for those experiencing difficulty, we offer customized assistance, including modifications.\u201d         \n\nMany borrowers face \u201cstumbling blocks, snags and surprises\u201d when it comes to payment processing practices, Mr. Chopra said in a telephone call with reporters.         \n\nOne problem, he said, is that few options for refinancing private student loans allow students to take advantage of lower interest rates and reduce their monthly payments. Students who are financially able to reduce their debt may choose instead to make extra payments, to help pay down their principal faster.         \n\nBorrowers sending in extra payments, however, may find that the money is not allocated in the way they intended. Sometimes, borrowers told the bureau, they received a notice putting them into \u201cpaid ahead\u201d or \u201cadvanced payment\u201d status.         \n\nComplicating the problem is the fact that borrowers typically have several loans, with different balances and interest rates, which are bundled together in one \u201cbilling group\u201d with a servicer, who collects a single payment and applies it to the individual loans. Just how much benefit a borrower gets from the extra payment depends on how the servicer applies the money. Savings will generally be greater, for instance, if the entire extra payment is applied to the loan with the highest interest rate, rather than being prorated to each loan individually.         \n\nHere are some questions to consider when making extra payments to reduce your student loan balance:         \n\n\u25a0 \n         \n\nNo. Private lenders are barred from penalizing students who make extra payments or pay off their loans early. (Federal loans do not have prepayment penalties either, Mr. Chopra said,)         \n\n\u25a0 \n         \n\nSend written instructions to your servicer; otherwise, the servicer may choose how to allocate the extra money. The bureau created a sample  \n, directing the servicer to apply extra payments to the loan with the highest interest rate first, which is generally the best option for most borrowers.         \n\nPauline Abernathy, vice president of the nonprofit Institute for College Access and Success, said the report suggested there should be a uniform policy, outlining the way payments were applied. \u201cWhy force the borrower to specify?\u201d she said.         \n\n\u25a0  \n         \n\nYou can file a complaint with the bureau at consumerfinance.gov/complaint/        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/17/your-money/stumbling-blocks-in-reducing-balance-on-a-student-loan.html", "date": "2013-10-16", "description": "Difficulties in having payments properly applied to a student loan balance is a common complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau."}
