{"headline": "Amid Hunger Strike, Obama Renews Push to Close Cuba Prison", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama said on Tuesday that he would recommit himself to closing the Guant\u00e1namo Bay prison, a goal that he all but abandoned in the face of Congressional opposition in his first term and that faces steep challenges now.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not sustainable,\u201d Mr. Obama said at a White House news conference. \u201cThe notion that we\u2019re going to keep 100 individuals in no man\u2019s land in perpetuity,\u201d he added, makes no sense. \u201cAll of us should reflect on why exactly are we doing this? Why are we doing this?\u201d         \n\nDescribing the prison in Cuba as a waste of taxpayer money that has had a damaging effect on American foreign policy, Mr. Obama said he would try again to persuade Congress to lift restrictions on transferring inmates. He also said he had ordered a review of \u201ceverything that we can do administratively.\u201d         \n\nBut there is no indication that Mr. Obama\u2019s proposal to close the prison, as he vowed to do upon taking office in 2009 after criticizing it during the presidential campaign, has become any more popular. Mr. Obama remarked that \u201cit\u2019s a hard case to make\u201d because \u201cit\u2019s easy to demagogue the issue.\u201d         \n\nThe plan for Guant\u00e1namo he proposed \u2014 moving any remaining prisoners to a  \n \u2014 was blocked by Congress, which barred any further transfers of detainees onto domestic soil. A spokesman for Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader and one of the leading opponents of closing the prison, said on Tuesday that \u201cthere is wide, bipartisan opposition in Congress to the president\u2019s goal of moving those terrorists to American cities and towns.\u201d         \n\nMr. Obama made his remarks following the arrival at the prison of more than three dozen Navy nurses, corpsmen and specialists to help deal with a mass  \n by inmates, many of whom have been held for over 11 years without trial. As of Tuesday, 100 of the 166 prisoners were officially deemed to be participating, with 21 now being force-fed a nutritional supplement through tubes inserted in their noses.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want these individuals to die,\u201d Mr. Obama said.         \n\nBoth conservatives and civil libertarians said that under existing law, Mr. Obama could be doing more to reduce the number of low-level detainees held at the prison.         \n\nThe chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Representative Howard P. McKeon, Republican of California, noted that the Obama administration had never exercised the power it has had since 2012 to waive, on a case-by-case basis, most of the restrictions lawmakers have imposed on transferring detainees to countries with troubled security conditions.         \n\n\u201cFor the past two years, our committee has worked with our Senate counterparts to ensure that the certifications necessary to transfer detainees overseas are reasonable,\u201d Mr. McKeon said. \u201cThe administration has never certified a single transfer.\u201d         \n\nHuman rights groups also urged Mr. Obama to direct the Pentagon to start issuing waivers, and said he should appoint a White House official to run Guant\u00e1namo policy with the authority to resolve interagency disputes. For example, because of disagreements over evidence tainted by torture, the administration has missed by more than a year a deadline to begin parole-style hearings by so-called Periodic Review Boards.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more to be done, but these are the two essential first steps the president can take now to break the Guant\u00e1namo logjam,\u201d said Anthony D. Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union.         \n\nAnother group, the Center for Constitutional Rights, which represents detainees,  \n to lift his self-imposed ban on repatriations to Yemen, where a branch of Al Qaeda is active. Of the 86 low-level detainees who were designated in January 2010 for potential transfer but remain incarcerated, 56 are Yemenis.         \n\nAsked for greater details about Mr. Obama\u2019s intentions, a National Security Council spokeswoman, Caitlin Hayden, said the president was \u201cconsidering a range of options for ways that we can reduce the population there,\u201d including \u201creappointing a senior official at the State Department to renew our focus on repatriating or transferring\u201d lower-risk detainees. The administration reassigned the previous diplomat charged with that task in January and has not replaced him.         \n\n\u201cWe will also work to fully implement the Periodic Review Board process, which we acknowledge has not moved forward quickly enough,\u201d she added.
