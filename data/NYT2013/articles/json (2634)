{"headline": "Reporter Returns to Texas Capitol, Where Father\u2019s Voice Still Rings", "body": "\nA little while ago, my bosses asked me to fill in for a colleague by reporting from Austin, Tex., where the State Legislature was considering one of the  \n in the country. I was happy to say yes. Not only was it a fascinating topic, but Austin is also one of my favorite towns. Not coincidentally, my parents and my daughter and son-in-law live there.         \n\nSo it was good to be back in the Lone Star State. But what surprised me was how eerie it felt to be walking the halls of the Capitol again: I grew up in the building. My father, \n, known as Babe, was a member of the Legislature between 1955, two years before I was born, until 1980, when I was in college and he was swept out of office with the Reagan tide. The photos of Dad on the \u201cmember panels\u201d that line the Capitol walls show him at 29 and aging with every two-year session photo, like a time-lapse walk down the hallway. There are pictures of me and my brothers, too, as \u201cmascots\u201d of the Legislature on those same panels: a photo of me as a newborn in his 1957 House panel, and another in his first Senate panel in 1961.         \n\nI was even part of Dad\u2019s political campaigns. There is an old ad showing me, at age 7, sitting in Dad\u2019s Senate chair, with a little story recalling the moment that I had told Dad I liked the big leather swivel chair and asked him to buy one for me. At the time, he explained that it was state property. But when a wealthy Galvestonian, Maco Stewart III, challenged Dad for his Senate seat, the ad included an invented, but more politically effective, response: \u201cThis seat is not for sale. It must be earned.\u201d         \n\nBeing in the Capitol wasn\u2019t that strange, since I visit the building on nearly every trip to Austin, showing my children those member panel pictures so many times that they are sick of the nostalgic walks. No, it was  \n there that caused my peculiar d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu: The last time I had earned a paycheck under the dome was the summer of 1968. I was 11 years old. My job: legislative page in the State House of Representatives.         \n\nAt the time, nepotism rules allowed us to work in the chamber our parents didn\u2019t serve in, and Dad was in the Senate by then; child labor laws, apparently, did not apply. I would be called over to a House member\u2019s desk in those days before texting and be handed a note, with quick instructions: \u201cTake this to  \n.\u201d I would run across the building to the Senate, where Ms. Jordan sat, along with Dad and others like Charlie Wilson, who would later be immortalized in George Crile\u2019s book,  \n I see him always from those days, wearing a leisure suit in a shade of green so bright that my eyes ached just looking at him.         \n\nThe sergeants-at-arms instructed us never to take the elevators, possibly slowing the progress of a member of the Legislature on the way to a vote, but to scamper up and down the stairs of the Capitol, taking the steps in a rapid cascade of footfalls that almost felt like dancing. There were a lot of stairs; we pages slept well at night.         \n\nLater, the old nepotism rule would be questioned. My brothers and I gave the money we\u2019d earned back, writing checks from our junior bank accounts. I was O.K. with it: an early lesson in politics that what is promised and given can be taken away. My little brother Tommy was furious, though, and wrote a letter to go with his check to the secretary of the Senate. It said something like: \u201cI hope you remember this letter. Because I will.\u201d         \n\nSo there I was, back in a building that has never seemed anything but majestic to me. But there were differences. Sure, to some extent I am still Babe\u2019s boy \u2014 it was a helpful part of every introduction to a member of the Legislature or staffer. But I was coming back to town in a role of my own, as someone who had made his own career in his own trade, journalism. Dad\u2019s career had been about working from the inside to get things done, and being a loud and forceful advocate for his side. Watching Dad on the Senate floor was like watching a master of the arts of legislation and stagecraft; I got the feeling that if I followed in his footsteps I\u2019d suffer in comparison. Instead, I chose to be more of an outsider, trying to make a difference by informing readers, but not giving a strong push to any one side. Besides, as a kid I\u2019d watched reporters interview Dad, and even sneaked into the press room to visit with them. The lawmakers were running the show, but the folks who covered them seemed to be having a better time.         \n\nMy decision to type for a living didn\u2019t initially sit well with Dad. He didn\u2019t understand, in those early days, why I would give up not just the potential income of a lawyer but the challenge of that career, or even of being a politician. He said he loved what he did, telling me, \u201cI learn something new every day.\u201d It wasn\u2019t that he disliked journalists, but he didn\u2019t know many who could support a family comfortably. During the less-than-stellar freelancing stage of my career, he gave me a book he had found: \n Oh, how he laughed.         \n\nNow we both understand that learning something new every day is something I wanted, too \u2014 and found a career that helped me do that. Mom and Dad are proud of what I do, and where I\u2019ve gotten.         \n\nSo there I was, back in the Capitol and hanging out with the working press again. I am older today than Dad was when he left the Senate in 1980; Babe Schwartz is still around, though, working the sessions at the age of 87 as a lobbyist. I could make fun of him for going through the revolving door, but I could never come up with anything better than the line he started using after he had brain surgery some years back: \u201cMy doctor said I didn\u2019t have enough of my brain to practice law \u2014 but it was all right to lobby.\u201d         \n\nMy week with the Legislature ended in the Senate chamber with a long evening session of speeches, noisy demonstrations, acrimony and a midnight vote. The boy I had been and the middle-aged man I am shared a tired moment of wonder at the way life can bring us full circle, but on a different path.         \n\nWhen I left the Senate chamber and headed out of the building, I ran down the stairs.
