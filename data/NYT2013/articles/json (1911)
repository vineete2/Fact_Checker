That\u2019s his \u201cRepublican ideology\u201d kicking in, Mr. de Blasio said.         \n\nI\u2019m pro-choice, I\u2019m pro-gay rights, I\u2019m pro-marriage-equality, Mr. Lhota protested. \u201cDo not lump me with the national Republicans. It\u2019s unbecoming, Bill.\u201d         \n\nTrue. But it\u2019s also true that Mr. Lhota is no faux Republican, like Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who donned whatever party coat he could acquire at election time, and damn the sticker price. Mr. Lhota is authentically Republican, though not of the  \n variety.         \n\nIn a debate in which the two candidates agreed more than you might guess, Mr. Lhota\u2019s challenge \u2014 make that headache \u2014 was clear. Long ago he enrolled as a knight in Rudy Giuliani\u2019s mayoral crusades, and it remains his defining characteristic.         \n\nMr. Giuliani was a wartime, smile when he\u2019s more naturally inclined to sneer, mayor. That city was one of rough edges and cantankerous hooting. From Bensonhurst to Brownsville, the sense sometimes was of a city as a ball of thread unspooling.         \n\nNow? Young people from Montclair, N.J., and Shaker Heights, Ohio pour in looking for cheap apartments on Troutman Street in Bushwick, Brooklyn, where in 1992 \u2014 to firmly date myself \u2014 I spent a month in a heroin shooting gallery. (For a story, not out of personal need).         \n\nThat city is long since pasteurized; the pain now is economic. Those young people live four to an apartment next door to working class Latino families. And they all spend more than half their income on rent.         \n\nOur city feels profoundly O.K. and profoundly broken. And Mr. de Blasio long ago made this dissonance a theme in his mayoral sprint. Can he make its economics less unyielding? Or as a reporter put it to him last night: Can a man who runs an office with a budget of $2 million manage a city with a budget of $70 billion?         \n\nHe insists he can. But his claims can prompt tickles of doubt. So in his eagerness to tar Republicans as the cause of the city\u2019s discontents, he accused Mayor Bloomberg of producing mostly luxury condominiums.         \n\nMr. Bloomberg in fact ran a remarkably progressive housing program that produced more than 155,000 units of affordable housing. A Mayor de Blasio will most likely turn to these same housing officials to realize his own vision.         \n\nThe Democrat also draped a fare increase necklace around Mr. Lhota\u2019s neck. (Mr. Lhota ran the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees all the subways and buses). The claim was true, but incomplete, as the State Legislature\u2019s urban Democrats are just as guilty of refusing to finance the city\u2019s transit system as rural Republicans.         \n\nWatching Mr. Lhota on Tuesday night, you got a sense of a man trying to dance to an unfamiliar tune. He proudly claimed that mantle of Rudy the Micromanager. I will be the strong chief executive, and commissioners will jump to my command.         \n\nBut he ignores that Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s style, which was to give his commissioners much latitude, produced successes from transportation to streetscape to housing, the environment and health. Again, a non-wartime mayoralty is a different beast.         \n\nCan I digress, too? This substantive debate spoke well of each candidate. But then reporters asked the men to make a clean breast of their sports loyalties.         \n\nAnd so I learned that Mr. de Blasio, the man who would be mayor of New York, is a fan of the deeply hated Celtics basketball team. Had he laid claim to the arriviste Nets, it would have been pathetic but acceptable.         \n\nBut to acknowledge he\u2019s a Celticsnista? The horror.         \n\nMr. Lhota tossed down his strongest card toward the debate\u2019s end. You want a city, he asked, where New Yorkers, gay, straight, black and brown can feel safe, have fun, and raise families? He\u2019s that manager.         \n\nThis is Mr. de Blasio\u2019s challenge, too. A New York mayor can be as progressive as he wants, but he better make sure the garbage is picked up, the streets are plowed, and that the subways run. And that the unions don\u2019t strike.         \n\nSo the thought arose: Joseph J. Lhota for first deputy mayor in a de Blasio administration?
