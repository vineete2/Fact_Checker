{"headline": "14 Screenwriters Writing", "body": "\nScreenwriters famously get no respect. It probably doesn\u2019t help that one of the most famous quotes about the trade boils down to money, competition and idiots. Herman J. Mankiewicz, in an often-cited telegram sent from Hollywood to his fellow writer Ben Hecht, promised: \u201cMillions are to be grabbed out here, and your only competition is idiots. Don\u2019t let this get around.\u201d         \n\nSo in the starry constellation of literary pursuits, screenwriters have always existed, reputationally if not financially, somewhere due south of novelists and maybe southeast of poets and playwrights. With their riches and big-screen credits, people who wrote for the movies used to be able to at least lord over lowly TV writers, but even that dynamic has reversed in recent years. TV writers are now routinely lauded as auteurs. Screenwriters are still screenwriters, i.e., the people who write the scripts that the directors and actors will eventually rewrite, mangle or ignore.         \n\nBut, oh, what scripts: 2013 was an excellent year for the written word as spoken on-screen. \u201cBefore Midnight,\u201d written by its stars (Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy) and its director (Richard Linklater), is basically the third installment in a captivating conversation that has been going on for 18 years. At the other end of the loquaciousness spectrum, there\u2019s \u201cAll Is Lost,\u201d written by J. C. Chandor, a screenplay that includes fewer lines of dialogue than there are sentences in this introduction. Sarah Polley brought her storytelling powers to bear on a quasi documentary, \u201cStories We Tell,\u201d while Nicole Holofcener, with \u201cEnough Said,\u201d continued her streak as the patron saint of literate neurotics (both on-screen and off). Greta Gerwig (along with the director Noah Baumbach) wrote lines, then gave them voice, as the title character in \u201cFrances Ha.\u201d Andrew Bujalski somehow made a computer chess tournament exciting. Spike Jonze wrote a classic love story, a tale of boy meets operating system.         \n\nIt\u2019s notable that many of these writers \u2014 most, in fact \u2014 also directed their own scripts (Bell, Bujalski, Chandor, Holofcener, Jonze, Linklater, Polley), and several also star in the films they wrote (Bell, Delpy, Gerwig, Hawke, Seth Rogen). Here, though, we simply want to focus on their work as writers and highlight the written word \u2014 that part of the process that makes the rest of the process possible.         \n\nWe asked each of these writers to provide a single line of original dialogue, which were then used as inspiration for 11 short films. We also asked a few of them to pass on a writing tip or two, which you can find below. (Aspiring screenwriters, take note: There are still millions to be made in Hollywood, but the competition is much more daunting.) Mostly, though, we want to celebrate the part of a film that starts on the page and ends up, in the best cases, inscribed onto our memories. In other words, the words.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n \u201cFrances Ha\u201d (2013)         \n\n \nI think \u201cAnother Year,\u201d by Mike Leigh, is a great screenplay.         \n\n \nWhenever you have an \u201cidea,\u201d as in a concept that you could explain to someone, like a hook or at worst a gimmick, that is a bad thing. It feels good, but it\u2019s not good. The best ideas reveal themselves, you don\u2019t \u201chave\u201d them. For me, anyway.         \n\nLet your characters talk to each other and do things. Spend time with them \u2014 they\u2019ll tell you who they are and what they\u2019re up to.         \n\nI have gotten into baseball recently, and whenever I have trouble writing, I think about the pace of baseball. It\u2019s slow. You strike out a lot, even if you\u2019re great. It\u2019s mostly individual, but when you have to work together, it must be perfect. My desktop picture is of the Red Sox during the World Series. They aren\u2019t winning; they\u2019re just grinding out another play. This, for me, is very helpful to have in my mind while writing.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n \u201cComputer Chess\u201d (2013); \u201cFunny Ha Ha\u201d (2002); \u201cHannah Takes the Stairs\u201d (2007)        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/01/magazine/14-screenwriters-writing.html", "date": "2013-11-25", "description": "A celebration of the people who wrote the best words we heard on-screen this year."}
