{"headline": "For Medicare, Immigrants Offer Surplus, Study Finds", "body": "\nImmigrants have contributed billions of dollars more to Medicare in recent years than the program has paid out on their behalf, according to a new study, a pattern that goes against the notion that immigrants are a drain on federal health care spending.         \n\nThe  \n, led by researchers at Harvard Medical School, measured immigrants\u2019 contributions to the part of Medicare that pays for hospital care, a trust fund that accounts for nearly half of the federal program\u2019s revenue. It found that immigrants generated surpluses totaling $115 billion from 2002 to 2009. In comparison, the American-born population incurred a deficit of $28 billion over the same period.         \n\nThe findings shed light on what demographers have long known: Immigrants are crucial in balancing the age structure of American society, providing an infusion of young, working-age adults who support the country\u2019s aging population and help cover the costs of Medicare and Social Security. And with the largest generation in the United States, the baby boomers, now starting to retire, the financial help from immigrants has never been more needed, experts said.         \n\nIndividual immigrant contributions were roughly the same as those of American citizens, the study found, but immigrants as a group received less than they paid in, largely because they were younger on average than the American-born population and fewer of them were old enough to be eligible for benefits. The median age of Hispanics, whose foreign-born contingent is by far the largest immigrant group, is 27, according to the Brookings Institution. The median age of non-Hispanic whites in the United States is 42.         \n\nThe study drew on two nationally representative federal surveys, from the Census Bureau and the Department of Health and Human Services. Researchers included the contributions of legal residents who were not citizens, a group that is eligible for Medicare if certain requirements are met; unauthorized immigrants; and citizens who were born abroad.         \n\nIt was not clear how much of the surplus was made up of earnings by immigrants in the country illegally, who are ineligible for most government programs.         \n\nThe Census Bureau, whose data was used for the contributions portion of the study, says it attempts to count all immigrants, including those in the country illegally.         \n\nThe finding \u201cpokes a hole in the widespread assumption that immigrants drain U.S. health care spending dollars,\u201d said Leah Zallman, an instructor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and the lead author of the study.         \n\nThe study, which was published on the Web site of the journal Health Affairs on Wednesday, comes as Congress considers legislation that would eventually give legal status to the country\u2019s 11 million unauthorized immigrants. The legislation has sparked a vigorous debate about whether immigrants ultimately contribute more than they receive from the federal budget. One of the sticking points has been whether immigrants should be eligible for government programs, including health benefits, before they qualify for citizenship, but while they are on the path to getting it.         \n\nThe study was concerned only with Medicare, the federal program that accounts for about a fifth of all American health care expenditures. Experts said that the study\u2019s findings served as a useful reminder that immigrants, at least for now, are extending the life of the beleaguered program, not hastening its demise.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this strong belief that immigrants are takers,\u201d said Leighton Ku, the director of the  \n at George Washington University. \u201cThis shows they are contributing hugely. Without immigrants, the Medicare trust fund would be in trouble sooner.\u201d The belief prevails, for example, among some opponents of immigration reform.         \n\nThe study did not grapple with the health care costs of immigrants over their full lifetimes, a calculation that economists say is critical to understanding their long-term impact on the federal budget.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a snapshot of a point in time,\u201d said Paul Van de Water, a visiting fellow at the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
