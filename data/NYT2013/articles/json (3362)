But in these tough economic times, the mayor here, Borja Guti\u00e9rrez, did not much like that idea. Instead, this town engaged a small army of volunteers to bag it, box it and send it back to its owners.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s your dog, it\u2019s your dog poop,\u201d Mr. Guti\u00e9rrez said. \u201cWe are just returning it to you.\u201d         \n\nUntil now, Brunete\u2019s claim to fame, if it had one, was that it sustained heavy damage in the Spanish Civil War. But these days, this leafy hamlet has made headlines all over Spain. Residents say that strangers take note when they say they live in Brunete.         \n\nAt a recent political event, Mr. Guti\u00e9rrez said, the mayor of Madrid sought him out.         \n\n\u201cShe said, \u2018Well, it is not many mayors who think sending dog poop to voters is a good idea,' \u201d Mr. Guti\u00e9rrez said. \u201c \u2018How did you dare?\u2019 \u201d         \n\nMr. Guti\u00e9rrez shrugged. After nearly two years in office, he said, he had visited with some 220 citizens in their homes, and the subject of dog owners was the one constant complaint. As spring approached this year, when children started going to the parks again, he decided to try what many here are calling \u201cdirect marketing.\u201d         \n\nThe dog owners got their packages \u2014 white boxes bearing the seal of this town and labeled \u201clost and found\u201d \u2014 within hours.         \n\nSigning for the curious parcels, they must have been intrigued, though surely unsuspecting.         \n\nSo far, the boxes seem to be extremely effective compared with Brunete\u2019s earlier campaign, which involved a remote control specimen (very lifelike) that was used around town to get people\u2019s attention. It followed. It banged into shoes. And it generally drew laughs. There was some improvement in behavior. But it did not last long.         \n\nDelivering 147 boxes of the real stuff seems to have produced a far more lasting effect in this town of about 10,000 residents. The mayor guesses a 70 percent improvement even now, several months after the two-week campaign.         \n\nA casual inspection of the town park near City Hall seemed to support his claim. Dog owners without exception were carrying plastic bags, a sight that is still extremely rare across Spain. Most of the owners seemed to find the lost and found campaign funny.         \n\n\u201cI would laugh if it happened to me,\u201d said Anahi Fidalgo, who, bag in hand, was walking his Shih Tzu, Coco. \u201cI would be ashamed. But I would laugh.\u201d         \n\nBut not all dog owners agreed with him.         \n\nThe sting operation worked like this: Volunteers were instructed to watch for negligent dog owners and then to approach their dogs to pet them. After a few flattering remarks about the beauty of said dog, they asked what breed it was. Then they asked the dog\u2019s name.         \n\nBack at City Hall, where more than 500 residents have their pets registered, that was enough information to get to an address.         \n\nNo one has yet publicly admitted to receiving a package. But these days asking a dog\u2019s name in Brunete is likely to earn you a hard look. One woman walking her dog (it looked like a beagle) refused to give either her name or the dog\u2019s.         \n\n\u201cThere is a campaign against dogs in this town, and what has this dog ever done?\u201d she said. The woman said emphatically that she had always picked up after the dog.         \n\nOf course, everybody interviewed insisted the same.         \n\nYet Ignacio Serra, 21, who was the only volunteer willing to talk to a reporter, largely because he does not live here, said it was easy to find owners who turned their backs on their dog\u2019s business. He collected six deposits of poop himself, he said, which he found \u201cpretty disgusting.\u201d         \n\nStill, he said, his first undercover assignment (he popped an imaginary collar for effect) had made him laugh. \u201cI thought it was very funny, and I had nothing else to do that day,\u201d he said.         \n\nNowadays, he said, his friends sometimes refer to him as \u201cthe Poop Hunter.\u201d         \n\nFor two weeks, no one complained, the mayor said. But then he got a few calls. Some people who had been sent the boxes said that City Hall had gone out of its way to humiliate them.         \n\nThe mayor said that pretty much everyone in town knew who had gotten a box. He himself could not resist a peek at the list.         \n\nThe idea for the lost and found campaign was not actually his. It came from the advertising agency McCann Erickson. The mayor said his brother, a professor, had students who were interns at the agency last year and did the remote control poop campaign. This year, the mayor went back to McCann looking for something more \u201caggressive.\u201d         \n\nAt first, Ricardo Rovira, who was part of the design team at the agency, worried that the mayor would not have the courage to go ahead with its direct marketing idea. But he did. McCann also made an amusing  \n, produced by Juan Jos\u00e9 Ocio, largely using actors. It was shown around town before concerts and community meetings.         \n\nAnd, as it turns out, the effort was good for business.         \n\n\u201cWe have gotten some very serious clients because of this campaign,\u201d Mr. Rovira said.         \n\nMr. Guti\u00e9rrez is not really hopeful that the good behavior will last, though. He is working on ideas for next year. But he won\u2019t discuss them.
