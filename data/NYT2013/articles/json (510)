{"headline": "Mom and Dad, Let\u2019s Talk Real Estate", "body": "\nIn this city of 350,000-plus co-op apartments and an aging population, it\u2019s a quintessential New York story. A couple has owned an apartment for decades. Long after the children departed the nest, the parents have stayed, rattling around in quarters too large for their needs. Yet even if the apartment has grown shabbier, its value has soared.         \n\nExcept in the case of the superrich, the apartment is most likely the parents\u2019 major asset, and their children understandably want its future resolved while their parents are still in good shape mentally and physically. They want to avoid unnecessary  \n, capital gains taxes and other financial penalties should the parents die or move to smaller, easier-to-manage quarters.         \n\nThey might want to raise cash to pay for possible medical expenses down the line or to reduce assets so a parent needing health aides or nursing-home care will be eligible for  \n. They might be eyeing the apartment for their own use.         \n\nHow do children nudge often-reluctant parents toward making sound and fiscally smart decisions about the future of the family home? How can assets be protected while keeping a roof over the parents\u2019 head? What are the main issues that need to be kept in mind as planning goes forward? How do children, or in their absence, other close relatives, begin the difficult and sometimes painful conversations needed to resolve these issues? In the case of apartments that have sharply escalated in value, how do you guide parents unused to dealing with large sums of money?         \n\nFrances Katzen, a broker with Douglas Elliman Real Estate, well knows what can happen when families fail to act in a timely manner. Her experience involved a onetime grande dame of the world of fashion journalism who lived alone in a two-bedroom Park Avenue co-op she had owned for decades. At this point in her 80s, never married and without children, the woman was mostly bedridden. Her nephew, her main caregiver, invited Ms. Katzen to join a discussion of the apartment\u2019s future.         \n\n\u201cI witnessed two very long and emotional conversations,\u201d Ms. Katzen said. \u201cWhen the nephew told his aunt that she\u2019d have to sell the apartment, she became terrified and insisted that it be taken off the market. She couldn\u2019t picture moving to a one-bedroom rental, and she began to cry. The nephew wanted to be respectful of her wishes, but the whole effort proved way too stressful.\u201d         \n\nEvery family\u2019s situation is different. But lawyers and other estate planning professionals agree that taking a few basic steps early on can be extremely helpful and can avoid problems in the future. Some of the suggestions may seem self-evident, but as Aaron Shmulewitz, a partner of Belkin Burden Wenig & Goldman who represents co-ops and condominiums, said: \u201cMany older people are deeply reluctant to relinquish control of where they live. If this advice were so obvious, there wouldn\u2019t be so many messy situations.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nOn one point the experts are unanimous: When it comes to determining the future of a home, start early. Don\u2019t procrastinate. Catastrophic medical situations can arise out of the blue. People are struck by cars or severely injured in falls. Even a seemingly healthy person can die unexpectedly.         \n\nThe process should begin while the owners can still think straight, see and hear well, and are relatively mobile. Because a person of sound mind will find it easier and less stressful to make complex decisions and complete necessary documents, children are encouraged not to wait until they see glimmerings of fuzzy thinking or memory loss.         \n\nDementia can start years before symptoms manifest themselves, and as Anita Rosenbloom, a partner at Stroock & Stroock & Lavan and a longtime specialist in estate planning, put it, \u201cThere\u2019s never a clear line as to when a person starts to falter or decline.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nOf all the intimate conversations that take place among people close to one another \u2014 \u201cShould we get married?\u201d \u201cShould we have a baby?\u201d \u2014 few are as fraught as the one about how to dispose of a long-held family home. For parents who belong to the so-called silent generation, born in the 1920s, \u201830s and early \u201840s, and intensely private about their affairs, the reluctance to discuss financial matters can be fierce.         \n\n\u201cMy dad\u2019s 84, and he won\u2019t say one word about estate planning,\u201d said Steven Sladkus, a partner at Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman & Herz who represents co-ops and condominiums. \u201cMy brother and I have repeatedly tried to raise these issues, but he resisted us every step of the way.\u201d         \n\nEven among younger parents, the need for tact is enormous, which is why some estate-planning experts suggest raising the issue in a nonthreatening setting, perhaps over drinks or a meal.         \n\n\u201cYou might say you\u2019re doing your own financial planning as regards your home and then segue to asking your parents what they\u2019d like to see happen to their home,\u201d said Stephen Hartnett, the associate director of education of the  \n.         \n\n\u201cA child might mention an article she read about estate planning and offer to pass it along. Sometimes it\u2019s helpful to bring in an outside expert, to help defuse the situation.
