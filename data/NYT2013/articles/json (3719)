{"headline": "To Every Vegetable\u2019s Season, Another Season", "body": "\nI was strolling with Christopher Boswell in the vegetable gardens of the  \n, where he is the chef, when he saved me from a rookie mistake.         \n\nIt was late May. I had just devoured the fava-and-chicory soup he served for lunch (an earthy pur\u00e9e so thick, it clung to the spoon like mashed potatoes). I mentioned my plan to make it as soon as the legumes came into season in New York in June.         \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do it,\u201d he cautioned as he split a fat pod from the fava patch, exposing beans as big as his thumbs. \u201cYou have to wait until late in the season when the favas turn starchy, like these. The first young beans are too crisp and tender.\u201d         \n\nWithout his warning, I would have ended up with an unpleasant, granular paste.         \n\nBut Mr. Boswell\u2019s point was larger than that. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough for favas to be in season,\u201d he said. \u201cIs it late in the season or early in the season? Good cooking is about understanding the life cycle of your ingredients and knowing how to get the best out of them.\u201d         \n\nAs he summed it up, \u201cthere\u2019s a way to eat seasonally, and then there\u2019s a way to eat seasonally within the seasons.\u201d         \n\nThis sentiment, that there are seasons within seasons (call it microseasonality), is the latest paradigm for chefs and home cooks who keep a sharp eye on the calendar.         \n\n\u201cPeople assume that because I say I change the menu seasonally, that means four times a year,\u201d said Marco Canora, an owner and the chef of  \n in the East Village. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got early spring and late spring, early summer and late summer, and so on, so that means more like eight.\u201d That number grows even more if you break down each season vegetable by vegetable.         \n\nTake the tomato. The first specimens in early summer are hard and green and mildly acidic before they hit peak ripeness at the heart of the season, which is now. Late-season tomatoes are often overripe and overly soft, gaining sweetness but losing texture. End-of-season tomatoes come full circle back to green, not ripening fully before falling off the vine.         \n\nAnd they all have their place in the kitchen. Green tomatoes can be pickled, fried or made into chutneys, and their acidity can be a nice addition to a tomato salad. Sweet, ripe tomatoes are ideal for using raw in salads and sandwiches or eaten out of hand over a sink. And overripe tomatoes, caught moments before they begin to leak all over your counter, make the sweetest tomato sauces, gazpachos, dressings and braised dishes.         \n\nOr consider the difference between a slim early-season zucchini that\u2019s all crisp sweet flesh, versus a more fully grown, later-season specimen that has had a chance to grow fatter. The flesh gets flabby, the seeds larger and more distracting. Mr. Canora uses early-season zucchini in its entirety, either raw or cooked. But toward the fall, he cuts out the spongy core of seeds, saving only the firm outer shell for cooked dishes.         \n\nLate-season chile peppers get hotter. Leeks get stringier. Potatoes get sweeter and softer. Corn kernels can become chewier (and more likely to stick in your teeth).         \n\nBeing attuned to these nuances means that you can tweak dishes to best suit your produce, whatever its current state \u2014 though that may require some experimentation.         \n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just follow a recipe,\u201d said Victor Scargle, the chef at  \n in the Napa Valley of California. \u201cIt could work differently depending on how ripe your produce is, whether it\u2019s a leek or potato or tomato. You need to know how to change your technique to balance the flavors and textures.\u201d         \n\nMr. Scargle is lucky to have an extensive vegetable and fruit garden at the restaurant, and he uses his harvest at all stages of development. Even humble cilantro gets the season-spanning treatment: the baby microshoots make for garnish; mature leaves go into sauces; the flowers nestle in noodle dishes; and even the seeds are harvested and saved as a spice or crunchy topping.         \n\nOther chefs, like Seamus Mullen of  \n in the West Village, arrange to secure produce that isn\u2019t perfectly ripe. He places special orders with suppliers to get the unripe sungold cherry tomatoes he prefers for pickling.         \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re firm enough not to break down,\u201d he said. \u201cSame thing with green strawberries.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/07/dining/to-every-vegetables-season-another-season.html", "date": "2013-08-06", "description": "Is that vegetable young?
