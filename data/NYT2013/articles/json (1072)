{"headline": "Putting on the Blintz", "body": "\nThe fabulously feline chanteuse Eartha Kitt inspired these blintzes. In an otherwise insipid song called  \n recorded in the 1950s, she sings about how wealth and riches don\u2019t mean a thing if you haven\u2019t got love, rhyming \u201cprinces, schminces\u201d with \u201ccaviar and chicken blintzes.\u201d         \n\nThough the lyric refers to them as two discrete luxuries, the notion of serving savory chicken blintzes with a dollop of sour cream and a spoonful of Osetra caviar sounded awfully good. But then, what wouldn\u2019t taste good with that kind of topping?         \n\nI began to riff on the concept of an extravagant version of blintzes for a New Year\u2019s Eve supper. Instead of caviar, perhaps I could use black truffles, maybe with a few wild mushrooms? Or potato blintzes with black truffle butter? Smoked salmon blintzes with French trout roe?         \n\nIn the end I skipped both caviar and truffles and stuck with wild mushrooms, far easier on the pocketbook. The money saved could be put to good use \u2014 more Champagne! Golden chanterelles would be a delicious addition to a roasted chicken filling. And black trumpet mushrooms, sometimes called black chanterelles, have a deep woodsy flavor and look almost like truffles, but are a fraction of the cost. If they aren\u2019t available fresh, the dried ones are absolutely fine and easier to deal with. They rehydrate beautifully; a half-ounce packet goes a long way.         \n\nIf you\u2019re wondering whether it\u2019s worth going to the trouble of making blintzes at home, the answer is yes. It sounds more complicated than it really is, and the work can be parceled out into a series of manageable chores. The pancakes can be made a couple of days in advance, as can the filling. Once the little blintz bundles are assembled, they can wait in the fridge as well. The final step of browning and crisping the blintzes in butter is almost no work at all.         \n\nPut on Ms. Kitt\u2019s rendition of  \n \u2014 a far better song, actually \u2014 and raise a glass to all the possibilities of the year 2014.
