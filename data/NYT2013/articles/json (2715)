{"headline": "\u2018Carrie\u2019 Is Back. So Is Kimberly Peirce.", "body": "\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I believe in the supernatural, but Brandon Teena\u2019s story entered me in a weird way,\u201d Kimberly Peirce told me. \u201cFrom the day that I read that story, it was always my responsibility.\u201d Peirce was a graduate student at Columbia\u2019s film school when a friend gave her an article about Teena, who, though born a woman, passed as a man for years, until his biological sex was discovered and he was raped and murdered. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m a queer person, or maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m a human being, but I love Brandon so much.\u201d         \n\nPeirce took a series of odd jobs to pay for the production of a short film about Teena, which she was ultimately too broke to finish. She couldn\u2019t afford to get the dailies out of the film lab, but the producer Christine Vachon saw footage and adopted Peirce, much as Peirce had adopted Teena. It took five years, and there were many challenges, including uncertain financing and the threat of an NC-17 rating, but together they made \u201cBoys Don\u2019t Cry,\u201d the feature version of Teena\u2019s life, for a little over $2 million.         \n\nThe film, released in 1999, was an immediate sensation, not only because of the subject matter but because it was, by any standard, a remarkable directorial debut \u2014 powerfully told, visually assured and filled with breakout performances by relative newcomers, including Hilary Swank (who won an Oscar for her role), Peter Sarsgaard and Chlo\u00eb Sevigny. The film made nearly $12 million, and suddenly everyone in Hollywood was asking, \u201cWhat are you making now?\u201d Peirce spent the next nine years trying to answer that question.         \n\nPeirce and I had arranged to meet at her friend\u2019s house in Malibu, near where she lived after the success of \u201cBoys Don\u2019t Cry.\u201d We intended to take an early-afternoon walk along the beach, but she forgot to check for high tide, which left us with only a foot-wide strip of sand. So we stood there rather comically, our backs pressed against the wall of the house, two very pale people in excessive clothing on a sweltering August afternoon. Peirce has lived in Los Angeles since 2003, but still regards herself as a New Yorker, which explained her beachwear: red pants, long-sleeved T-shirt, black motorcycle jacket and boots. She reminds me of Swank as Teena: small-boned, gently seductive, androgynous yet pretty \u2014 a butch sprite.         \n\nWe gave up on our walk and moved to the house\u2019s deck, where I tried to get a handle on the large gaps in her career: the nine-year hiatus between \u201cBoys Don\u2019t Cry\u201d and her second film, \u201cStop-Loss\u201d \u2014 long by even early Terrence Malick standards (he took just five years between his first and second films) \u2014 and the five-year break between \u201cStop-Loss\u201d and her new film, a remake of \u201cCarrie,\u201d which opens Oct. 18. But as Peirce pointed out, what might have seemed like a disappearing act is instead a fairly good representation of a movie business built for easy paychecks and commercial compromises, not for making the kind of personal, character-driven films she favors. She wasn\u2019t interested in many director-for-hire gigs, turning down, among other films, \u201cMemoirs of a Geisha.\u201d And finding the kind of project she wanted to do next took a lot longer than she expected. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of director I am. I rewrite and make sure it\u2019s good and make sure I care and make sure it\u2019s human,\u201d Perice said. \u201cBecause they do take three or four years per film.\u201d After \u201cBoys,\u201d she \u201cwas still in the mode of, I\u2019m going to find a story that means something to me.\u201d         \n\nIn 2000 she stumbled onto the scandalous 1922 murder of the Hollywood director William Desmond Taylor, a case that remains unsolved, and turned it into a script called \u201cSilent Star\u201d for DreamWorks. The project \u201cwas very complicated,\u201d says Pamela Abdy, a producer who worked with Peirce on \u201cStop-Loss.\u201d \u201cShe spent a year and half of her life trying to pull that movie together. She takes a long time to do research.\u201d Peirce believes that she solved the murder in the process of investigating the story and co-writing the script. \u201cSteven Spielberg loved it,\u201d Peirce said. \u201cI had Hugh Jackman, Evan Rachel Wood and Ben Kingsley cast. We had a proposed budget of $30 million. But then DreamWorks ran the numbers, and there was a $10 million gap. I said, \u2018I\u2019ll cut $10 million.\u2019 And they said, \u2018But we don\u2019t want you to do that, because the $20 million version wouldn\u2019t be lavish enough.\u2019 Crazy, right?\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/29/magazine/carrie-is-back-so-is-kimberly-peirce.html", "date": "2013-09-26", "description": "The director of \u201cBoys Don\u2019t Cry\u201d on the career she\u2019s had and the one that might have been."}
