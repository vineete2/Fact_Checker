{"headline": "Who Made That Toothbrush?", "body": "\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any of those toothbrushes that went to the moon,\u201d says Dr. Ben Swanson, former president of the American Academy of the History of Dentistry. He was speaking from his basement, where he stores his trove of 40,000 artifacts related to dental history. Swanson once dreamed of owning every kind of toothbrush in existence, but ended up stockpiling only a few hundred. \u201cI had to give up because there were so many of them,\u201d he says. In fact, it would be nearly impossible to collect every specimen; the toothbrush is one of the most reinvented of human objects, with thousands of patents on file.         \n\nThe story starts in China during the Middle Ages, when people began grooming their teeth with animal bristles. Legend has it that centuries later, William Addis, generally recognized as the first to patent the toothbrush, served time in Newgate prison in London, where he whittled down a bone and stuck it full of bristles.         \n\nEven when toothbrushes migrated to the corner store, many people preferred to rub their teeth with a rag. As late as the 1920s, \u201cmany Americans did not brush their teeth,\u201d Swanson says. One reason is that those early toothbrushes could tear up your mouth \u2014 the tip of a boar bristle, under a microscope, resembles a spear. By the 1940s, synthetics offered a solution. One ad trumpeted: \u201cFor years, only hog bristle made fine tooth brushes. Then Science made round-end Prolon\u201d \u2014 its soft bristles were designed to preserve the gums.         \n\nThe advent of plastics also meant that toothbrushes could take any shape imaginable. And so brushes jingled and hummed tunes. They arrived on the drugstore shelf enshrined in hermetic tubes. They boasted \u201canti-soggy\u201d bristles.         \n\nAsked to pick a favorite toothbrush from his collection, Swanson says he\u2019s fond of a model that cleans both sides of the teeth at once. \u201cYou remember the Reach toothbrush with the angled head?\u201d he says. \u201cOne year they came out with a brush that had two heads.\u201d But the design failed to catch on. In the world of toothbrushes, apparently, two heads are not always better than one.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n I\u2019ve scrubbed many, many landmarks. I scrubbed the Kremlin back in \u201998. We had a mandatory-toothbrushing parade; we had the text of the mandatory-toothbrush law translated into Russian. And we had like 30 Russians; we had musicians; we had the giant toothbrushes. The police came and told us to stop, and we stopped. It was a beautiful thing.         \n\n \n Secret dental police. Government-issued toothpaste containing an addictive yet harmless substance. Computer-dental-chip implants to keep track of you and your children for your protection. For too long this nation has been suffering a great moral and oral decay.         \n\n \n That\u2019s right. When I asked Bob Dole if he supported mandatory-toothbrushing laws, his response was, \u201cAs long as it\u2019s locally controlled.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/magazine/who-made-that-toothbrush.html", "date": "2013-02-15", "description": "The story of one of the most reinvented of human objects."}
