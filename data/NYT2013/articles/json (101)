{"headline": "A New Step in Wrestling With the Bra", "body": "\nThey are the measurements that many American women (and not a few American men) know so well: 32A, 34B, 36C.         \n\nOn they go, the canonical brassiere sizes, up to at least a 50N. They have been around since the 1930s, maddeningly unconventional standards, varying from brand to brand, from demi-cup to strapless \u2014 a kaleidoscopic vision, in lace and elastic, of fashion, culture and the enduring power of marketing.         \n\nBut is anyone ready for measurements like 1-30, 7-36 and 9-42?         \n\nThose are just three of 55 new sizes that a major American manufacturer has devised to address a lament as old as the bra itself: many don\u2019t fit.         \n\nThe undergarment industry, eager to sell its wares, has seized on the complaint, offering an ever-growing assortment of sizes and shapes \u2014 often at ever-growing prices \u2014 to entice women to buy that next bra.         \n\nJockey International, a grand old name in undergarments, if a somewhat unglamorous one, has spent eight years developing the new measurement system, which the company says takes into account the shape of a woman\u2019s breasts, not merely bust size. The bras are a mass-market answer to custom fittings that have become increasingly popular in boutiques and high-end department stores.         \n\nWhether Jockey\u2019s approach will catch on is uncertain. But the Jockey Bra, formally introduced Thursday, is nonetheless another step in the evolution of the modern brassiere.         \n\nIn the 1920s flappers opted for snug bras for a boyish silhouette. By the 1950s bras that created a fuller, pointier bust were the rage. The \u201870s brought more comfortable, unstructured bras \u2014 and then Victoria\u2019s Secret.         \n\nBy the \u201890s, the Miracle Bra was battling with the Wonderbra for the title of queen of cleavage. The 2000s brought larger sizes for bigger women.         \n\nNow, as the cycle turns again, the industry is talking up the benefits of a better fit. The pitch may appeal to women newly conversant in fashion. \u201cPeople are becoming more knowledgeable about fashion minutiae, and they\u2019re focusing on things like fit,\u201d said Valerie Steele, director of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology.         \n\nIt may seem surprising but the lingerie industry itself pushes the notion that off-the-shelf bras often don\u2019t fit well. The bra manufacturer Wacoal, for instance,  \n wear the wrong size.         \n\nUntil now, however, standard sizes have barely changed, although the range has expanded. Cup sizes are based on two measurements \u2014 the breast at its fullest point, minus the rib cage measurement. If it\u2019s a one-inch difference, it\u2019s an A cup; a two-inch difference, a B cup; and so forth. That approach, Jockey executives say, doesn\u2019t account for different breast shapes.         \n\nJockey began the project by scanning 800 women, getting \u201cdata points about all of the different measurements of a woman\u2019s torso and the breast size,\u201d said Sally Tomkins, a senior vice president. Researchers followed women in their homes as they chose bras and dressed, and heard \u201ccomplete dissatisfaction about every aspect of the bra purchasing process, from the inaccuracy to the way you get measured,\u201d said Dustin Cohn, the company\u2019s chief marketing officer.         \n\nIn the end, Jockey came up with 10 cup sizes. \u201cOur bras don\u2019t necessarily get bigger, bigger, bigger, but in different proportions \u2014 they get larger, but in different shapes,\u201d Mr. Cohn said.         \n\nTo fit the bras, Jockey uses a kit with 10 plastic cups in varying shapes, along with a measuring tape. Customers are meant to try on the cups and see what works best, then measure their rib cage. Someone with a 34-inch rib cage and medium-size breasts might wear a 5-34 or a 6-34, for instance.         \n\nCharla Welch, who  \n on her blog, The Bra Crusader, said the plastic-cup approach \u201cwasn\u2019t very comfortable.\u201d \u201cMaybe it\u2019s just larger breasts, but I had to work it into the plastic cup,\u201d she said. In standard sizes, Ms. Welch is a 32H, a 9-32 in Jockey\u2019s size.         \n\nThe Jockey Bra confronts several business challenges. First, the sizing kit costs online customers $19.95, although Jockey says it includes a $20 coupon, plus a money-back guarantee on a bra if it does not fit. Other companies that sell difficult-to-fit items, such as  \n, send customers try-on versions at no cost.         \n\n\u201cEssentially they\u2019re being asked to shell out cash upfront to be part of this experiment,\u201d said Jennifer O\u2019Brien, director of strategic planning at Laird & Partners, an advertising agency, who did not work on the Jockey bra. \u201cAt least for the introductory phase, I would think that would be free. You want to remove as many barriers as possible to get people engaged with this, because it is a new world.\u201d         \n\nAnd the bra itself costs $60, more than many competitors, despite its functional looks and a limited choice of colors: beige, white or black.         \n\n\u201cIt is a high price point,\u201d Ms. Tomkins of Jockey conceded. She said the company was selling the bra only online and in its boutiques to try to get women to understand what is behind it.         \n\nAs for converting women to new ways of sizing, Ms. O\u2019Brien pointed to premium denim jeans, where women now shop by waist size, but  \n have not caught on.         \n\nMs. Tomkins said that had been a concern.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that worried us all the way through,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s always a risk when you change something that\u2019s been in the market for a very long time, but not only are we changing the fit, we\u2019re changing the whole product.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/31/business/a-new-step-in-wrestling-with-the-bra.html", "date": "2013-05-30", "description": "Jockey has devised a new way to measure bra sizes and is offering a $20 kit to help women get a better fit, in what could be a mass-market answer to custom fittings popular among women in boutiques and high-end department stores."}
