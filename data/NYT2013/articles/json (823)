{"headline": "Warrantless Cellphone Tracking Is Upheld", "body": "\nIn a significant victory for law enforcement, a federal appeals court on Tuesday said that government authorities could extract historical location data directly from telecommunications carriers without a search warrant.         \n\nThe closely watched case, in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, is the first ruling that squarely addresses the constitutionality of warrantless searches of historical location data stored by cellphone service providers. Ruling 2 to 1, the court said a warrantless search was \u201cnot per se unconstitutional\u201d because location data was \u201cclearly a business record\u201d and therefore not protected by the Fourth Amendment.         \n\nThe ruling is likely to intensify legislative efforts, already bubbling in Congress and in the  \n, to consider measures to require warrants based on probable cause to obtain cellphone location data.         \n\nThe appeals court ruling sharply contrasts with a New Jersey State Supreme Court  \n in mid-July that said the police required a warrant to track a suspect\u2019s whereabouts in real time. That decision relied on the New Jersey Constitution, whereas the ruling Tuesday in the Fifth Circuit was made on the basis of the federal Constitution.         \n\nThe Supreme Court has yet to weigh in on whether cellphone location data is protected by the Constitution. The case, which was initially brought in Texas, is not expected to go to the Supreme Court because it is \u201cex parte,\u201d or filed by only one party \u2014 in this case, the government.         \n\nBut the case could renew calls for the highest court to look at the issue, if another federal court rules differently on the same question. And  \n federal cases involving this issue are pending.         \n\n\u201cThe opinion is clear that the government can access cell site records without Fourth Amendment oversight,\u201d said Orin Kerr, a constitutional law scholar at George Washington University Law School who filed an  \n in the case.         \n\nFor now, the ruling sets an important precedent: It allows law enforcement officials in the Fifth Circuit to chronicle the whereabouts of an American with a court order that falls short of a search warrant based on probable cause.         \n\n\u201cThis decision is a big deal,\u201d said Catherine Crump, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal and a big blow to Americans\u2019 privacy rights.\u201d         \n\nThe group  \n from more than 200 local police departments last year, concluding that the demand for cellphone location data had led some cellphone companies to develop \u201csurveillance fees\u201d to enable police to track suspects.         \n\nIn reaching its decision on Tuesday, the federal appeals court went on to agree with the government\u2019s contention that consumers knowingly give up their location information to the telecommunications carrier every time they make a call or send a text message on their cellphones.         \n\n\u201cThat means it is not protected by Fourth Amendment when the government goes to a third-party service provider and issues something that is not a warrant to demand production of those records,\u201d said Mark Eckenwiler, a former Justice Department lawyer who worked on the case and is now with the Washington law firm Perkins Coie. \u201cOn this kind of historical cell site information, this is the first one to address the core constitutional question.\u201d         \n\nHistorical location data is crucial to law enforcement officials. Mr. Eckenwiler offered the example of drug investigations: A cellphone carrier can establish where a suspect met his supplier and how often he returned to a particular location. Likewise, location data can be vital in establishing people\u2019s habits and preferences, including whether they worship at a church or mosque or whether they are present at a political protest, which is why, civil liberties advocates say, it should be accorded the highest privileges of privacy protection.         \n\nThe decision could also bear implications for other government efforts to collect vast amounts of so-called metadata, under the argument that it constitutes \u201cbusiness records,\u201d as in the National Security Agency\u2019s collection of Verizon phone records for millions of Americans.         \n\n\u201cIt provides support for the government\u2019s view that that procedure is constitutional, obtaining Verizon call records, because it holds that records are business records,\u201d said Mr. Kerr, of George Washington University. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make it a slam dunk but it makes a good case for the government to argue that position.\u201d         \n\nAn important element in Tuesday\u2019s ruling is the court\u2019s presumption of what consumers should know about the way cellphone technology works. \u201cA cell service subscriber, like a telephone user, understands that his cellphone must send a signal to a nearby cell tower in order to wirelessly connect his call,\u201d the court ruled, going on to note that \u201ccontractual terms of service and providers\u2019 privacy policies expressly state that a provider uses a subscriber\u2019s location information to route his cellphone calls.\u201d         \n\nIn any event, the court added, the use of cellphones \u201cis entirely voluntary.\u201d         \n\nThe ruling also gave a nod to the way in which fast-moving technological advances have challenged age-old laws on privacy. Consumers today may want privacy over location records, the court acknowledged: \u201cBut the recourse for these desires is in the market or the political process: in demanding that service providers do away with such records (or anonymize them) or in lobbying elected representatives to enact statutory protections.\u201d         \n\nCellphone privacy measures have been proposed in the Senate and House that would require law enforcement agents to obtain search warrants before prying open location records. Montana recently became the first state to require a warrant for location data. Maine soon followed. California passed a similar measure last year but Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, vetoed it, saying it did not strike what he called the right balance between the demands of civil libertarians and the police.
