{"headline": "I Sing the Bike Electric", "body": "\nA long, long, time ago, when Twitter did not exist and the Winklevoss twins were still in high school, I got into biking. Though I was 48 when I started, I had the power and speed of a longtime features writer. Even on trips with people who appeared to be in their late 70s I was last. My last long trip, which I took with my friend Herb, was in California wine country, when the temperature was in the low 90s.         \n\n\u201cHave you noticed that the migrant workers are sitting under the shade while the two New Yorkers are out here trying to get up the hill?\u201d I asked Herb, somewhere south of Bodega Bay.         \n\nAbout a half-hour later, dazed with heat and exhaustion, I fell on a ragged piece of pavement and broke my thumb. The next year, Herb and I started renting a house in the country.         \n\nIt was in these years I learned the big lie of bike tour advertising: \u201cgently rolling hills.\u201d There are no gentle hills in biking. If it\u2019s not a big, fat geographic lump that can be viewed from space and just about kills you it is not a hill. I spent a lot of time in France and Northern California and New Jersey walking up gently rolling hills.         \n\nThis was why I was enchanted, a while back, to notice that some bike tour outfits, like  \n, were offering electric motorized bikes or e-bikes. I couldn\u2019t rent any e-bikes in New York City because while the city now has a bike-share program that encourages helmetless tourists to drive into buses and federal law allows e-bikes as long as they don\u2019t go over 20 miles an hour, riding an e-bike here can get you a $500 fine. You can buy the bikes here, you just can\u2019t ride them. The impetus was said to be speeding food delivery guys, though from what I see on the street nobody told them.         \n\nI find an e-bike company called  \n, based in Irvine, Calif., whose 56-year-old chief executive, Don DiCostanzo, arranges a loan. His boomer work-out philosophy:         \n\n\u201cWe want to get some exercise and we don\u2019t want to work too hard at it.\u201d         \n\nHis Brooklyn-based dealer, Damon Victor, at  \n, who sells throughout the northeast United States, delivers two bikes: the Step-Thru Interceptor and the City Commuter, both of which retail for $2,895. They are gorgeous, with leather seats and handlebars. They are also enormous, the Clydesdales of biking, both weighing in at just under 60 pounds. The bike I normally ride, a Terry Symmetry, is 22 pounds.         \n\nYou can ride these bikes with no motorized assistance, with occasional assistance with the turn of a hand throttle adjacent to the right handlebar, or with the push of a button near the left handlebar, which gives you constant pedal assistance in four levels up to 20 miles an hour. My average speed is 8. Damon gives me a sidewalk lesson punctuated by my hollering when I switch into a power mode and the bike rockets off. I am not used to a bike doing so much when I do nothing. In a way, it\u2019s like a vibrator.         \n\nDamon, meanwhile, is looking at me the way a sergeant regards the recruit most likely to shoot herself in the foot. Ride it like a regular bike until I get off the city streets, he tells me.         \n\nTo get the serious biker perspective, I will be riding with my colleague, Bruce Weber. He is 59 and  \n two years ago, but he also had open-heart surgery eight weeks ago so I figure we will be evenly matched. I am convinced of this when he arrives at my apartment, grabs the throttle instead of the handlebar, and the bike takes off.         \n\n\u201cWhoa!\u201d Bruce says. \u201cI almost drove into your closet.\u201d         \n\nNaturally, you are wondering how, as law-abiding New Yorkers, Bruce and I made our way to hilly roads and where, as I understood New Jersey law is hazy on e-bikes, these roads might be, and while you are wondering, let me tell you some of the ripping adventures my friend Herb and I had when we biked:         \n\nOften, in the morning, we were overtaken by whippet-thin serious bikers in spandex, who we called The Big Kids. We regarded them with awe and they regarded us as less than dirt, dirt being something you could bike over and thus had value. On long bike tours Herb and I often hopped a ride in the support vehicle, which serious riders shunned. This enabled me to identify the condition \u201cVan Shame,\u201d now recognized by the American Psychiatric Association as a serious disorder. The worst moment Herb and I had was when we were biking downhill on a New York city street and we were passed by a 7-year-old on a scooter. A 7-YEAR-OLD. By now he would be 22 or 24 if he hasn\u2019t run into a helmetless tourist on a shared bike, an event I pray for daily.
