{"headline": "Delivering KFC by Tunnel, Not Too Fast but Satisfying", "body": "\nGAZA CITY \u2014 The French fries arrive soggy, the chicken having long since lost its crunch. A 12-piece bucket goes for about $27 here \u2014 more than twice the $11.50 it costs just across the border in Egypt.         \n\nAnd for fast-food delivery, it is anything but fast: it took more than four hours for the KFC meals to arrive here on a recent afternoon from the franchise where they were cooked in El Arish, Egypt, a journey that involved two taxis, an international border, a smuggling tunnel and a young entrepreneur coordinating it all from a small shop here called Yamama \u2014 Arabic for pigeon.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our right to enjoy that taste the other people all over the world enjoy,\u201d said the entrepreneur, Khalil Efrangi, 31, who started Yamama a few years ago with a fleet of motorbikes ferrying food from Gaza restaurants, the first such delivery service here.         \n\nThere are no name-brand fast-food franchises on this 140-square-mile coastal strip of 1.7 million Palestinians, where the entry and exit of goods and people remain restricted and the unemployment rate is about 32 percent. Passage into Egypt through the Rafah crossing is limited to about 800 people a day, with men 16 to 40 years old requiring special clearance. Traveling through the Erez crossing into Israel requires a permit and is generally allowed only for medical patients, businessmen and employees of international organizations.         \n\nPalestinians generally refer to Gaza as being under siege or blockade by Israel, and isolation from the world is among the most common complaints of people here. That can create an intense longing for what those outside Gaza see as mundane, or ordinary.         \n\n\u201cThe irregular circumstances in Gaza generate an irregular way of thinking,\u201d explained Fadel Abu Heen, a professor of psychology at Al Aqsa University in Gaza City. \u201cThey think of anything that is just behind the border, exactly as the prisoner is thinking of anything beyond the bars.\u201d         \n\nProfessor Abu Heen noted that when Hamas, the militant Islamist group that controls the Gaza Strip, breached the border with Egypt in 2008, during the height of the Israeli siege, thousands of Gazans flooded into El Arish and bought not just medicine and food staples but cigarettes, candy and things they did not need \u2014 just to show they had managed to bring something back from outside. Breaking the blockade, then and now, is seen as part of resisting the Israeli enemy, giving a sense of empowerment and control to people here, even if it comes in the form of fried chicken.         \n\nEven as Israel has relaxed restrictions on imports over the past few years, hundreds of illegal tunnels have flourished in Rafah. Weapons and people are smuggled underground, but so are luxury cars, construction materials and consumer goods like iPads and iPhones. And now: KFC.         \n\nFormerly called Kentucky Fried Chicken, a KFC franchise opened in El Arish, just over Gaza\u2019s southern border, in 2011, and in the West Bank city of Ramallah last year. That, along with ubiquitous television advertisements for KFC and other fast-food favorites, has given Gazans a hankering for Colonel Sanders\u2019s secret recipe.         \n\nSo after Mr. Efrangi brought some KFC back from El Arish for friends last month, he was flooded with requests. A new business was born.         \n\n\u201cI accepted this challenge to prove that Gazans can be resilient despite the restrictions,\u201d Mr. Efrangi said.         \n\nIn the past few weeks, Mr. Efrangi has coordinated four deliveries totaling about 100 meals, making about $6 per meal in profit. He promotes the service on Yamama\u2019s Facebook page, and whenever there is a critical mass of orders \u2014 usually 30 \u2014 he starts a complicated process of telephone calls, wire transfers and coordination with the Hamas government to get the chicken from there to here.         \n\nThe other day, after Mr. Efrangi called in 15 orders and wired the payment to the restaurant in El Arish, an Egyptian taxi driver picked up the food. On the other side of the border, meanwhile, Ramzi al-Nabih, a Palestinian cabdriver, arrived at the Hamas checkpoint in Rafah, where the guards recognized him as \u201cthe Kentucky guy.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/16/world/middleeast/tunneling-kfc-to-gazans-craving-the-world-outside.html", "date": "2013-05-15", "description": "Palestinians in Gaza who crave KFC meals must order from across the border in Egypt, and the food-delivery odyssey involves two taxis, a checkpoint and a smuggling tunnel."}
