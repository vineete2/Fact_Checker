{"headline": "Markets on Edge as China Moves to Curb Risky Lending", "body": "\nHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s financial system is in danger of becoming too big to bail out.         \n\nOfficial bank lending has more than doubled since the global financial crisis, growing nearly twice as fast as the overall economy. The even bigger problem, however, appears to come from the rise of a shadow banking system that has allowed a number of companies and individuals, often with political connections, to borrow from state-controlled banks at low interest rates and relend the money at much higher rates to private businesses desperate for credit at almost any price.         \n\nNow, in an effort to wean the banks and the economy off their addiction to such risky practices, Beijing has pledged to deliver what amounts to the country\u2019s most sweeping financial overhaul in decades. Markets will play the \u201cdecisive\u201d role in directing the economy, policy makers promised last month after a key plenum meeting of the Communist Party leadership. Interest rates are to be liberalized, cross-border investment will be welcomed and regional and bureaucratic protectionism will be curtailed, they declared.         \n\nBut already, even relatively modest government moves are producing turbulence in money markets; just this week China\u2019s central bank was forced to back off, at least temporarily, to avoid putting too much stress on the banking system and potentially drawing an angry reaction from powerful vested interests in China accustomed to paying very little for their loans.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been pretty clear since June, and especially clear since the plenum, that the new crowd is interested in tightening monetary policy and letting interest rates rise,\u201d said Arthur R. Kroeber, the Beijing-based managing director of GK Dragonomics, an economic research firm. \u201cThe purpose is to reduce the rate at which credit is expanding, which has been a bit of a problem over the last couple of years.\u201d         \n\nChina has experimented twice this year with much higher, market-driven interest rates. As with  \n, the central bank allowed rates late last week and early this week to soar to unsustainable levels. Instead of regularly scheduled open-market operations, the bank tried unconventional methods of guiding money markets.         \n\nThat approach involved the central bank\u2019s turning to posts on China\u2019s Twitter-like social messaging service, Sina Weibo, to chasten banks to \u201cmake rational adjustments to the structure of their assets and liabilities, and improve their liquidity management using a scientific and long-term approach.\u201d         \n\nBut  \n, the experiment did not last long. On Tuesday, China\u2019s central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, provided a direct injection of fresh money after the market pushed seven-day interest rates to nearly 10 percent, double their earlier level. The central bank\u2019s action eased pressure on the financial system and quelled fears of an immediate credit crisis. But rates remain elevated, and the bank may have only postponed the moment of reckoning for a few months.         \n\n\u201cThe key message from the current central bank-induced tightness is deleveraging,\u201d said Stephen Green, the head of research for greater China at Standard Chartered. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens when we see greater levels of corporate distress in 2014, whether Beijing buckles or not.\u201d         \n\nA complex and loosely regulated network of financial go-betweens has sprung up to profit from repackaging and reselling China\u2019s new mountains of debt, turning loans into investment products. Such products have become popular among ordinary investors in China because they pay much higher interest rates than deposits in savings accounts, where rates are capped by the government to protect the state-owned banking system from competition.         \n\nBut loosely regulated financial businesses can make a dicey business model, as Wall Street learned in 2008. And they pose a particular threat in an economy where growth is slowing, as it has been in China for the last three years.         \n\n\u201cThe final users of the money will not be able to earn returns high enough to repay the money and promised interest,\u201d said Yu Yongding, a senior fellow at the Institute of World Economics and Politics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and a former member of the monetary policy committee at China\u2019s central bank. \u201cThe chains of lending and borrowing can be long, just like the securitized subprime mortgages. The result can be devastating.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/28/business/international/china-in-push-to-rein-in-lending-practices.html", "date": "2013-12-27", "description": "Beijing has pledged to deliver the country\u2019s most sweeping financial overhaul in decades, liberalizing interest rates and welcoming investment, but the effort is putting stress on the banking system."}
