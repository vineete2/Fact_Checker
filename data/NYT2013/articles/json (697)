{"headline": "Bipartisan Backlash Grows Against Domestic Surveillance", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration faced a growing Congressional backlash against the  \n\u2019s domestic surveillance operations on Wednesday, as lawmakers from both parties called for the vast collection of private data on millions of Americans to be scaled back.         \n\nDuring a sometimes contentious hearing of the House Judiciary Committee, Republicans and Democrats told administration officials that they believed the government had exceeded the surveillance authorities granted by Congress, and warned that they were unlikely to be reauthorized in the future.         \n\nRepresentative Jim Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin, said that no one in Congress believed that the counterterrorism laws enacted since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks were meant to allow for the collection of phone records of virtually everyone in America.         \n\n\u201cThe government is stockpiling sensitive personal data on a grand scale,\u201d said Representative Ted Deutch, Democrat of Florida. \u201cIntelligence officers, contractors and personnel only need a rubber-stamp warrant from the FISA court to then learn virtually everything there is to know about an American citizen,\u201d he said, referring to the  \n.         \n\nWhile administration officials defended the surveillance during the hearing, several lawmakers said that the data collection was unsustainable, and that Congress would move to either revoke the legislative authorization for the bulk collection now or at least refuse to renew it when it expires in 2015. Mr. Sensenbrenner interrupted James Cole, a deputy attorney general, to say, \u201cUnless you realize you\u2019ve got a problem, that is not going to be renewed.\u201d         \n\nWednesday\u2019s hearing was part of a counteroffensive emerging against the National Security Agency\u2019s domestic surveillance since the scope of the spying operations was exposed by Edward J. Snowden, a former N.S.A. contractor.         \n\nA coalition of Silicon Valley companies and civil liberties groups plans to press  \n on Thursday to disclose more information about the agency\u2019s surveillance operations so that Americans can have a more informed public debate. Much of the controversy involves the agency\u2019s bulk collection of telephone data, which includes which numbers have called other numbers and time and length of calls, but not the content.         \n\n\u00a0In a letter to top administration officials, the group will ask that the government start opening up the surveillance process by allowing companies to publicly disclose the number of secret requests for data they receive from the N.S.A., the number of individuals the requests cover, and whether the requests involve the content of communications or other data, according to a draft of the letter and interviews with officials from the companies and organizations involved.         \n\n\u00a0The group, which includes Apple, Google, Facebook and Twitter, and organizations including the  \n, the  \n and the  \n, urge in their letter that the government publish the same information, and that Congress should enact new legislation mandating greater openness in the surveillance process.\u00a0         \n\n\u00a0 The letter does not demand an end to the domestic surveillance. But it is still significant because it allies the corporations that are directly involved with the government\u2019s surveillance collection with some of the most vocal critics of the administration\u2019s efforts to keep the N.S.A. domestic spying program in the shadows.\u00a0 Microsoft sent a similar letter on its own to Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr.         \n\nThe coalition letter also comes as momentum is building in Congress to require greater public disclosure on the programs. \u201cI am beginning to see a lot of Republicans fight on this issue,\u201d Representative Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat and member of the Judiciary Committee, said in an interview. \u201cI think the situation is extremely fluid, but I know a lot of people are interested in doing something.\u201d         \n\nSenator  \n, Democrat of Minnesota, said in an interview that he planned to introduce legislation mandating public disclosure along the same lines as the recommendations in the coalition\u2019s letter, while Representative Rick Larsen, a Washington Democrat, said in an interview that he was planning to introduce similar legislation in the House on Thursday.         \n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Sensenbrenner and Representative Zoe Lofgren, the California Democrat who is the ranking minority member on the judiciary panel, sent a letter to Mr. Holder and James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, also asking that the companies be allowed to disclose more information publicly about government demands for data.         \n\nMr. Sensenbrenner released a letter Wednesday from the Justice Department, defending the scope and the legality of the government\u2019s surveillance operations. The department said that it was necessary for the N.S.A. to collect such large volumes of domestic telephone data to perform the analysis necessary to identify suspected terrorist activity.         \n\nMr. Franken said that he believed the administration now agreed that there needed to be greater public debate and disclosure, even though the White House has continued to defend the secret programs. \u201cI think that if there were greater transparency, Americans would have a better understanding of these programs,\u201d he said.         \n\nWhile prominent Internet companies are pushing for fuller disclosure, some of the nation\u2019s largest telecommunications firms were not willing to sign on, according to several people involved in the coalition. Some of those businesses have previously received legal immunity from Congress for their involvement with the Bush administration\u2019s warrantless wiretapping program, and have close and longstanding ties to the N.S.A.         \n\nBut the Silicon Valley Internet firms that did sign did so because they are increasingly concerned that the N.S.A. controversy that erupted in the wake of Mr. Snowden\u2019s disclosures could damage their credibility, particularly with customers overseas.         \n\n\u201cThe commercial issue is whether people around the world are going to trust American Internet companies with their data,\u201d said Andrew McLaughlin, the chief executive of Digg, a social news Web site, and a former White House Internet policy adviser in the Obama administration. \u201cIf you are in the government in Germany, you might think twice about using an American company as your cloud partner. You might see American companies not winning those kinds of contracts.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/18/us/politics/bipartisan-backlash-grows-against-domestic-surveillance.html", "date": "2013-07-17", "description": "Lawmakers from both parties called for the collection of the private data of millions of Americans to be scaled back."}
