{"headline": "Bully Wallpaper and a Ceiling Lost in Space", "body": "\nThe great halls of Grand Central, the  \n and the  \n each present different painted faces: Grand Central has a swath of the heavens at nighttime, redone 15 years ago; the natural history museum has murals of the life of Theodore Roosevelt, restored last fall; and the Metropolitan Museum, well ... where are the murals, anyway?         \n\nGrand Central opened in 1913 with what is perhaps the greatest typo in the history of American architecture. The pastel artist  \n, seeking to reproduce the nighttime constellations in winter, got them backward.\u00a0 That\u2019s it; flat backward \u2014 200-plus feet of backward.\u00a0         \n\nWhen the terminal opened to adulatory reviews, this little detail did not appear; rather it was a  \n from  \n, N.Y., who called the problem to everybody\u2019s attention.\u00a0 (To his chagrin, the present author, president of his high school\u2019s astronomy club, did not notice this until well into adulthood.)         \n\nThe railroad, the architects, the artist, stumbled to explain that they meant to give railroad passengers the sense of looking down on earth from space, but it appears the ceiling mural had been copied incorrectly, working from the wrong side from a star chart. Or something.\u00a0 If the Apollo 13 crew had had to navigate on the basis of Helleu\u2019s mural, they would be well past Pluto by now.\u00a0         \n\nStill, it is an agreeable thing, a sweep of turquoise with little white lights, although a couple of meteors would have given it some pizazz.         \n\nThe railroad gave Helleu the sky, but over at  \n, the American Museum of Natural History gave  \n the closet.\u00a0He received three of them \u2014 specifically, colossal recessed spaces that he filled to the edges with giant brightly colored scenes of Roosevelt\u2019s giant-size life.         \n\nFinished in 1936, the murals are screened by large marble columns, so the observer can never take in the whole work.\u00a0         \n\nIf Mackay beefed about it, the matter has not surfaced; surely in this mid-Depression year scores of muralists envied the commission. \u00a0The hall itself has a rich coffered ceiling in the Classical mode, but the murals are strictly narrative passages, each panel crammed with depictions of Roosevelt\u2019s African hunting expeditions, the building of the Panama Canal and his role in settling the Russo-Japanese War.         \n\nDuring World War I, Mackay was a naval artist in what was called dazzle camouflage \u2014 wild kinetic slices, wedges, stripes and polygons painted in brilliantly contrasting colors, like purple and pink.\u00a0 A Cubist take on Op Art is one way to look at it.\u00a0         \n\nHe took no such liberties with T. R.\u2019s career, but crowded each frame with dozens of scenes, like Columbus sailing the Atlantic in 1492, engineers and laborers on the Canal, Genghis Khan, a Shinto priest in prayer, the sons of Noah, a group of Gr\u00e9vy\u2019s zebras, all nestled together as if pasted into a collage.         \n\nAnd there is plenty of dazzle, too; but in this case it\u2019s a blinding set of yellows and reds. \u00a0Indeed, the works are very hard to interpret: densely packed, starting well above eye level and extending up perhaps 30 feet, sectioned off into niches and chopped up by the columns.\u00a0 Binoculars help, slightly.         \n\nSome may see the murals as pure jingoism. Others may find it heroic and inspiring that a single man could accomplish so much in a lifetime, a story barely covered by the one-page handout at the information desk.\u00a0Nor is there a postcard or other evidence of the murals in the gift shop.\u00a0 If you visit, you will have the rare treat of seeing a work of art almost completely unmediated, unmerchandised.\u00a0         \n\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s Great Hall of 1902 was designed by Richard Morris Hunt just before he died in 1895, leaving tantalizing and sketchy ideas, like the four blocks of uncarved limestone at the top of the main facade on Fifth Avenue.\u00a0His sons continued the work, but budget problems and infighting left many things undone or reduced in scope. For instance, the hall was to be in rich white marble instead of the present limestone.\u00a0         \n\nIn most other Beaux-Arts buildings, the role of the sculptor and muralist is important: the architecture critic Henry Hope Reed has said a building is naked without such decoration.\u00a0 But the triple-dome ceiling at the Met is as bare as a baby\u2019s bottom, just a fluffy beige, the lighting adjusted to make the space mushy and indeterminate.\u00a0         \n\nLittle was written about the interior, and perhaps the only reference to a mural program appears in The New York Times in 1899, when a reviewer remarked that the neutral limestone was to be set off by murals that \u201cwill supply the color necessary for an effect of brilliance.\u201d \u00a0         \n\nThat is hardly conclusive, but what if one were to dare to create a series of murals for the Metropolitan interior today?\u00a0 Jeff Greene, the founder of  \n , which restored the Roosevelt murals, pauses at the thought, and says they would almost certainly be purely decorative, without narrative content.\u00a0 The agreement of a century ago about heroism, ideals, culture \u2014 even our history \u2014 no longer exists.\u00a0 \u201cToday,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s like speaking Latin.\u201d\u00a0        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/realestate/when-murals-were-in-flower.html", "date": "2013-04-11", "description": "New York\u2019s three great halls, at Grand Central Terminal, the American Museum of Natural History and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, each have an artistic side."}
