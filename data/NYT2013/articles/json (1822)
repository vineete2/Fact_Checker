{"headline": "Wasting No Time, Cashman Tries to Keep Girardi With the Yankees", "body": "\nBrian Cashman spoke for 50 minutes 31 seconds at his annual end-of-season news conference Tuesday, an unusually long dialogue. But after a disappointing 2013 season, in which the Yankees failed to make the playoffs for only the second time in 19 years, there were many topics to discuss.         \n\nCashman has already begun addressing the club\u2019s most urgent needs, beginning with an aggressive move to re-sign Manager Joe Girardi. Cashman met with Girardi over coffee Monday and plans to meet with Girardi\u2019s agent, Steve Mandell, for lunch Wednesday, when a formal contract offer could be presented and the matter resolved quickly.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to give him a real good reason to stay,\u201d Cashman said, \u201cand I think he\u2019s earned that through his first six years with us.\u201d         \n\nGirardi\u2019s current deal, which expires Nov. 1, is for three years for about $9 million. Girardi said Sunday that he hoped to settle the issue soon. There has been speculation that the Chicago Cubs, who just fired Dale Sveum as manager, may have an interest in Girardi, and his name has been mentioned with the Washington Nationals\u2019 job. Cashman would not say whether the Cubs or any other team had asked for permission to speak with Girardi, or whether he would grant it.         \n\nCashman credited Girardi with doing a strong job this season, even though the team did not make the playoffs for the first time since 2008, Girardi\u2019s first year. Cashman acknowledged that the long list of troublesome injuries took its toll and accepted responsibility for the team missing the playoffs. He said Girardi did a \u201ctremendous job\u201d and said Girardi got as much out of the players as he could, keeping them competitive to the end.         \n\n\u201cWe got derailed this year by decision-making as well as injuries,\u201d Cashman said, referring to himself. \u201cThey are all my responsibility, and the best we could produce, unfortunately, was an 85-win team. That\u2019s not Yankee standards.\u201d         \n\nThe effort to fix an aging, injury-riddled roster will begin Monday, when Cashman will preside over pro scouting meetings at Yankee Stadium. During those gatherings, the scouts and the front office will draw up a list of possible players whom they might be able to acquire, through free agency or trades.         \n\nLooming over that entire process is the $189 million payroll benchmark set forth in the recent collective bargaining agreement that the Yankees would like to stay under in order to lower their luxury tax threshold and reap substantial incentive payments.         \n\nBut Cashman reiterated what Hal Steinbrenner, the managing general partner, said on several occasions: the priority is to field a championship team, and if that cannot be done under $189 million, then the Yankees will exceed it, despite the heavy cost.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly a goal,\u201d Cashman said of meeting the threshold. \u201cIt\u2019s not a mandate. It\u2019s a goal that we have, and if it\u2019s possible, there\u2019s a lot of benefit to staying under that. But it\u2019s not a mandate if it\u2019s at the expense of a championship.\u201d         \n\nThe Yankees will have $41.15 million to $108.15 million coming off the books for 2014, depending on whether several players \u2014 Robinson Cano, Curtis Granderson and Hiroki Kuroda \u2014 leave in free agency and whether Alex Rodriguez\u2019s 211-game suspension is upheld in arbitration. (The Yankees would save $25 million even if the suspension were reduced to 162.)         \n\nThe Yankees are also considering ways to improve their amateur player procurement. Ownership is concerned that the team\u2019s drafting in recent years has not yielded great success, and that department, headed by Damon Oppenheimer, could face changes.         \n\nBut there is almost no position that does not need to be addressed. Cashman noted that of the four infield positions, three remain uncertain, but he could have said all four, including first base, as Mark Teixeira is coming off wrist surgery.         \n\nRodriguez is in the midst of an arbitration battle to stave off his suspension for supposedly using performance-enhancing drugs, Derek Jeter is coming off a major ankle injury that limited him to 17 games and Cano is expected to file for free agency.         \n\nCano asked for a 10-year, $310 million contract, which the Yankees will not give him. They have made a substantial offer and are expected to sweeten it, perhaps to as high as $25 million per season over seven or eight years, but that may not be enough to satisfy Cano. Cashman has appealed to Cano\u2019s possible desire to retire a Yankee and receive the same kind of adulation that Mariano Rivera and Andy Pettitte did.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019d love to have Robbie back,\u201d Cashman said, adding: \u201cHe\u2019s been a great Yankee. I think if he stays he\u2019ll have a legitimate chance to experience what you just saw for Mariano. Maybe he has the chance to be the first Dominican-born player in Monument Park. A homegrown Yankee. But at the same time, it\u2019s a business.\u201d         \n\nJeter, meanwhile, will play only shortstop or designated hitter, Cashman said.         \n\nThe starting rotation has only two certainties, C. C. Sabathia and Ivan Nova, and no one can guarantee what those two will provide after inconsistent seasons. Pettitte retired, Kuroda may elect to leave in free agency and Phil Hughes is expected to be nontendered and leave in free agency. Michael Pineda is coming off shoulder surgery and has everything to prove.         \n\nAfter 50 minutes of answers, Cashman barely discussed the catcher position or the bullpen, which has been a strength, but with Rivera retiring, there are questions there, too. His most telling comment came in a two-second burst.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of problems that we need to attack,\u201d he said.
