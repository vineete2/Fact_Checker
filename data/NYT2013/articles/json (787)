{"headline": "The Joy of Triplets\u2019 Graduation, One After Another, After Another", "body": "\nWhenever my wife, Connie, and I mention that we have three children the same age, the common and endearing reaction is: \u201cTriplets. Wow.\u201d And wow, in all good senses of the word, it is.         \n\nMost days you\u2019re doing what everybody else does \u2014 the laundry, driving to Little League practice, trying to remember if you have ever really read \u201cEast of Eden\u201d when one of the children is writing a paper on John Steinbeck \u2014 until those occasions when, suddenly, everything is emphatically times three, when the wow comes with an exclamation point. The college application process is one of those times. Graduation is another.         \n\nIn our case it was Rebecca at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill.; James at Bates in Lewiston, Me.; and Anna, at Colgate in Hamilton, N.Y. Three college graduations in a five-week span, two of them on successive weekends. They were exhilarating, of course, and momentous.         \n\nThey were exhausting, too. All the celebrating can lead to a condition best described as being wrungover, brought on by tears, hugs, handshakes, heartfelt compliments and toasts; wine, beer and Champagne are not required components, though they are usually in the mix.         \n\nThe three ceremonies by the numbers: Two honorary degrees presented to yogurt magnates. Two rainy weekends. Four new umbrellas. Two brew pubs, one sports bar. And the most important number: three graduates.         \n\nThe marathon started with planning the weekends even before junior year was over.         \n\nTo secure a room in Evanston the requisite months in advance, I got up at 2 a.m. Eastern time to call a hotel that began taking reservations an hour before. We reserved a table at Fuel, a nice restaurant in Lewiston, almost a year out. Getting into the Colgate on graduation weekend? Next to impossible (we didn\u2019t).         \n\nIt was like planning a Rolling Stones tour, and there were times when it made you feel like one of the Stones (the Stones now; not the guys you listened to in college).         \n\nAnna\u2019s Colgate graduation weekend, which began on May 17, was the first, which was fitting: she was the first to have been dropped off four years earlier.         \n\nThere was a ritual stop for cheeseburgers at Gilligan\u2019s in Sherburne on the way up, a beer at a new brew pub called Good Nature Brewing in Hamilton, and then a round of meals, parties and receptions at places that had become familiar over the college years, a well-worn graduation weekend path followed by parents and seniors at colleges everywhere. We had a post-commencement lunch at Ye Olde Landmark Tavern in nearby Bouckville, which was where we had dined the first time Anna had visited Colgate (you try to bring everything full circle).         \n\nOne of Colgate\u2019s most prominent traditions is a torchlight ceremony on the Saturday night before graduation, during which about-to-be graduates wear their gowns and, lighted torches in one hand, descend from a hilltop and parade past parents, undergraduates and faculty members before tossing the torches into a face-melting bonfire.         \n\nThe moment had been billed as bittersweet, and it was. As Anna later wrote (because I asked each of our kids to write down some things that they would remember): \u201cFire dripped from my torch and left a scar on my arm. But if I am to have a scar from anything I will be happy to look at that little burn mark and be reminded of my four glorious years at Colgate.\u201d         \n\nA half-hour later, period of reflection over, Connie sighed and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to wash the beer off my shoes.\u201d         \n\nThe commencement ceremony was the next day in a fieldhouse on campus, where Hamdi Ulukaya, who started Chobani yogurt, received an honorary degree. (At Bates, the yogurt star turn was by Gary Hirshberg, chairman of Stonyfield Farm; he also delivered the commencement address. Yogurt at Northwestern could be found at a local Red Mango store.)         \n\nOne of the truisms about any college graduation is that at least one speech will be much better than you expected. At Colgate, the featured speaker was Duncan L. Niederauer, an alumnus and the chief executive of NYSE Euronext, and the initial thought was, sounds like 40 minutes about finance.
