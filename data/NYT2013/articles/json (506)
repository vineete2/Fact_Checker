{"headline": "The All-Important Present Moment", "body": "\n \n Andrei Tarkovsky\u2019s 1979 film \u201cStalker\u201d may be the slowest movie ever made. At 163 perversely action-sapped minutes, it makes shifting tectonic plates look positively sprightly by comparison.         \n\nTo the extent that it\u2019s about anything, \u201cStalker\u201d is about two men, known only as the Writer and the Professor, who hire a guide (the Stalker) to lead them through a post-apocalyptic wasteland called the Zone to a mystical place called the Room, where their deepest desires will be fulfilled.         \n\nThe payoff is paltry. When the three men arrive at the entrance to the Room, the Professor reveals his plan to blow it up. His plan is thwarted, nobody goes inside and no desires are granted. \u201cIn any case, the whole idea of the Room is a joke,\u201d writes Geoff Dyer in \u201cZona,\u201d his book on the film. \u201cPerhaps our deepest wish in life is that there could be a place like this, a Room where our deepest wish comes true. Extrapolating from that, we don\u2019t want to get to the point where we discover that we actually don\u2019t want this room to exist. . . . One\u2019s deepest desire changes from day to day, moment to moment.\u201d         \n\nDyer has likened the Zone to the cinema \u2014 a place \u201cwhere ultimate truths are revealed.\u201d And perhaps the truth can thrive there, Dyer writes jokingly, because the Zone \u201cis one of the few territories left \u2014 possibly the only one \u2014 where the rights to \u2018Top Gear\u2019 have not been sold.\u201d And it\u2019s true. There really aren\u2019t many places left on Earth \u2014 real, fictional, imaginary or otherwise \u2014 where we\u2019re not being told exactly what to long for, and where to get it, all the time.         \n\n \n Tarkovsky wrote a book about cinema called \u201cSculpting in Time.\u201d At least this was the English title. It can be translated more literally as \u201cDepicted Time\u201d or \u201cWritten Time,\u201d which sound less poetic but feel more accurate. A devotee of eternal takes and glacial tracking shots, Tarkovsky was a sworn nemesis of rapid-cut editing and other filmic conventions that alter our perception of time, which we, the audience, often expect and demand. For Tarkovsky, the cinematic image was \u201cessentially the observation of a phenomenon passing through time,\u201d and an image became \u201cauthentically cinematic when (amongst other things) not only does it live within time, but time also lives within it.\u201d         \n\n \n If you\u2019re looking for a brief definition of exactly what Hollywood movies are not at this moment, you could do a lot worse than this characterization.         \n\n \n The other day I passed a billboard for \u201cMan of Steel,\u201d the new Superman movie, and for a second I imagined what would happen if it were instead marketed as something like \u201cThis Again.\u201d Of course that would never happen, because the culture is now locked in an infinite, recursive feedback loop that can never be officially acknowledged lest it short-circuit and cease to self-perpetuate.         \n\nOur experience of time and space has radically shifted as technology has collapsed, compressed, chopped, flipped and scrambled it, teppanyaki-style. As Douglas Rushkoff writes in \u201cPresent Shock,\u201d his new book about technology and time: \u201cOur society has reoriented itself to the present moment.\u201d As a result, our experience has become, he notes, \u201can entropic, static hum of everybody trying to capture the slipping moment. . . . What we are doing at any given moment becomes all-important \u2014 which is behavioristically doomed.\u201d         \n\nMost mainstream movies are less interested in observing phenomena passing through time than they are in observing objects flying through space (teppanyaki-style) and less concerned with revealing ultimate truths than selling infinite tickets. This has always been so, only more so lately. It seems as if the more a movie promises to manipulate, negate, ignore or just plain refuse to acknowledge or engage with the passage of time, the more entertaining and therefore commercial it\u2019s perceived to be. Which is behavioristically doomed.
