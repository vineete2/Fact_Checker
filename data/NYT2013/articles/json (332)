{"headline": "Bloomberg Reporters\u2019 Practices Become Crucial Issue for Company", "body": "\nMost journalists dream of uncovering government corruption, landing a big interview or winning a Pulitzer Prize. But those are not the goals that Thomas F. Secunda, who co-founded  \n in 1982 with Michael R. Bloomberg, has in mind.         \n\n\u201cThe only journalism that matters is the kind that moves markets,\u201d Mr. Secunda told the senior staff of Bloomberg News during a recent discussion in the seventh-floor auditorium of the company\u2019s Lexington Avenue headquarters, according to one former Bloomberg journalist in attendance.         \n\nThe question of how exactly some of those Bloomberg reporters may have uncovered market-moving information has become a critical one for the company.         \n\nIn April, Goldman Sachs complained that a reporter had monitored an executive\u2019s activities on the Bloomberg machine, the ubiquitous financial terminal that contains a mind-boggling array of information about economies, companies, markets and people, including Bloomberg\u2019s own customers. The revelation prompted inquiries from more than 20 customers, including Bank of America, the Federal Reserve, the Treasury Department and the European Central Bank.  \n, chief executive of Bloomberg, apologized, calling the reporting practice a \u201cmistake.\u201d         \n\nBut interviews with more than 30 current and former Bloomberg employees paint a picture of an aggressive, hyperkinetic organization that not only tolerated but encouraged an unusual symbiotic relationship between the company\u2019s news operation and its business interests, including the use of the terminals to break news.         \n\nMany of these reporters say they routinely used the terminal\u2019s function, called the UUID command, to  \n, including contact information, when the subscriber had last logged on, and weekly statistics on how often customers used a particular function, like equity shares or currency markets.         \n\nReporters also say they talked to their business-side colleagues to gain early access to company announcements, including company releases and bond prospectuses about to be made public, and queried Bloomberg\u2019s own help desk to find out what pages and features customers might have been using.         \n\n\u201cWe were told again and again and again, find ways to use what\u2019s on the terminal to write stories,\u201d said one former Bloomberg reporter who, like most employees, was required to sign a strict nondisclosure agreement that prohibits them from speaking about the company. \u201cThey never said \u2018Oh, please be careful and don\u2019t breach any kind of privacy,\u2019\u00a0\u201d the former reporter said.         \n\nA senior Bloomberg executive not authorized to speak for attribution confirmed the reporter\u2019s account. \u201cIt\u2019s not like this was some deep Bloomberg secret,\u201d this executive said. \u201cIf it\u2019s on the terminal, we\u2019d say go for it.\u201d         \n\nIn the opaque world of Wall Street where traders tightly protect every shred of information, the privacy breach threatens to undermine Bloomberg\u2019s core terminal business \u2014 which takes up 26 floors at Bloomberg\u2019s New York headquarters, compared with four floors for the news unit. Bloomberg leases more than 315,000 of its roughly $20,000-a-year financial data computers, which made up 85 percent of the company\u2019s 2012 revenue of $7.9 billion.         \n\nAfter Goldman complained, Bloomberg immediately shut newsroom access to the UUID function. Mr. Doctoroff promised an independent inquiry to be led by Samuel J. Palmisano, the former chairman and chief executive of I.B.M., who is a board member of Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s charitable group. Mr. Doctoroff also appointed a senior executive to the newly created Bloomberg position of client data compliance officer.         \n\nAlthough Bloomberg has acted swiftly, several people close to the company said executives considered the controversy overblown, fanned by Wall Street banks frustrated with aggressive news coverage and eager to negotiate cheaper rates for terminals. Bloomberg controls more than a third of the $25.5 billion financial data services market, according to Burton-Taylor International Consulting.         \n\nCompetitors have already pounced. At an investor conference on May 28, Lex Fenwick, chief executive of Dow Jones & Company, publisher of The Wall Street Journal, and former chief executive of Bloomberg L.P. introduced a Dow Jones messaging system which, he said, would be \u201cstrictly stored on your servers and we can\u2019t see what you\u2019re saying to each other.\u201d         \n\nYvonne Diaz, a spokeswomen for Thomson Reuters, said \u201cthere are strict controls in place that prevent any Reuters or other staff outside of the development and customer service groups from accessing\u201d customer data. But in a sign of just how competitive the market for financial news and analytics has become, Thomson Reuters allows a tier of select clients early access, by two seconds, to consumer sentiment data through an agreement with the University of Michigan. The unusual arrangement was  \n.         \n\nA Bloomberg spokesman, Ty Trippet, said that while management did encourage the use of terminal data in reporting, the company did not condone looking at confidential customer information, and all new employees were required to sign a confidentiality agreement that prohibited them from doing just that. He also pointed out that reporters could never see a subscriber\u2019s specific trades, securities or news articles they had viewed.
