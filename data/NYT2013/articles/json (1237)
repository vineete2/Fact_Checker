{"headline": "President Claims Shooting as a Hobby, and the White House Offers Evidence", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 When  \n  \n that he had picked up a new hobby \u2014 skeet shooting at Camp David \u2014 it was a surprising disclosure by a president whose main identification with guns these days is  \n to ban assault rifles and high-capacity magazines.         \n\nTo some, Mr. Obama\u2019s newfound enthusiasm for shooting clay pigeons \u2014 he said in an interview that he did it \u201call the time\u201d at the presidential retreat \u2014 also seemed a bit suspicious.         \n\nSo on Saturday, the White House tried to silence the skeptics by releasing a photograph of Mr. Obama shooting on the range at Camp David in August. The president, wearing protective glasses and ear-muffs, is squinting down the barrel of a shotgun moments after pulling the trigger. Smoke is shooting from the front of the gun.         \n\nThe White House said the photo was taken on Aug. 4, Mr. Obama\u2019s 51st birthday. But it offered no further details on whether his target practice was a regular hobby or a one-time event.         \n\nThe notion of the president taking aim at targets flung into the air captivated some in the political and social media worlds at a time when he is pushing Congress to enact sweeping restrictions on high-capacity rifles and magazines.         \n\nConservatives scoffed, comics mocked, a congresswoman challenged him to a skeet-shooting contest, a fake picture of an armed Mr. Obama circulated on the Internet, and the White House tried to make the whole matter go away.         \n\n\u201cIt was a surprise to a lot of people in the industry when we saw that and heard that,\u201d said Michael Hampton Jr., the executive director of the National Skeet Shooting Association, whose 35,000 members do not include the president.         \n\nMr. Obama is hardly the first politician to draw scorn for boasting of experience with guns. In 2007, during his first presidential campaign, former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts was ridiculed when he said, \u201cI\u2019ve always been a rodent and rabbit hunter \u2014 small varmints, if you will.\u201d In 2004, John Kerry, then a presidential candidate and now secretary of state, was lampooned for showing up in camouflage to go hunting less than two weeks before the election.         \n\nThe latest commotion has its origins in the interview Mr. Obama gave to The New Republic, now owned by Chris Hughes, a Facebook co-founder and former Obama campaign aide. In the interview, Franklin Foer, the magazine\u2019s editor, referred to the fight over gun control and asked if the president had ever fired a gun.         \n\n\u201cYes, in fact, up at Camp David, we do skeet shooting all the time,\u201d Mr. Obama said.         \n\n\u201cThe whole family?\u201d Mr. Foer asked.         \n\n\u201cNot the girls,\u201d he said, \u201cbut oftentimes guests of mine go up there. And I have a profound respect for the traditions of hunting that trace back in this country for generations. And I think those who dismiss that out of hand make a big mistake.\u201d         \n\nMr. Obama went on to say that the reality of guns in urban areas differs from that in rural areas. \u201cSo it\u2019s trying to bridge those gaps that I think is going to be part of the biggest task over the next several months,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that means that advocates of gun control have to do a little more listening than they do sometimes.\u201d         \n\nThe skeet-shooting comment caught many off guard because it is not something the president has talked about. While other presidents have used the skeet-shooting range at Camp David, database searches of Mr. Obama\u2019s speeches and interviews turned up no mention of participating.         \n\n\u201cI would refer you simply to his comments,\u201d Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, told reporters who asked after the interview was published how often the president shoots. \u201cI don\u2019t know how often. He does go to Camp David with some regularity, but I\u2019m not sure how often he\u2019s done that.\u201d         \n\nAsked why no one had seen a picture or heard about it before, Mr. Carney said, \u201cBecause when he goes to Camp David, he goes to spend time with his family and friends and relax, not to produce photographs.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/us/politics/obamas-skeet-shooting-comments-draw-fire.html", "date": "2013-02-02", "description": "Comments by the president\u2019s that he shoots clay pigeons \u201call the time\u201d at Camp David draw surprise \u2014 and skepticism."}
