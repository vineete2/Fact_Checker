And with so many games on television and with fans posting more and more video onto sites like YouTube, wondrous goals are never far from the public eye.         \n\nEach year FIFA brings together a collection of what it believes to be the year\u2019s best (at least from November to November), opens voting and names a winner of the  \n Award (named after the famous Hungary and Real Madrid star) at its annual awards ceremony.         \n\nFIFA\u2019s 10 goals (in alphabetical order of the scorer\u2019s names):         \n\nPeter Ankersen \u2014 Aug. 10, 2013 \u2014  \n         \n\nLisa De Vanna \u2014 June 1, 2013 \u2014  \n         \n\nAntonio Di Natale \u2014 April 7, 2013 \u2014  \n         \n\nZlatan Ibrahimovic \u2014 Nov. 13, 2012 \u2014  \n         \n\nPanagiotis Kone \u2014 Dec. 16, 2012 \u2014  \n         \n\nDaniel Ludue\u00f1a \u2014 July, 27 2013 \u2014  \n         \n\nNemanja Mativ \u2014 Jan. 13, 2013 \u2014  \n         \n\nLouisa N\u00e9cib \u2014 March 17, 2013 \u2014  \n         \n\nNeymar \u2014 June 15, 2013 \u2014  \n         \n\nJuan Manuel Olivera \u2014 Aug. 28, 2013 \u2014  \n         \n\nYou can cast your vote (until Dec. 9) at  \n. At the close of the first stage of voting, the top three votegetters will be announced and another round of voting will begin to select the winner. The winner will be revealed on the day of the  \n on Jan. 13, 2014. Voting will close during the show.         \n\nThere were at least a few possible goals of the year left off the list:         \n\nFulham\u2019s Pajtim Kasami vs. Crystal Palace, Oct. 21, 2013         \n\nRed Bulls\u2019 Thierry Henry vs. Montreal, May 8, 2013         \n\nArsenal\u2019s Jack Wilshere vs. Norwich City, Oct. 19, 2013         \n\nParis St.-Germain\u2019s Zlathan Ibrahimovic vs. Anderlecht, Oct. 23, 2013         \n\nDo you have a favorite goal of the year you think should have been among FIFA\u2019s top 10?
