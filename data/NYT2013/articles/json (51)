{"headline": "Bandages Not Included", "body": "\nOF the many primal noises to emanate from the modern kitchen \u2014 crackle, sizzle, \u201cmmm\u201d and so forth \u2014 \u201cAAAGGGHHH!\u201d is not one anybody wants to hear. But that\u2019s what shattered the uneasy peace last July 4 at the white clapboard house my in-laws rent every year in Annisquam, Mass.         \n\nThe sound was coming from my mouth. And the blood was seeping from my left index and middle fingers, which seconds earlier had been trying, with some absence of mind, to pry stiff clumps of butter intended for chocolate-chip  \n from the blades of an  \n. The countertop beneath looked like the set of Dan Aykroyd\u2019s famous and gory  \n on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d in 1978.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll never play the viola again,\u201d was the first thought to flash through my mind. (I haven\u2019t touched the instrument in 20 years.)         \n\nMonths after the surgical tape and splint came off, I typed the words  \n \u2014 tentatively, as there is still some numbness \u2014 and learned of the device\u2019s invention in the 1950s by a Swiss man, Roger Perrinjaquet, who called it a  \n, combining the French verbs \u201cbattre,\u201d meaning to beat, and \u201cmixer.\u201d Also known as a stick blender, a wand blender or (perhaps less felicitously) a hand blender, it\u2019s a longtime staple of restaurant kitchens that has been taken up by the increasingly ardent home cook over the past decade. Results have been, well, mixed.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gained popularity from the smoothies,\u201d said Dr.  \n, a hand surgeon and clinical associate professor of orthopedic surgery at the New York University School of Medicine, who estimates he has treated about a half-dozen immersion blender injuries, many of which involve severed nerves and tendons, in the past two years.         \n\nSold by most leading cookware manufacturers, including Cuisinart, KitchenAid and Hamilton Beach, the immersion blender sells for about $50 to $200 and enables the quick whipping-up of soups, sauces and other soft foods directly in the pan or serving bowl. The menacing mincer attachment, sometimes interchangeable with a whisk, snaps onto a footlong shaft and is powered up to several hundred watts with a soft button that responds to the gentle pressure of a thumb. Or a sea breeze, if you ask a few of those scarred by it.         \n\nBecause of the sensitivity of this button, it is very, very important that you unplug the gizmo before cleaning \u2014 or else grasp all too quickly why my 4-year-old son thinks it is called an \u201cemergency blender.\u201d         \n\nSuch a safety precaution seems obvious, right?         \n\nNot to Brendan Fitzgerald, 30, a screenwriter whose run-in with an immersion blender last summer led his girlfriend, the novelist Kate Christensen, to  \n for a concoction she called Blood Pesto on her blog. (\u201cWith a mezzaluna, not an immersion blender, chop several large handfuls of fresh basil as finely as you can,\u201d it begins, tellingly.)         \n\n\u201cWhen you hold the thing, it\u2019s so trigger-happy,\u201d Mr. Fitzgerald said in plaintive tones over the phone from Portland, Me., describing how his \u201chorrible, guttural scream\u201d was followed by seven stitches to his left middle finger after he attempted to untangle basil leaves from a plugged-in immersion blender. \u201cThere\u2019s something so innocuous about it,\u201d he said of the gadget, which comes in colors like hot pink and teal. \u201cIt looks like a child\u2019s toy.\u201d         \n\nMr. Fitzgerald said he was not usually the one in the house who cooks, and this resonated; few would call me aces in the kitchen either. When a character in the recent  \n said of his wife, \u201cKeep her away from the ingredients,\u201d my husband laughed knowingly. The immersion blender, he pointed out after my accident, is better suited for frothing cocktails than heavy-duty baking tasks. (He added jokes about Bloody Marys and \u201ctwo fingers of rum\u201d for good measure.)         \n\nBut I have several sisters in my foul-up. Erica Schrag, 29, a digital strategist in the Atlanta office of Edelman, a public relations firm, was also trying to cream butter, for pecan tarts, when the unfortunate occurred.         \n\n\u201cI kept saying it was my Liz Lemon moment \u2014 I\u2019m going to die alone in my house,\u201d said Ms. Schrag, adding that it took medical personnel five hours to \u201cmake sense\u201d of her index finger, which no longer has padding. She called it a zombie finger. \u201cI was out of work for a week, and I type for a living,\u201d she said. \u201cI wound up using Siri to dictate most of my e-mails.\u201d         \n\nUpon returning from surgery, Ms. Schrag threw out the offensive tool, a gift from her grandmother \u2014 \u201cthough I should have kept it to ward off intruders\u201d \u2014 and replaced it with a KitchenAid stand mixer. \u201cI was like, \u2018I\u2019m not waiting for my wedding day,\u2019\u00a0\u201d she said.
