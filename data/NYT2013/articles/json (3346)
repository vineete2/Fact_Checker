{"headline": "Grind of Euro Crisis Wears Down Support for Union, Poll Finds", "body": "\nBRUSSELS \u2014 Europeans have never been wild about the  \n. With the region sapped by the euro crisis, confidence in the institution and the benefits it was supposed to provide is flagging faster and further than ever before, according to an influential opinion survey released Monday.         \n\nThe results of  \n by the  \n, a nonpartisan organization based in Washington, show a deepening disillusionment with the union in major member countries.         \n\nThe results of the survey suggest that more citizens than ever could end up opposing the transfer of more power to European Union institutions that may be vital for transforming the euro into a viable currency over the long term.         \n\n\u201cThe effort over the past half-century to create a more united Europe is now the principal casualty of the euro crisis,\u201d according to a report that Pew published with the survey results. The title of the report summed it up: \u201cThe New Sick Man of Europe: the European Union.\u201d         \n\nThe poll pointedly noted that, \u201cNo European country is becoming more dispirited and disillusioned faster than France.\u201d Last year, 60 percent of the French surveyed said they had a favorable impression of the European Union. This year only 41 percent did, a decline of 19 percentage points that was the biggest annual drop among the countries surveyed.         \n\nThe results corresponded to some degree to the health of a nation\u2019s economy. Only Greeks and Italians professed less belief in the benefits of economic union than the French, according to Pew. In Germany, 60 percent held a favorable impression of the union.         \n\nThat could have everything to do with the listless economy in France, which is on the verge of joining much of Southern Europe in recession and has an unemployment rate of 11 percent. The German economy has fared better and has a relatively low unemployment rate of 5.4 percent.         \n\n\u201cFrench and the Germans differ so greatly over the challenges facing their economies that they look as if they live on different continents, not within a single European market,\u201d the authors of the Pew report wrote. As a result, the \u201cFrench look less like Germans and a lot more like the Spanish, the Italians and the Greeks.\u201d         \n\nThe gloomy view is understandable given the economic crisis in Europe.         \n\n\u201cThe limits of the European Union institutional architecture are perceived more directly by the citizens now,\u201d said Enzo Moavero Milanesi, Italy\u2019s minister for European affairs, in an interview. \u201cThey have always been known, but citizens expected a more rapid and efficient response to the crisis and ended up complaining about the lengthy procedures, the many meetings, the difficult discussions.         \n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s a paradox,\u201d said Mr. Milanesi. \u201cThe E.U. has made great steps toward further integration and a strengthened monetary union. We even started discussing forms of possible political union, but people are still disappointed.\u201d         \n\nOne of the smallest declines in sentiment \u2014 two percentage points, to 43 percent \u2014 was in Britain. But the economic union has never been popular there.         \n\n\u201cWe should try and renegotiate our relationship with the European Union,\u201d said William Drake, co-founder of the investment advisory firm Lord North Street in London, expressing an opinion shared by many in his country. He added that many regulations were \u201cnot being properly discussed and debated by our own democratically elected Parliament. It sort of feels like we don\u2019t rule our own country anymore.\u201d         \n\nThe polls were conducted during March in Germany, Britain, France, Italy, Spain, Greece, Poland and the Czech Republic, by telephone or in person, with between 700 and 1,100 adults in each country. Each poll has a margin of sampling error of either three or four percentage points.         \n\nIn France, where voters eight years ago rejected a constitutional treaty meant to streamline decision-making in the European Union and lay out a blueprint for its future, 77 percent of Pew survey respondents said this year that European economic integration had made things worse for their country. That was an increase of 14 percentage points from the previous poll.
