{"headline": "Pakistani Militant, Price on Head, Lives in Open", "body": "\nLAHORE, Pakistan \u2014 Ten million dollars does not seem to buy much in this bustling Pakistani city. That is the sum the United States  \n for help in convicting  \n, perhaps the country\u2019s best-known jihadi leader. Yet Mr. Saeed lives an open, and apparently fearless, life in a middle-class neighborhood here.         \n\n\u201cI move about like an ordinary person \u2014 that\u2019s my style,\u201d said Mr. Saeed, a burly 64-year-old, reclining on a bolster as he ate a chicken supper. \u201cMy fate is in the hands of God, not America.\u201d         \n\nMr. Saeed is the founder, and is still widely believed to be the true leader, of  \n, the militant group that carried out the 2008 attacks in Mumbai, India, in which more than 160 people, including six Americans, were killed. The United Nations has placed him on a terrorist list and imposed sanctions on his group. But few believe he will face trial any time soon in a country that maintains a perilous ambiguity toward jihadi militancy, casting a benign eye on some groups, even as it battles others that attack the state.         \n\nMr. Saeed\u2019s very public life seems more than just an act of mocking defiance against the Obama administration and its bounty, analysts say. As American troops prepare to leave Afghanistan next door, Lashkar is at a crossroads, and its fighters\u2019 next move \u2014 whether to focus on fighting the West, disarm and enter the political process, or return to battle in Kashmir \u2014 will depend largely on Mr. Saeed.         \n\nAt his Lahore compound \u2014 a fortified house, office and mosque \u2014 Mr. Saeed is shielded not only by his supporters, burly men wielding Kalashnikovs outside his door, but also by the Pakistani state. On a recent evening, police officers screened visitors at a checkpoint near his house, while other officers patrolled an adjoining park, watching by floodlight for intruders.         \n\nHis security seemingly ensured, Mr. Saeed has over the past year addressed large public meetings and appeared on prime-time television, and is now even giving interviews to Western news media outlets he had previously eschewed.         \n\nHe says that he wants to correct \u201cmisperceptions.\u201d During an interview with The New York Times at his home last week, Mr. Saeed insisted that his name had been cleared by the Pakistani courts. \u201cWhy does the United States not respect our judicial system?\u201d he asked.         \n\nStill, he says he has nothing against Americans, and warmly described a visit he made to the United States in 1994, during which he spoke at Islamic centers in Houston, Chicago and Boston. \u201cAt that time, I liked it,\u201d he said with a wry smile.         \n\nDuring that stretch, his group was focused on attacking Indian soldiers in the disputed territory of Kashmir \u2014 the fight that led the military\u2019s Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate to help establish Lashkar-e-Taiba in 1989. But that battle died down over the past decade, and Lashkar began projecting itself through its charity wing, Jamaat-ud-Dawa, which runs a tightly organized network of hospitals and schools across Pakistan.         \n\nThe Mumbai attacks propelled Lashkar-e-Taiba to notoriety. But since then, Mr. Saeed\u2019s provocations toward India have been largely verbal. Last week he stirred anger there by suggesting that Bollywood\u2019s highest-paid actor, Shah Rukh Khan, a Muslim, should move to Pakistan. In the interview, he said he prized talking over fighting in Kashmir.         \n\n\u201cThe militant struggle helped grab the world\u2019s attention,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now the political movement is stronger, and it should be at the forefront of the struggle.\u201d         \n\nPakistan analysts caution that Mr. Saeed\u2019s new openness is no random occurrence, however. \u201cThis isn\u2019t out of the blue,\u201d said Shamila N. Chaudhary, a former Obama administration official and an analyst at the Eurasia Group, a consulting firm. \u201cThese guys don\u2019t start talking publicly just like that.\u201d         \n\nWhat it amounts to, however, may depend on events across the border in Afghanistan, where his group has been increasingly active in recent years. In public, Mr. Saeed has been a leading light in the Defense of Pakistan Council, a coalition of right-wing groups that lobbied against the reopening of NATO supply routes through Pakistan last year. More quietly, Lashkar fighters have joined the battle, attacking Western troops and Indian diplomatic facilities in Afghanistan, intelligence officials say.
