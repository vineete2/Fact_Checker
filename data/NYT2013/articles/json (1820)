{"headline": "From a Tortilla, the Feeling of a Warm Embrace", "body": "\nMy grandmother was working the day she met my grandfather on a garlic patch outside Mendota, Calif., in the flat fields of the San Joaquin Valley in the center of the state. It was 1942, and they were both 16. She liked to say \u2014 years later, standing in the kitchen of the house where she helped raise and feed us \u2014 that it was love at first smell. He was clipping garlic tops. She had just delivered lunch to some men in a nearby field.         \n\nThe Mexican farmworkers she cooked for were staying at her mother\u2019s boardinghouse on another ranch, and if they forgot their lunch bag or left before it was ready, my grandmother and her sisters drove out to the fields and handed it to them. In Fresno County, a golden, fertile kingdom bigger than Connecticut, this delivery system helped the family keep its word to the men. The boarders paid for housing and meals, whether those meals were eaten indoors or out.         \n\nMy grandmother, Ruth Velasquez Hernandez (whom everybody called Cuca), made tacos and burritos for them. Usually, they had two in their lunch, one with beans and cheese and the other with carne guisada, or meat in a spicy gravy. The masa pressed by her hands made the flour tortillas flattened by her hands for the tacos filled by her hands. Decades later, I probably walked by those anonymous farmworkers and their descendants at Fashion Fair Mall or Fresno State University. We had Cuca\u2019s tacos in common.         \n\nTacos are not a street food as much as a work food. They are the staple that sustains many of those who pick America\u2019s fruit and vegetables, clean its hotel rooms, build its houses and watch over its children. Tacos are cheap, versatile blank slates for any time of day, any upscale or modest taste, any stratum of society. But when I eat tacos I think of Cuca in the dirt and the sun.         \n\nSoon after they met in that garlic patch, my grandparents eloped (on their honeymoon, they picked grapes outside Fresno) and eventually ran their own business in the city, the San Joaquin Valley House-Moving Company. It specialized in moving not the furniture inside houses but the houses themselves, sometimes with the dishes still in the cupboards.         \n\nFor nearly 25 years, the company raised up people\u2019s homes, hitched them to trucks and delivered them to new ZIP codes in a gritty interplay of jacks, timbers, chains and amateur engineering, although each of my grandparents had only an eighth-grade education and one of their best workers happened to have only one arm.         \n\nCuca was the company\u2019s business manager, permit coordinator and predawn cook. A Baptist church once went on a 6-day, 17-mile journey from Selma to Fresno, and the men who lifted it, drove it and set it down nice and easy had Cuca\u2019s cooking in them.         \n\nPeople have been putting food inside tortillas and eating them for centuries, but the first tacos to be called tacos were probably eaten by 18th-century laborers working in the silver mines of Mexico, said Jos\u00e9 R. Ralat, an expert on the folklore of tacos, and the associate editor of the western-themed magazine  \n. The miners gave the food the same name as the little sticks of dynamite they used in their work.         \n\nCuca and the crew she fed were the distant American descendants of those miners. My grandmother was a Chicana, a California Mexican-American who was born in Fresno and straddled the three cultures of her state, her country and her heritage. She made tamales for Christmas but was a decades-long subscriber to Reader\u2019s Digest. She and my grandfather made menudo on Sundays, but also financed and managed a neighborhood baseball team. If there was a tangible link to Mexico in our lives, it was her food.         \n\nThe difference between her burritos and soft tacos was slight. Both were eaten rolled up, dynamite-stick-style, but one was folded at the ends and the other was not. She cooked the guisada, or the beans and cheese, and made the tortillas and slipped them between hand towels to keep them warm, but the rest was up to you. You could make yourself a taco or a burrito, or cover a plate with the meat and use ripped pieces of the tortilla as a fork.         \n\nShe never wrote down a recipe, and the secret of her cooking was not so much in the meat or the spices but in the tortillas. They were usually made fresh for every meal, regardless of the hour or the occasion: giant disks the size of dinner plates, thick and crisp and chewy, with charred patches from where the masa bubbled up on the griddle.         \n\nNot too long before they met in that garlic patch near Mendota, my grandfather was traveling with his mother and his brothers when they came upon a crossroads. They had been picking cotton but were migrating from one part of the valley to the other, their belongings in a trailer tied to the back of the car. They had stopped for gas, but my grandfather\u2019s mother, with no destination in mind, was undecided which way to go. She took off her shoe and threw it into the air. When it landed, it pointed west, toward Mendota and, beyond it, that garlic patch.         \n\nI often wondered if it was the shoe that brought Ruth and Ruben Hernandez together. Now that they are gone \u2014 she died in 2011 and he died last year, both at the age of 85 \u2014 I like to think it was something more divine. Or maybe it was the men working the fields. Maybe, in a small way, it was her tacos.
