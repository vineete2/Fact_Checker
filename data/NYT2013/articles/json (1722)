{"headline": "U.S. at Home vs. a Mexican Team That Has Lost Way", "body": "\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 It is natural for any team or competitive individual to keep tabs on a rival, and the players on the United States men\u2019s soccer team, which traveled here this weekend hoping to secure passage to the 2014 World Cup, could not claim to be different.         \n\n\u201cAlways, the first question we ask is, \u2018How did Mexico do?\u2019\u00a0\u201d goalkeeper Tim Howard said. Time and again this year, the answer has been a compelling one: not well.         \n\nMexico has watched its world ranking drop five spots since 2012 \u2014 to No. 20 from No. 15 \u2014 and has limped into a tenuous fourth-place position in the region\u2019s current World Cup qualifying tournament. The team\u2019s most recent misstep occurred Friday, when it lost to Honduras at home, leading hours later to the dismissal of Coach Jos\u00e9 Manuel de la Torre.         \n\nThe Americans, all the while, have paid close attention, and Mexico\u2019s struggles represented a fascinating story line as the rivalry was set to resume Tuesday at Columbus Crew Stadium.         \n\n\u201cYou notice that things aren\u2019t going the way the usually do,\u201d midfielder Kyle Beckerman said. \u201cThey had a really good run in years past. They won the Olympics. It seemed like they were winning everything.\u201d         \n\nNot anymore, Beckerman said. Mexico won the 2009 and 2011 Gold Cup titles. Mexico then sent a young, exciting squad to the 2012 Olympics, and it won the gold medal. The expectation until this year was that the new generation would filter into the senior squad, spurring an idyllic era.         \n\nInstead, the team under de la Torre festered. Key players like Giovani dos Santos, Pablo Barrera and Javier Hern\u00e1ndez were getting inconsistent playing time on their club teams, and their individual form suffered. De la Torre, for his part, was criticized for being too conservative, particularly in home games, and he seemed at times to be too loyal to established players. Through seven qualifying matches this year, Mexico has gone 1-1-5.         \n\nIt all has led to panic and anger within the fan base at home and sudden instability inside the locker room.         \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re down now, so hopefully, we can keep them there,\u201d Beckerman said.         \n\nThe Americans have an opportunity to do it Tuesday night, and they may like their chances. To start, Crew Stadium over the years has become a de facto home to the national team, given the comforting vibe and positive results found there.         \n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s because it\u2019s in Middle America, whether it\u2019s because the one stadium where we kind of have a pro-American crowd, this is the one place where we carry that psychological edge,\u201d said Frankie Hejduk, a former United States national team player.         \n\nHejduk, who played in the 1998 and 2002 World Cups, recalled being on the bench Feb. 28, 2001, before the first qualifier the Americans played against Mexico at Crew Stadium. The temperature dropped to 29 degrees that night, and Mexico elected not to warm up on the field.         \n\nThe Americans, Hejduk said, latched onto this as a sign of weakness and went on to win that game, 2-0. They then replicated that result against Mexico at the same locale during the next two World Cup qualifying cycles.         \n\n\u201cAnytime you beat a team three times in a row \u2014 2-0, 2-0, 2-0 \u2014 that\u2019s a psychological edge,\u201d Hejduk said.         \n\nA fourth victory here Tuesday and a win or tie from Honduras, which plays at home against Panama, would guarantee the United States a World Cup berth. It represents a mouthwatering prospect, but the overarching theme from the United States camp was that Mexico was to be respected despite their troubles.         \n\n\u201cWhen it comes to this game, we\u2019re fearful of what Mexico brings,\u201d Howard said. \u201cThey\u2019re a tough team no matter what anyone says about how they\u2019re playing at the moment or what they\u2019re going through.\u201d         \n\nHe added, \u201cThey\u2019re not going to be this wounded animal everyone thinks they are.\u201d         \n\nThey will be desperate, though. Mexico sits a point beneath third-place Honduras and 2 above Panama. The top three teams from Concacaf will earn an automatic berth, and the fourth-place team, rather forgivingly, will go to a two-game playoff against New Zealand.         \n\nUnited States Coach Jurgen Klinsmann warned on Monday about underestimating a team that has its back against the wall and offered a bold prediction about Mexico under the interim coach, Luis Fernando Tena, who was an assistant under de la Torre and led the 2012 Olympic squad as its coach.         \n\n\u201cMexico will go to the World Cup,\u201d Klinsmann said.         \n\nTena faced rigorous questioning from the Mexican news media\u00a0on Monday. He revealed, somewhat curiously, that he and the staff would step down after Tuesday\u2019s game if de la Torre advised him to. But he reiterated that everything \u2014 his own status, future roster moves and the team\u2019s tactics \u2014 would not be addressed until\u00a0Wednesday.         \n\n\u201cWhat matters is the result,\u201d Tena said. \u201cWhat we need is points. They say that all wounds are healed with points.\u201d         \n\nNOTES         \n\nThe United States Soccer Federation on Monday released internal video taken from their loss Friday night to Costa Rica that seems to show that the referees were duped when they issued defender Matt Besler a yellow card, one that ruled him out for the match Tuesday against Mexico. Costa Rica forward Joel Campbell, the footage showed, appeared to dive and feign injury on a noncontact play several yards from the game action, duping an assistant referee. Unhappy team officials alluded to the phantom foul Saturday but did not lodge a protest, citing confederation rules that make it almost impossible to have a card overturned.
