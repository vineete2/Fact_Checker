{"headline": "Kerry Tries to Reassure Mideast Allies on Iran", "body": "\nABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 Secretary of State John Kerry sought to reassure this Persian Gulf ally on Monday that negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program would not put its security at risk, and he pleaded with critics of a deal, notably Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, not to try to scuttle an accord before the details were hammered out.         \n\n\u201cThe time to oppose it is when you see what it is, not to oppose the effort to find out what is possible,\u201d Mr. Kerry said at a news conference after meeting with the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates, Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, and the foreign minister, Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan.         \n\n\u201cWe have a strong strategic relationship that has been built up over many years. It is also a friendship,\u201d Mr. Kerry said. \u201cThe United States will do nothing in negotiating with Iran that will change that relationship. I want to make that clear.\u201d         \n\nSheikh Abdullah, the foreign minister, said he believed differences between the United States and its allies in the Persian Gulf, over Iran as well as Syria, had been somewhat exaggerated.         \n\n\u201cThere might be a difference on opinion about some steps,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there are no differences about the comprehensive strategy in the region.\u201d         \n\nAddressing a report that French reservations had delayed a deal at the talks in Geneva, Mr. Kerry said that the major powers were united but the Iranian delegation had not been able to accept it.         \n\n\u201cThe French signed off on it, we signed off on it,\u201d Mr. Kerry said. \u201cThere was unity but Iran couldn\u2019t take it,\u201d he said.         \n\nSheikh Abdullah said he believed the United States and its partners had adequately consulted the United Arab Emirates about its negotiations with Iran. But he left little doubt that he would oppose any deal that would give it a right to enrich uranium.         \n\nCiting the nuclear agreement the United Arab Emirates has with the United States as model for other countries in the region, he said, \u201cWe have accepted not to enrich\u201d or to reprocess uranium.         \n\nNegotiations in Geneva with Iran faltered over the weekend, in large part over disputes over language that could have given Iran a right to enrich. But many experts say that such right will inevitably have to be part of a final agreement.         \n\nMr. Kerry\u2019s visit to the United Arab Emirates wrapped up a weeklong tour of the Middle East in which he spent a lot of time mollifying American allies about a potential deal with Iran. In Tel Aviv, he held a tense session with Mr. Netanyahu, who has mounted a fierce lobbying campaign against an agreement, saying it would be a \u201cdeal of the century\u201d for Iran.         \n\nIn Saudi Arabia, Mr. Kerry relayed an assurance from President Obama that the United States would defend its ally from external attack. And he said the administration would keep the Saudis updated on nuclear negotiations \u201cso there are no surprises.\u201d Both statements were unusual, given the decades of close cooperation between Washington and Riyadh.         \n\nSaudi officials have privately complained about the administration\u2019s reluctance to intervene more forcefully in Syria. And they are deeply concerned about an interim agreement with Iran, which could allow it to continue developing its nuclear program.
