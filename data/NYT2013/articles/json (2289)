{"headline": "With or Without Bailout, Cypriots Lose Trust in Banks", "body": "\nNICOSIA, Cyprus \u2014 With her wedding day three months away, Despina Charalambous is desperate to gain access to her savings, which have been frozen at the Bank of Cyprus for more than a week. She plans to take out all her money once the banks reopen, even though the new bailout plan for her country supposedly guarantees the safety of her deposits.         \n\n\u201cI have lost my trust in Bank of Cyprus and banks in general,\u201d Ms. Charalambous, 33, a biologist, said. She was still bitter that just last week the country\u2019s president was ready to skim money even from small savers like her to help secure a 10 billion euro, or $12.9 billion, lifeline to the nation\u2019s outsize banking industry.         \n\nMultiply Ms. Charalambous\u2019s concerns by tens of thousands of account holders in Cyprus, and it becomes apparent why many people here and abroad have a sneaking suspicion that European leaders, in scrambling to cobble together yet another solution on Sunday night to the Cyprus crisis, have come up with little more than a Band-Aid for what is likely to remain a gnawing wound.         \n\nStocks were down broadly in Europe on Monday, after the head of the Eurogroup, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, suggested that the idea of skimming savers\u2019 accounts to bail out banks could be considered a \u201ctemplate\u201d for other countries. The borrowing costs of the financially shaky Spain and Italy surged upward as the markets digested the Cyprus news \u2014 and the broader implications for the euro currency union.         \n\nWhile depositors with less than 100,000 euros in their accounts will be untouched, people with more money will take losses in a first for euro zone bailouts. More broadly, this is the first time a euro zone country is planning to block depositors from taking their money out of financial institutions in large amounts and moving it elsewhere.         \n\nIn recent decades, such measures, known as capital controls, have typically been confined to emerging countries, like Argentina, or authoritarian states like Iran. Now Cyprus, a longtime haven for rich people from around the world, is struggling to figure out how to prevent them from going elsewhere.         \n\n\u201cFor the first time, we have capital controls in the euro zone,\u201d said Nicolas V\u00e9ron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a policy research group in Brussels, and a visiting fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. \u201cThe next time there is a crisis somewhere else in the world, people will think of what happened in Cyprus and will try to get their money out much faster. These are the new rules of the game.\u201d         \n\nEven many ordinary savers like Ms. Charalambous will have to wait a little longer for their cash. Despite promises since last week that the country\u2019s banks would reopen on Tuesday, the government late on Monday ordered all of them, including the Bank of Cyprus and Laiki Bank \u2014 the nation\u2019s largest financial institutions, with most of the accounts on the island \u2014 to stay shut through at least Thursday. And automated cash withdrawals will be limited to 100 euros a day.         \n\nUnder the terms of the bailout, Laiki will be restructured, with its guaranteed deposits transferred to the Bank of Cyprus.         \n\nLocal bankers conceded that the country was ill-prepared to deal with carrying out capital controls. It had not, for example, determined what types of controls to put in place \u2014 whether restricting local transfers, or forcibly extending the maturity of term deposits, or even in extreme cases closing bank accounts.         \n\nBankers and lawyers still working on the bailout deal on Monday said a decision had not been reached on whether Cypriots with deposits under 100,000 euros would be able to walk into their local branches and transfer their deposits to another, safer bank on the island.         \n\n\u201cThey definitely will not be able to send their money overseas,\u201d said a person involved in the discussions who spoke anonymously because the person was not authorized to speak publicly. \u201cBut with regard to transferring them to another local bank, that has not been decided.\u201d         \n\nNo wonder Ms. Charalambous is edgy. \u201cYou just get the sense that they don\u2019t know what they are doing,\u201d she said.
