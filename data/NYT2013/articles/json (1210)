{"headline": "Ryan Wins Another Season as Jets Defeat Dolphins", "body": "\nMIAMI GARDENS, Fla. \u2014 Woody Johnson,  \n\u2019 owner, strode to the middle of a jubilant locker room late Sunday afternoon. The players gathered around. His voice raspy from cheering, Johnson praised them for their passion and their effort during a season that ended with a 20-7 victory against the  \n at Sun Life Stadium.         \n\nAs Johnson spoke, some players wondered if he had something else to tell them. He did:  \n, their coach, will return next season. The Jets mobbed Ryan, who turned emotional. They hugged him. They slapped his back and his shoulders and his hands. The veteran linebacker Calvin Pace, who has been one of Ryan\u2019s more outspoken supporters, said the joy he felt was comparable to the elation of the improbable playoff runs of 2009 and 2010.         \n\n\u201cYou\u2019d think we won the  \n,\u201d Geno Smith said.         \n\nFew N.F.L. coaches survive three consecutive nonwinning seasons without making the playoffs, but Ryan bucked the trend. Adored among his players, Ryan has repeated how he believes the Jets are trending upward, with a talented defensive front and a promising quarterback, and his bosses agree. Ryan was notified about an hour before kickoff by Johnson and General Manager John Idzik, who presented him with a game ball afterward.         \n\n\u201cSo that was good,\u201d Ryan said.         \n\nIt was an understated response from one of the N.F.L.\u2019s iconoclasts, a coach who barged into New York five years ago with all the subtlety of a Hummer limo, guaranteeing Super Bowl victories and needling rivals and warning the rest of league that the Jets would be feared for years to come. He injected the Jets with energy and bravado and led them to two A.F.C. championship game appearances before presiding over a decline that, coupled with the logical notion that Idzik would be interested in hiring his own coach, created speculation that Sunday would be Ryan\u2019s final game.         \n\n\u201cI always made the assumption we were together from the beginning,\u201d said Idzik, who inherited Ryan when he took over in January. \u201cI know that there\u2019s speculation throughout the season otherwise, but we always worked together.\u201d Of Ryan, he added: \u201cHe\u2019s been tremendous to work with. He\u2019s a leader, he\u2019s a motivator, he\u2019s a teacher, he\u2019s a heck of a coach.\u201d         \n\nAfter Idzik arrived, Ryan toned down his bombast and revisited the approach he used in 2009, his first season, when he ran defensive meetings and called defensive plays. He coaxed eight victories out of a team in transition, with 11 new starters and an overhauled coaching staff that includes three different coordinators, and started rookies at quarterback and cornerback, positions where he believes teams lose games the fastest.         \n\nOn Sunday, the Jets won, savoring consecutive victories for the only time this season, in part because of contributions from those two spots. Smith completed 17 of 27 passes for 190 yards and, for the second consecutive week, ran for a touchdown and did not commit a turnover. Dee Milliner intercepted two Ryan Tannehill passes in the game\u2019s final 20 minutes, including one at the Jets\u2019 22 with Miami trailing, 14-7, late in the third quarter.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re clearly on the ascent,\u201d Johnson said, \u201cand a lot of it is due to our coach.\u201d         \n\nFour weeks ago, the Jets were embarrassed by Miami at MetLife Stadium, losing by 23-3 in a game that Ryan last week called \u201cthe low point\u201d of their season. He told his players that \u201cwe\u2019re here on a purpose to beat these dudes,\u201d that Sunday\u2019s game meant more than just a chance to end the Dolphins\u2019 playoff hopes. It would double as a gauge of their improvement, and so it did: The Jets held Miami scoreless over the final 41 minutes 51 seconds.         \n\n\u201cRex never gave up, and this team never gave up on him,\u201d receiver David Nelson said.         \n\nFiring Ryan would have been met with disapproval \u2014 if not an insurrection \u2014 in the locker room, where in recent weeks, players like Nelson, Willie Colon and Pace said it was imperative the Jets retain him.         \n\nJohnson would not say when the decision to retain Ryan was reached other than that he and Idzik made up their minds before these last two weeks. Nor would they discuss Ryan\u2019s contract situation, specifically whether he will play out the final year of his deal or if they intend to reward him with an extension. Anything less than a multiyear extension would create similar instability next season, with Ryan\u2019s job security becoming as much of a focal point as it was this year.         \n\nThat lack of certainty, in theory, could also make it harder for Ryan to assemble a coaching staff again \u2014 which he soon might have to do. Several members of his staff, including the defensive coordinator Dennis Thurman and the special-teams coordinator Ben Kotwica, are in the final years of their contracts.         \n\nBut Ryan\u2019s return seems to ensure that for the first the time in the last three off-seasons, the Jets will not be searching for an offensive coordinator. Smith can only benefit from the continuity afforded by another season under Marty Mornhinweg and, presumably, the quarterbacks coach David Lee. Since being benched for the second half in the loss to Miami, Smith has reduced his mistakes and demonstrated greater command of the offense.         \n\n\u201cIf we had five more games, it would be interesting,\u201d Pace said.         \n\nThey did not. They had only Sunday\u2019s, which they dominated for the final 40 minutes. About 45 minutes before it started, Ryan strode to the middle of the field. He had just finished shaking hands with every player during stretching, but now he was alone, no one within 5 yards. He leaned over and clapped twice.         \n\nMaybe that gesture meant nothing. Maybe Ryan was eager for Game 16. Or maybe he was still thinking about the news that had been delivered just minutes earlier, the only news he wanted to hear: that he will remain the Jets\u2019 coach, same as he ever was.
