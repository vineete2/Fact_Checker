{"headline": "Mayhem in Cairo as Morsi Backers Fight for Return", "body": "\nCAIRO \u2014 Egypt\u2019s bitter split over who should be ruling the country exploded into violent clashes in the streets of Cairo and elsewhere on Friday as masses of demonstrators celebrating the ouster of President Mohamed Morsi battled crowds of Islamists who wanted him reinstated.         \n\nCombatants used rocks, sticks, fireworks and Molotov cocktails in a battle lasting hours that raged near Tahrir Square and across a bridge spanning the Nile, part of the most widespread street violence in Egypt since the early days of the 2011 revolution.         \n\nThe mayhem capped a day full of massive and defiant protests by Islamists demanding that Mr. Morsi be returned to power. At least four people were killed and many were wounded when security forces fired into a protest near the officers\u2019 club of the powerful Republican Guard, where many believed Mr. Morsi was detained.         \n\nWith clashes breaking out late into the night, it was impossible to estimate the full extent of casualties and damage. But early Saturday, security officials said at least 30 people had been killed nationwide and hundreds wounded, many of them in Cairo.         \n\nIslamists in other cities across the country also demanded Mr. Morsi\u2019s reinstatement, breaking into government offices in several provinces and temporarily evicting military officials. Fifteen people died in Alexandria, and a curfew was declared in the Sinai Peninsula, where six soldiers and police officers were killed in at least four attacks on security posts.         \n\nThe new violence suggested that the military\u2019s removal of Mr. Morsi, the country\u2019s first freely elected president, after protests by millions of Egyptians angry with his rule, had worsened the deep polarization between Islamists who call his ouster a military coup and their opponents who say his removal was the result of an urgent need to fix Egypt\u2019s myriad problems.         \n\nBy turning out in the tens of thousands, the pro-Morsi crowds underlined the organizational might of the Muslim Brotherhood, which emerged as the major political force and dominated rounds of elections after the country\u2019s revolution two years ago. At that time, it gained power that many in the group had dreamed of for decades. The military\u2019s intervention in politics this week entirely removed it from the government.         \n\nThe group called the protests the \u201cFriday of Rejection\u201d and chanted for Mr. Morsi\u2019s return.         \n\n\u201cWe will bring him back bearing him on our necks, sacrifice our souls for him,\u201d Mohamed Badie, the group\u2019s spiritual leader, told an enraged crowd at a large demonstration in the Cairo suburb of Nasr City. \u201cWe will bring back the rights of the Egyptian people who were wronged by this disgraceful conspiracy.\u201d         \n\nMr. Badie said the reports that he had been among the Islamist leaders arrested in a post-Morsi crackdown by security forces were false. Hundreds of Islamists were detained within a day after Mr. Morsi\u2019s ouster. Some were released on Friday.         \n\nAn interim president installed by the military, Adli Mansour, a former chief justice of the Supreme Constitutional Court, took a further step on Friday to erase the vestiges of Mr. Morsi\u2019s government by formally dissolving the Shura Council, the country\u2019s only operating house of Parliament, which the Islamists had dominated. The constitutional court had disbanded the lower house last year, one of many challenges Mr. Morsi had faced in his troubled tenure.         \n\nIn a further affront to the Islamists, the Egyptian news media have marginalized their message in the two days since Mr. Morsi was deposed. Despite the interim government\u2019s pledge of inclusiveness, Islamist television broadcasters were shuttered, and the state television barely covered the breadth of the pro-Morsi demonstrations on Friday.         \n\nUnderpinning the Islamists\u2019 fears of the emerging political order was a keen awareness of the long history of enmity with the security services. While some Islamists did use violence against the state, Egypt\u2019s previous rulers kept even nonviolent Islamists in check by banning their organizations and subjecting them to arbitrary arrests and torture.         \n\nFor some, those memories have come flooding back.
