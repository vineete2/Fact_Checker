{"headline": "Lessons From the Yellowstone Fires of 1988", "body": "\nWhile even little children know that Smokey Bear can spot a fire before it starts to flame, whether to douse that fire or let it burn out on its own is hard for even the best trained grownups to get right.         \n\nEach strategy has its own peril.         \n\nIf some fires aren\u2019t permitted to burn in the wild, dry tinder builds on the forest floors, threatening damage on a much larger scale when there is a blaze.         \n\nBut if a forest fire goes uncontained for too long, it may grow beyond human control.         \n\nAfter a summer hiatus, the  \n is back with a look at the enormous Yellowstone fires of 1988 and the lessons learned from that era. The weekly series re-examines leading news stories of decades past and is part of a collaboration between The New York Times and Retro Report, a documentary news organization formed last year.         \n\nTwenty-five years ago this summer, public attention was riveted on Yellowstone National Park, as forest fires burned through nearly a third of the park. In June 1988 when lightning strikes set off the first fires, Robert Barbee, the Yellowstone park superintendent, was not worried about the fires; to him, it looked like the normal beginning of another fire season.         \n\nPark service policy since 1972 had been to allow naturally caused fires to burn out on their own. Officials had grown to trust computer models constructed from years of data that guided them on when to let natural fires go and when to put them out.         \n\nBut by mid-July of that dry summer, parks officials realized the fires would not burn out as the formulas had predicted and indeed were spreading at an astonishing rate.         \n\nBy July 27, fires had devoured nearly 100,000 acres \u2014 more than double the forest that had burned in Yellowstone in the previous 15 years.         \n\nFire lines were dug, backfires were set, and the forests were strafed with chemical retardant, and still the woods burned.         \n\nAt such times, when nature turns chaotic and terrifying, people look to their leaders, regardless of whether anything can be done. \u201cWhen a crisis gets big enough, the president of the United States has to show that he cares about it,\u201d Donald P. Hodel, a secretary of interior in the Reagan administration, recently told Retro Report. \u201cNow, I couldn\u2019t do anything about the fire. The president couldn\u2019t do anything about the fire. But if the president hadn\u2019t been briefed on it, it would\u2019ve been easy for his critics to say, well, he doesn\u2019t care about the fire. Well, it\u2019s not true. So there was a photo op.\u201d         \n\nReporters wanted to know why federal officials didn\u2019t take more forceful action. \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018Well, why don\u2019t you just put it out?'\u201d Mr. Barbee explained to a Retro reporter. \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you just stop the hurricane or the tornado? You don\u2019t just put it out.\u201d         \n\nEvery tragedy needs a bad guy and for this one, it was Mr. Barbee. \u201cSomeone has to be the target and specifically yours truly was the target,\u201d he said. \u201cI kept hoping maybe Qaddafi would do something outrageous but he didn\u2019t. So they all came to Yellowstone ...\u201d         \n\nAfter nearly three months, the fires ended as they had begun, with an act of nature.         \n\nIt snowed.         \n\n\u201cWhat an army of firefighters, hundreds of aircraft and $120 million couldn\u2019t do, a quarter-inch of snow did, on Sept. 11,\u201d is how the video sums things up.         \n\nWhile the computer models for managing forest fires have become more sophisticated with time, the challenges today are greater. In the West, to meet the demands of a growing population, builders clear large tracts of land and put up new subdivisions where there were once forests.         \n\nWhen fires start near developments, letting them burn out is not an option because there are lives and homes at stake. And that makes the work far riskier, which was painfully clear earlier this summer when the winds abruptly shifted and 19 elite firefighters died trying to control blazes near Yarnell, Ariz.         \n\nAnd on Aug. 17, in an eerie commemoration of Yellowstone\u2019s troubles,  \nnear Yosemite National Park. It has set more than 200,000 acres ablaze inside and to the west of the park and has been threatening San Francisco\u2019s water supply.         \n\nThis week\u2019s Retro Report is the ninth in this documentary project, which was started with a grant from Christopher Buck.  \n which has a staff of 12 journalists and 6 contributors led by Kyra Darnton, is a nonprofit video news organization that aims to provide a thoughtful counterweight to today\u2019s 24/7 news cycle.
