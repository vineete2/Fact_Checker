{"headline": "Multigenerational Households on the Upswing", "body": "\nThe kitchen of the Thomas house in Bay Ridge,  \n, exudes an air of cozy domesticity.         \n\nKhadija Benmakhlouf, wearing pink corduroys and a crimson shirt, is perched on a stool poring over her kindergarten math homework. Her grandmother, Tupper Thomas, who is curled up in a nearby armchair, offers encouraging shout-outs from the sidelines.         \n\nAround 5 o\u2019clock, Khadija\u2019s mother, Phaedra Thomas, bustles in from her job as a  \n with her son, Teddy, 3, whom she has picked up from day care. Within minutes the kitchen is flooded with an intoxicating aroma as lamb chops from the halal butcher down the street sizzle in the oven.         \n\nThe two women moved into the two-family house in February, dodging workers as their contractor, the  \n, transformed the century-old home into a dwelling suitable for a 21st-century family.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big believer in this sort of arrangement, maybe because it never happened for me when I was a parent,\u201d said Tupper Thomas, a longtime resident of Park Slope who retired three years ago from a three-decade career as the president of the  \n. \u201cI didn\u2019t have that mom person around.\u201d         \n\nWith several generations in residence, the Thomas household represents a housing model that social scientists are paying a lot of attention to these days, one that grows out of a phenomenon that economists call \u201cshrinking households\u201d or \u201cmissing households.\u201d The terms refer to an arrangement not uncommon today among some ethnic groups and viewed as an encouraging throwback to the way many families lived decades ago.         \n\nThe challenges of multigenerational families are considerable \u2014 witness the flood of recent books on how to navigate the situation \u2014 but the financial, practical and emotional benefits can be great.         \n\nThe impetus for the growing number of such households is the recession that started in late 2007, whose lingering effects persist. During tough economic times, economists say, fewer new households are created than would be expected, because people are more likely to double up than strike out on their own. Statistically, they go missing.         \n\nRecent college graduates moving back home \u2014 so-called boomerang kids \u2014 are only part of the story. Whether prompted by a lost job, a house foreclosed or a sinking pension, grown children and their elderly parents are increasingly coming together under a single roof. Census figures show an uptick in the number of multigenerational families in New York.         \n\nOne measure of the increase is the number of households in which someone 60 or older is identified as the parent of the head of the household. In these families, the assumption is that elderly parents are living with their grown children.         \n\nBetween the 2000 census and the 2009-2011 American Community Survey figures, the number of such households in New York increased by 5 percent. The increases are especially large in  \n (up 21 percent) and  \n (up 8 percent). Both boroughs have large numbers of two-family houses, often called mother-daughter homes, with an attached apartment on the side or in the basement.         \n\nAnd the New York numbers are reflected nationally. According to a 2011 report titled \u201cFamily Matters: Multigenerational Families in a Volatile Economy,\u201d published by  \n, an organization that supports this population, more than 51 million Americans \u2014 about one in six \u2014 lived in a multigenerational household. This number represents an increase of more than 10 percent since the recession began, the organization said.         \n\n\u201cOur report found that in 66 percent of the households, the current economic problems were the cause,\u201d said Donna Butts, the executive director of Generations United. \u201cBut while many families came together because of the economy, they stayed together by choice. People expect stress from this arrangement, but they don\u2019t expect the benefits. The downside is that our culture is so focused on independence that pushing against the culture is considered shameful. I tell them, wake up and smell the demographics.\u201d         \n\nThe Thomas family is a classic example.         \n\nAt the time they decided to live under a single roof, Tupper Thomas, 69, was living in a condo on Eastern Parkway, and her daughter, 37 and recently divorced, \nwas living in Bay Ridge. When the mother proposed that they take up joint residence in the neighborhood, her daughter\u2019s reaction was instantaneous: \u201cOh, my God, that would be fabulous! Are you serious?\u201d         \n\nTupper had proposed the idea, in part, because she was an ardent fan of the support system a multigenerational family could provide. \u201cAs a girl growing up in Minnesota,\u201d she said, \u201cmy grandmothers were part of the family. They were there when the kids came home from school.\u201d         \n\nTheir white house with red brick pillars, which cost $800,000, is, like its sisters on the block, a two-family structure. In warm weather the front porch is wreathed in purple wisteria.         \n\nThe first floor, with a separate door leading to Tupper\u2019s quarters, is the heart of the house, with a spacious open kitchen where the family eats most meals, and a living room that faces the tree-lined street. The second and third floors, home to Phaedra and her children, include a playroom, the communal washer-dryer and Phaedra\u2019s childhood bunk bed, dotted with her old glow-in-the-dark stickers.         \n\nThe neighborhood is ideal. Phaedra\u2019s former husband, Mohamed Benmakhlouf, with whom she shares custody of their children, is close by, as is his auto repair business,  \n.
