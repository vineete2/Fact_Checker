{"headline": "You Call That a Tomato?", "body": "\nIf you run out of things to talk about with friends, mention that you can\u2019t get a tomato that tastes like a tomato anymore. People\u2019s eyes will light up in recognition. They will tell you that they have been disappointed by tomatoes and tricked by tomatoes. Tomatoes at the supermarket look just like tomatoes \u2014 red, firm and juicy, and some even have little pieces of vine attached, a particularly authentic touch.         \n\nThe only thing they don\u2019t have is tomato flavor.         \n\nPerhaps, given all the genetic engineering going on with foods, someone in the not-too-distant future will isolate and replicate a tomato tastiness gene.         \n\nToday\u2019s Retro Report video uses the story of a genetically modified tomato to show how over the last two decades, the mass production process has become more oriented toward serving farmers, looking for bigger yields and easy transport, than toward serving the consumer.         \n\nIn 1994, Calgene, a California company, brought the first genetically engineered crop to market,  \n. The company\u2019s researchers were able to inhibit a gene that produces a protein that makes a tomato get squishy.         \n\nThis tomato caused an enormous media stir. \u201cThe tomato stays riper, longer than the nonengineered variety, and they  \n,\u201d Tom Brokaw told his nightly news viewers.         \n\nCompany officials said every tomato they could get to market was sold.         \n\nTo build public confidence, Calgene officials were open about the process. They voluntarily sought government approval, labeled the engineered tomatoes clearly and provided an 800 number for people with questions.         \n\nBut all that changed after Calgene was bought out by the much larger Monsanto, a leading producer of genetically engineered seed.         \n\nIn time, Monsanto shelved the Flavr Savr tomato, though today genetic modification is widespread. In the United States, 93 percent of soybeans and 88 percent of corn is genetically altered, and much of it ends up unlabeled in processed foods.         \n\nIndeed,  \n is awaiting government approval to be the first  \n to enter the food supply.         \n\nThere are no genetically engineered tomatoes on supermarket shelves anymore. As has been true for decades, most tomatoes are grown more for yield and easy transport than for taste.         \n\nA green tomato that\u2019s gassed to redden is hard as a rock, which is actually considered an asset. It will arrive on the supermarket shelf with no bruises.         \n\nAnd little taste. \n         \n\nThe report is the eighth in a weekly series that re-examines leading stories of decades past. The videos are typically 10 to 12 minutes long and are part of a collaboration between The New York Times and Retro Report, a documentary news organization formed last year.         \n\nThe online project was started with a grant from Christopher Buck. Retro Report, which has a staff of 12 journalists and six contributors, is a nonprofit video news organization that aims to provide a thoughtful counterweight to today\u2019s 24/7 news cycle.         \n\nRetro Report will be on hiatus for the next couple of months before returning to a weekly schedule.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/24/booming/you-call-that-a-tomato.html", "date": "2013-06-24", "description": "This Retro Report video looks at the genetically engineered Flavr Savr tomato, which failed in the market but paved the way for many other biotech crops."}
