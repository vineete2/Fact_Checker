{"headline": "From the Start, Signs of Trouble at Health Portal", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In March, Henry Chao, the chief digital architect for the Obama administration\u2019s new online insurance marketplace, told industry executives that he was deeply worried about the Web site\u2019s debut. \u201cLet\u2019s just make sure it\u2019s not a third-world experience,\u201d he told them.         \n\nTwo weeks after the rollout, few would say his hopes were realized.         \n\nFor the past 12 days, a system costing more than $400 million and billed as a one-stop click-and-go hub for citizens seeking health insurance has thwarted the efforts of millions to simply log in. The growing national outcry has deeply embarrassed the White House, which has refused to say how many people have enrolled through the federal exchange.         \n\nEven some supporters of the Affordable Care Act worry that the flaws in the system, if not quickly fixed, could threaten the fiscal health of the insurance initiative, which depends on throngs of customers to spread the risk and keep prices low.         \n\n\u201cThese are not glitches,\u201d said an insurance executive who has participated in many conference calls on the federal exchange. Like many people interviewed for this article, the executive spoke on the condition of anonymity, saying he did not wish to alienate the federal officials with whom he works. \u201cThe extent of the problems is pretty enormous. At the end of our calls, people say, \u2018It\u2019s awful, just awful.' \u201d         \n\nInterviews with two dozen contractors, current and former government officials, insurance executives and consumer advocates, as well as an examination of confidential administration documents, point to a series of missteps \u2014 financial, technical and managerial \u2014 that led to the troubles.         \n\nPolitics made things worse. To avoid giving ammunition to Republicans opposed to the project, the administration put off issuing several major rules until after last November\u2019s elections. The Republican-controlled House blocked funds. More than 30 states refused to set up their own exchanges, requiring the federal government to vastly expand its project in unexpected ways.         \n\nThe stakes rose even higher when Congressional opponents forced a government shutdown in the latest fight over the health care law, which will require most Americans to have health insurance. Administration officials dug in their heels, repeatedly insisting that the project was on track despite evidence to the contrary.         \n\nDr. Donald M. Berwick, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in 2010 and 2011, said the time and budgetary pressures were a constant worry. \u201cThe staff was heroic and dedicated, but we did not have enough money, and we all knew that,\u201d he said in an interview on Friday.         \n\nAdministration officials have said there is plenty of time to resolve the problems before the mid-December deadline to sign up for coverage that begins Jan. 1 and the March 31 deadline for coverage that starts later. A round-the-clock effort is under way, with the government leaning more heavily on the major contractors, including the United States subsidiary of the Montreal-based CGI Group and Booz Allen Hamilton.         \n\nOne person familiar with the system\u2019s development said that the project was now roughly 70 percent of the way toward operating properly, but that predictions varied on when the remaining 30 percent would be done. \u201cI\u2019ve heard as little as two weeks or as much as a couple of months,\u201d that person said. Others warned that the fixes themselves were creating new problems, and said that the full extent of the problems might not be known because so many consumers had been stymied at the first step in the application process.         \n\nConfidential progress reports from the Health and Human Services Department show that senior officials repeatedly expressed doubts that the computer systems for the federal exchange would be ready on time, blaming delayed regulations, a lack of resources and other factors.         \n\nDeadline after deadline was missed. The biggest contractor, CGI Federal, was awarded its $94 million contract in December 2011. But the government was so slow in issuing specifications that the firm did not start writing software code until this spring, according to people familiar with the process. As late as the last week of September, officials were still changing features of the Web site,  \n, and debating whether consumers should be required to register and create password-protected accounts before they could shop for health plans.
