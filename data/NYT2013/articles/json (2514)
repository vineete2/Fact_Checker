{"headline": "Catholic Push to Overhaul Immigration Goes to Pews", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Catholic bishops and priests from major dioceses across the country will preach a coordinated message next month backing changes in immigration policy, with some using Sunday Masses on Sept. 8 to urge Congressional passage of a legislative overhaul that includes a path to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants.         \n\nThe decision to embrace political action from the pulpit is part of a broader effort by the Roman Catholic Church and other faith groups that support President Obama\u2019s call for new immigration laws. It includes advertising and phone calls directed at 60 Catholic Republican lawmakers and \u201cprayerful marches\u201d in Congressional districts where the issue has become a divisive topic.         \n\n\u201cWe want to try to pull out all the stops,\u201d said Kevin Appleby, the director of migration policy at the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, who said the immigration issue was at a now-or-never moment. \u201cThey have to hear the message that we want this done, and if you\u2019re not successful during the summer, you\u2019re not going to win by the end of the year.\u201d         \n\nCatholic leaders, who have tried to wield their clout against Mr. Obama on issues like abortion, birth control and same-sex marriage, are betting that their congregations will be able to exert pressure on reluctant Republicans and wavering Democrats to support the president on immigration. They say they are motivated by the Bible\u2019s teachings and by the reality that many Latino immigrants are Catholics and represent a critical demographic for the church.         \n\nThe political campaign by Catholic priests is certain to catch the attention of Catholic members of Congress. Catholics are the largest single religious group in Congress, making up just over 30 percent of the members, according to the  \n. The current House has 136 Catholic members, including Speaker John A. Boehner and 60 other Republicans, according to Pew.         \n\nFor some Republican members, vocal support by local priests and bishops could provide the religious rationale they need to support an overhaul in the face of criticism from conservatives. \u201cThe connection between a pastor and their congregation is really like nothing else in society,\u201d said Ali Noorani, the executive director of the National Immigration Forum.         \n\nWhite House officials said they were counting on Catholics and members of other religious groups to help pass an immigration overhaul through a Republican-controlled House that is filled with members fighting against one. Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, the director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, said Catholic leaders had participated in outreach meetings at the White House.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty rare for the Catholics to take on an issue like this straight to the pews,\u201d said Ms. Mu\u00f1oz, who is leading Mr. Obama\u2019s immigration effort. She said Catholics had long been advocates for an immigration overhaul, but were now more organized. \u201cThis is actually a much more across-the-church effort, and it shows.\u201d         \n\nLast year, Catholic activism pushed Mr. Obama to compromise on a plan to require religious employers to provide contraception health coverage. The Catholic Church often plays an outsize role in the political debate over abortion and marriage. But it remains unclear how much the Catholic campaign on immigration can change the minds of lawmakers who view the president\u2019s proposals as amnesty for lawbreakers.         \n\nRepresentative Steve King, a Catholic Republican from Iowa and a leading opponent of the immigration overhaul, said the campaign may help persuade some colleagues who are already under political pressure to pass an immigration bill.         \n\n\u201cIf the church puts out a unified message, there will be some Catholic legislators who will want to accept that guidance, because they want to get there anyway,\u201d Mr. King said. \u201cIt gives them cover.\u201d         \n\nRepresentative Daniel Lipinski, a Catholic Democrat from Illinois, said he had listened to the bishops and priests from his district. But he said he viewed their opinions on immigration as less binding than the church\u2019s positions on social issues.         \n\n\u201cThere are some issues that the church speaks authoritatively on, such as abortion, in protecting life,\u201d said Mr. Lipinski, who remains skeptical about promises of increased border security. \u201cAnd then there are prudential judgments that are made, informed by Catholic theology, but it\u2019s not something that Catholics are required to follow.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/22/us/politics/catholic-leaders-to-take-immigration-push-to-the-pews.html", "date": "2013-08-21", "description": "Bishops and priests across the country will preach a coordinated message next month backing changes that include a path to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants."}
