{"headline": "The Softness, the Crunch, the Nostalgia of the Fish Taco", "body": "\nSome people get a faraway look in their eyes when they talk about fish tacos.         \n\nIn conversation with these people, all you have to do is call up a memory of the fish tacos that come from the Pacific Coast of Mexico \u2014 especially from Baja California, the rugged peninsula that juts southward into the sea like the spoke of a tuning fork \u2014 and it can send them into mists of nostalgic delirium.         \n\nThis is bound to happen with Richard Ampudia, a New York restaurateur who grew up in Mexico City and has been associated with Manhattan spots like  \n and  \n         \n\n\u201cFish tacos remind me of being young,\u201d Mr. Ampudia, 46, said (and nearly sighed) the other day.         \n\nIn his teenage years he took bus trips to remote areas of Mexico, slept in hammocks a few barefoot steps from the waves, drank beer and devoured tortillas filled with fried snapper or sea bass. In his adult years he became so obsessed with those beloved beach snacks that he made a series of visits back to his home country to research them. He wound up opening a restaurant in Brooklyn,  \n, which he conceived as a temple to their excellence.         \n\nCalifornia surfers and entrepreneurs became obsessed with them, too, and started carrying them north in the \u201cEndless Summer\u201d era. Fish-taco stands and chains can now be found all over the  \n, and gradually they are arriving in New York City, at spots like  \n and  \n.         \n\n\u201cI think fish tacos are one of the most perfect dishes,\u201d said the chef  \n         \n\nThat said, there are many different variations on the form, because there are many different regions of Mexico. The version that seems to resonate the most stirringly with fish-taco fanatics is the one that tastes as if it\u2019s two or three culinary steps removed from something you\u2019d buy (with a cup of tartar sauce) from a Kilkenny chip shop or a Cape Cod clam shack. Strips of fish are coated in beer batter, deep-fried then tucked into a soft tortilla with a tangle of green cabbage (not lettuce) and a smear of mayonnaise or crema, a Mexican spin on cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. A slice or two of avocado? Your call. Shavings of radish? Sure. Spoonfuls of tomato salsa? Probably a bad call.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you why: tomato has so much moisture that it weighs down the batter,\u201d said the New York-bred chef and Food Network star  \n \u201cThe only thing moist should really be the crema. I\u2019m a big fan of the slaw. I think it gives it texture and crunch. But I can do without avocado. I think that\u2019s a California thing. I mean, everybody wants to put avocado on everything in that state.\u201d         \n\nEven with avocado, true fish tacos are not necessarily a feast for the eyes. Whether you order them in a restaurant that knows what it\u2019s doing or fry them up at home, you\u2019ll wind up with a less-than-scintillating color scheme of tan-on-beige-on-greenish-white. Go with that. The appeal of a fish taco doesn\u2019t depend on what you see. In fact, it depends only partly on what you taste.         \n\n\u201cI would argue that the texture is just as important,\u201d said the chef Alex Stupak, who serves a fish tempura taco (with cabbage and lime mayonnaise) at  \n in the West Village. \u201cI believe that a fish taco is texturally epiphanal in the same way that eating perfectly crisp Peking duck skin is, folded into those little sort of crepes that they give you. It\u2019s the same concept. There\u2019s something about sinking your teeth into something soft, and then feeling a crunch, that is just magical.\u201d         \n\nObsession and storytelling are cousins, so it\u2019s probably no surprise that a few gastronomes with a fish-taco fix, including Mr. Ampudia, are drawn to a fascinating theory about the genesis of the dish. Their notion is that Japanese fishermen started working in and around Baja California before World War II and introduced the locals to tempura (which Japan had, centuries earlier, most likely picked up from  \n). Tempura found its way into tortillas.         \n\n\u201cAm I a forensic scientist of food?\u201d Mr. Ampudia said. \u201cI cannot prove it. A food historian might debate it. To me, it\u2019s an intuitive thing that I feel is very possible.\u201d         \n\n \n, the Southern California columnist and editor and the author of \u201cTaco U.S.A.,\u201d isn\u2019t buying it.         \n\n\u201cI would say that\u2019s absolutely false,\u201d he said. While it\u2019s not hard to draw a connection between Lebanese immigrants to Mexico and  \n, whose meat is sliced off a shawarma-style spit, Mr. Arellano suggested that the captivatingly multicultural idea that fish tacos could be traced back to Japan amounted to \u201ca convenient story.\u201d         \n\nMr. Stupak agreed, pretty much. And anyway, when the topic is fish tacos, his mind tends to wander in a different direction from culinary history.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even care where they come from,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re just awesome.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/02/dining/the-softness-the-crunch-the-nostalgia-of-the-fish-taco.html", "date": "2013-10-01", "description": "Fish tacos are a nearly perfect food, but hold the salsa.
