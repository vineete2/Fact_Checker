Lew and the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke \u2014 who were both at the I.M.F. meeting \u2014 on the issue, predicting that even a near-default would lead to higher borrowing costs and a slowdown of the global economy.         \n\n\u201cThis cannot happen, and this shall not happen,\u201d Baudouin Prot, chairman of the French bank BNP Paribas, said at a meeting of the Institute of International Finance also being held in Washington. \u201cThe consequences of this would be absolutely disastrous.\u201d         \n\nMr. Lew acknowledged the threat. \u201cOur work begins at home,\u201d he said. \u201cWe recognize that the United States is the anchor of the international financial system. With the deepest and most liquid financial markets, when risk rises, the flight to safety and to quality brings investors to U.S. markets. But the United States cannot take this hard-earned reputation for granted.\u201d         \n\nParticipants at the meetings remained on edge, given the gravity of the threat. Ms. Lagarde said \u201cthat lack of certainty, that lack of trust in the U.S. signature\u201d would disrupt the world economy.         \n\nWolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister, issued his own urgent appeal. \u201cThe fiscal standoff has to be resolved without delay,\u201d he said in a statement released by the I.M.F.         \n\nJamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, painted a bleak picture of the days ahead if there is no resolution.         \n\n\u201cAs you get closer to it, the panic will set in and something will happen,\u201d Mr. Dimon said at the international institute event. \u201cI don\u2019t personally know when that problem starts.\u201d         \n\nHe added that JPMorgan had been \u201cspending huge amounts of time and money and effort to be prepared.\u201d         \n\nMany of the high-ranking officials present in Washington for the meetings made open appeals to Congress, with warnings coming from many of Washington\u2019s allies and creditors. Ms. Lagarde\u2019s counterpart at the World Bank, the American physician Jim Yong Kim, said the world was \u201cdays away from a very dangerous moment.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThe closer we get to the deadline the greater the impact will be for the developing world,\u201d he said.         \n\nFahad Almubarak, governor of the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency, said \u201curgent political agreements on budget and debt issues are necessary to preserve and, indeed, reinforce the modest recovery.\u201d And Yi Gang, an official with China\u2019s central bank, said the fiscal uncertainties \u201cmust be addressed promptly.\u201d         \n\nConcern over the impasse has already led to a slide in stocks \u2014 including the worst two-day dip in months. American economic confidence has taken the worst hit since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. And investors have dumped certain short-term Treasury debt because of fears that the Treasury might not pay them back on time.         \n\nMarkets ended last week with a burst of optimism, after House Republicans took the first steps toward a compromise. But that optimism faded over the weekend. On Sunday, with negotiations in the Senate stalled, the value of the dollar was sliding. \u00a0         \n\nIn the Asia-Pacific region early Monday, stock markets moved lower in Singapore, Taiwan and Australia. Markets in Hong Kong and Japan were shut for holidays.         \n\nOn Monday, all eyes in the American and European markets will be focused on the negotiations in Congress. Big American companies will announce their quarterly results this week, normally a significant event for Wall Street. But that is likely to attract little attention until the political negotiations are settled.         \n\nThere has been much debate about how quickly problems will ripple through the economy before and after the deadline. The Treasury Department will continue to take in money and might be able to pay its bills for as long as two weeks. Some House Republicans have said that even if the Treasury misses some payments, it will have enough money to avoid defaulting on its debt, the most frightening outcome for financial markets.         \n\nThe I.M.F., which lends to governments that have trouble finding financing on the sovereign debt markets, said it had been planning for any market disruptions. Mr. Kim of the World Bank said that the United States\u2019 flirtation with default in 2011 raised borrowing costs for many poor countries.         \n\nMuch of the attention has been on the enormous outstanding pool of Treasury bonds and bills. Short-term government bills are used to grease the wheels for many financial transactions and provide a benchmark from which other assets are priced. If the value of that debt was suddenly drawn into question, markets could quickly seize up.         \n\nMoney market funds, the popular mutual funds that own large amounts of Treasury bills, have been selling those that are scheduled to pay out in late October and November.\u00a0         \n\nAnshu Jain, the co-chief executive of Deutsche Bank, said on the international institute panel that his executive team had been trying to make contingency plans in case of a default, but it had struggled to come up with measures that would significantly stem the losses.         \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to go into all of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis would be a very rapidly spreading fatal disease.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/14/us/warning-of-global-risk-leaders-urge-us-to-solve-its-debt-limit-crisis.html", "date": "2013-10-13", "description": "The fiscal problems of the United States dominated meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in Washington this weekend."}
