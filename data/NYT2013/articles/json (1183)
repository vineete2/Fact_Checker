{"headline": "Prosecutor Overseeing Turkish Graft Inquiry Is Removed From Case", "body": "\nISTANBUL \u2014 An Istanbul prosecutor who had been overseeing a sprawling corruption investigation of the prime minister\u2019s inner circle was removed from the case on Thursday, in a new sign of a profound power struggle over Turkey\u2019s judiciary and police forces.         \n\nThe prosecutor, Muammer Akkas, issued a condemnation of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s government, accusing it of interfering with the judiciary and preventing him from carrying out his work.         \n\nMr. Akkas said that the government had prevented the police forces from pursuing a new round of suspects in the widening inquiry. Among those suspects, according to several Turkish news media reports, is Mr. Erdogan\u2019s son, whose name was on a summons that was leaked to the press on Thursday evening.         \n\n\u201cThe judiciary has clearly been pressured,\u201d Mr. Akkas said in a written statement, charging his superiors with \u201ccommitting a crime\u201d for not carrying out arrest warrants, and saying that suspects had been allowed to \u201ctake precautions, flee and tamper with evidence.\u201d         \n\nOn Friday, a top Turkish court suspended an attempt by the government to funnel all corruption investigations through top police and judicial officials, The Associated Press reported. The High Administrative Court said it would suspend the rule while allowing more deliberations on the issue, a week after Turkey\u2019s bar association petitioned the court for its cancellation, according to The A.P.         \n\nSeparately, three members of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s Justice and Development Party, known by its Turkish initials A.K.P., resigned from the party, bring the total to six in the past week and indicating more dissension in its ranks.         \n\nThe military said in a statement on its website that it would not get involved in a political dispute, a declaration that seemed to be an affirmation of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s success over the years in banishing the military from politics. This is just the sort of crisis that would likely have already triggered the intervention of the military in the past, experts said. In a sense, the conflict amounts to a test of Turkey\u2019s ability to move through a massive political crisis without the military standing by as a guarantor of stability.         \n\nThe prosecutor\u2019s removal from the case came a day after  \n whose sons had been implicated. One of them, the environment and urban planning minister, Erdogan Bayraktar, broke precedent by calling for the prime minister to resign, too.         \n\nSoon afterward, Mr. Erdogan announced a broader overhaul of his cabinet. Though some of the moves had already been planned, so that certain ministers could run in mayoral elections in March, the shake-up was widely seen as an effort to install loyalists around him.         \n\nThe unfolding scandal has already done significant political damage to Mr. Erdogan, who has been in power for more than a decade and was widely considered a likely candidate in next summer\u2019s presidential election, which for the first time will be determined by a national vote.         \n\nThe corruption allegations are centered on claims of bribery involving vast real estate projects, many of them in Istanbul, that have become a hallmark of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s time in power. No one has been convicted, but several people, including two sons of government ministers, have been arrested, and one of the departing ministers on Wednesday said that the prime minister himself had been involved in the real estate deals facing scrutiny.         \n\nAs the crisis has deepened, Mr. Erdogan has taken to suggesting that the inquiry is a foreign plot, and in remarks published on Thursday he said that he believed that he was the ultimate target of the investigation.         \n\nMr. Erdogan told the daily newspaper Hurriyet that those who tried to embroil him in the investigation would be \u201cleft empty-handed.\u201d He made the comments to reporters on a plane as he returned from a visit to Pakistan on Tuesday.         \n\nAfter the prosecutor, Mr. Akkas, went public with his allegations of judicial interference, Istanbul\u2019s chief prosecutor, Turhan Colakkadi, made his own remarks, saying that Mr. Akkas had been removed because he had been leaking information to the news media.
