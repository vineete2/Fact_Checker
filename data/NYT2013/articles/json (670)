Jerry Brown is facing dire predictions about the future of the state\u2019s prison system, one of the largest in the nation.         \n\nA widespread inmate hunger strike in protest of California\u2019s policy of solitary confinement was approaching its second week on Sunday. The federal courts have demanded the release of nearly 10,000 inmates and the transfer of 2,600 others who are at risk of contracting a deadly disease in the state\u2019s overcrowded prisons.         \n\nState lawmakers have called for an investigation into a new report that nearly 150 women behind bars were coerced into being sterilized over the last decade. And last week, a federal judge ruled that prisoners were not receiving adequate medical care.         \n\n\u201cIt is like a tinderbox, and all you had to do is light a match,\u201d said Jules Lobel, the president of the  \n and the lead lawyer in a federal lawsuit over solitary confinement. \u201cThey see the state has shown no willingness to change, even when the high court orders it. They have decided to circle the wagons and keep the system that exists today as intact as possible.\u201d         \n\nIn many ways, California prison system officials have been among the most reluctant to adopt systemic changes, experts say, doing so only when forced by the federal courts. Even then, lawyers and advocates for prisoners say, the changes have come slowly and unevenly.         \n\nMr. Brown, a Democrat, has aggressively fought several federal court orders in the two years since the  \n that conditions and overcrowding in the system amounted to a violation of the Eighth Amendment \u2014 cruel and unusual punishment. Since then, federal judges overseeing the case have repeatedly declared that the state was not making changes quickly enough, and that conditions in the prisons remained appalling \u2014 that the state had been \u201cdeliberately indifferent.\u201d         \n\nThe judges have twice threatened to hold the governor in contempt if he does not comply with their order to release prisoners. Last week, Mr. Brown appealed to the Supreme Court to stop the order, arguing that the system had already improved drastically and that stopping the release of prisoners was essential for public safety.         \n\nThough the current hunger strike is focused on the state\u2019s solitary-confinement policy, which allows inmates with gang associations to be held in isolation cells for decades, advocates and lawyers for the prisoners say that the widespread participation is a clear sign that the inmates are increasingly infuriated by the conditions. Roughly 12,000 inmates went without state-issued meals for four consecutive days, down from 30,000 on the first day but more than double the number who took part in a similar strike two years ago.         \n\nLast month, a federal court order demanded that the state move from the Central Valley 2,600 inmates at risk of contracting  \n, or valley fever \u2014 a potentially lethal disease. The state had resisted the move, saying it could cause race riots in the prisons. California is also facing a separate federal lawsuit charging that it segregates prisoners by race.         \n\nState legislators called for an investigation last week after a news report that prison officials had pressured dozens of women to be sterilized in the last decade. And on Thursday, a federal judge ruled that the state was not providing adequate medical care for inmates \u2014 including basics like access to clean water.         \n\nJeffrey Beard, the state corrections commissioner, said that the hunger strike was simply a sign of how powerful the prison gangs are and dismissed the notion that it indicated deeper problems.         \n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t something that came from a bunch of other people. It is guided by a few gang leaders who have enormous control,\u201d Mr. Beard said. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity inmates will often take to raise concerns they have. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s unusual, and I don\u2019t think that it is part of a bigger issue.\u201d         \n\nMr. Beard and Governor Brown have repeatedly argued publicly that medical and mental health care in state prisons have greatly improved. They have also maintained that California is being held to an unfair standard on overcrowding because many prisons around the country double-bunk inmates.         \n\nThey have made those arguments in court, bringing in expert witnesses who have testified that the state is providing care deemed proper under the United States Constitution.
