{"headline": "Prosecutors Draw Fire for Sentences Called Harsh", "body": "\nFederal prosecutors in Baltimore offered Roy Lee Clay a stark choice.         \n\nHe could plead guilty to trafficking one kilogram of heroin, and they would recommend a sentence of 10 years. Or, if he asked for a trial, they would invoke his earlier drug convictions from 1993 and 2004 and, if found guilty, he would face an automatic sentence of life without parole.         \n\nMr. Clay, then 47, was one of the rare federal defendants to gamble on a trial, and it proved to be a disastrous decision. The jury convicted Mr. Clay and at his sentencing last August, Judge Catherine C. Blake, of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, lamented that the mandatory punishment of life without parole seemed  \n         \n\nWhile mandatory sentence laws have frustrated judges and defense lawyers for nearly three decades, calls to revise the laws have surged in the past year. Driven in part by budget concerns as the federal prison population continues to grow, proposals in Congress to restrict lengthy automatic sentences to drug-gang leaders, kingpins and violent offenders have won  \n In August, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr.  \n to avoid harsh charges for some lower-level drug defendants.         \n\nBut the outcry goes beyond mandatory sentences and three-strike laws. Using their discretionary power to apply lengthy \u201cenhancements\u201d on top of required terms, critics say, federal prosecutors are strong-arming defendants into pleading guilty and overpunishing those who do not \u2014 undermining the fairness and credibility of the justice system.         \n\n\u201cProsecutors routinely threaten ultraharsh, enhanced mandatory sentences that  \n \u2014 not even the prosecutors themselves \u2014 thinks are appropriate,\u201d said Judge John Gleeson, of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, in a  \n. The way prosecutors use this hammer, Judge Gleeson wrote, \u201ccoerces guilty pleas and produces sentences so excessively severe they take your breath away.\u201d         \n\nA new  \n by Human Rights Watch, in New York, is the first to quantify what some call the \u201ctrial penalty,\u201d the extra prison time that federal drug defendants get if they exercise their right to a trial and lose.         \n\nIn 2012, federal drug offenders convicted at trial received sentences averaging 16 years \u2014 triple the average of five years and four months for those who accepted a plea bargain, according to the report, published Thursday. The study also found that while the prior-conviction multipliers were applied to 24 percent of eligible defendants who pleaded guilty, they were applied to 72 percent of those going to trial.         \n\n\u201cThe punishment is supposed to be proportionate with the crime,\u201d said Jamie Fellner, a senior adviser to Human Rights Watch and author of the study. \u201cIf a prosecutor thought 10 years was sufficient, how come if you go to trial, now you\u2019re looking at life?\u201d         \n\nProsecutors respond that using leverage to obtain plea bargains with clearly guilty defendants is a sound way to conserve resources and obtain cooperation, and that the harsher sentences that defendants like Mr. Clay receive after a trial are consistent with the law.         \n\nThe result is that federal drug trials have become a rarity: 97 percent of defendants plead guilty.         \n\nUnder federal sentencing laws adopted in the 1980s, drug crimes may be subject to mandatory minimum sentences of five or 10 years depending on the quantities of drugs involved, which can be reached by adding up small amounts from several deals.         \n\nProsecutors not only decide what charges to bring, but also whether to officially make prior drug felonies a part of the sentencing \u2014 requiring, for example, a doubling of a 10-year sentence for one prior conviction and a life term, like Mr. Clay received, for two. (Enhancements for the presence of a gun in certain crimes, also applied at the discretion of prosecutors, can also add decades to sentences.)         \n\nMichael S. Nachmanoff, the chief federal public defender for the Eastern District of Virginia, said that the prospect of staggering penalties puts defense lawyers in the position of urging clients to consider a plea to avoid them, even if the lawyers see a chance of acquittal or reduced charges.         \n\n\u201cI tell people, \u2018If you think 10 years is too long to serve and the other option is to get 20, I want you to think, how would you feel nine years from now?\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201cThose aren\u2019t the options people should have.\u201d         \n\nAnother problem with the prior-felony and gun enhancements, critics say, is the arbitrary variation in their use. In a  \n in August, Judge Mark Bennett of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Iowa, in Sioux City, described a \u201cshocking, jaw-dropping disparity\u201d in use of the prior-conviction enhancements, with some prosecutors routinely invoking them and others rarely.         \n\nIn a  \n, Attorney General Holder called for \u201cfundamentally rethinking\u201d drug sentencing, saying that many \u201clow-level, nonviolent drug offenders\u201d should not be charged with \u201coffenses that impose draconian mandatory minimum sentences.\u201d         \n\nA Justice Department spokeswoman, Ellen Canale, said this week that the department \u201cseeks to ensure that these enhancements are reserved for serious, high-level or violent drug traffickers\u201d and \u201cagrees that the enhancements should not be used to coerce defendants.\u201d         \n\nMr. Holder also praised  \n that could make sentencing more flexible for lower-level offenders.  \n proposal, sponsored by Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, and Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, would give judges the power to waive mandatory minimums and enhancements. A  \n, sponsored by Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, and Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, would reduce the length of mandatory drug sentences.         \n\nBut some conservatives and legal experts remain opposed to any major changes in mandatory penalties.         \n\nWilliam G. Otis, an adjunct professor at the Georgetown University Law Center and a former federal prosecutor, said that the reason defendants were in a poor bargaining position was not a result of prosecutors\u2019 abuse, but because \u201cthere is solid proof they committed a crime.\u201d The fact that violent crime has declined significantly over the last 20 years means that the system is generally working well, he said.         \n\nMr. Clay, in a federal prison in Virginia, is appealing his conviction. His lawyer claimed that he had at worst a peripheral role in trafficking and said he had no history of violence.         \n\nBut the prosecution called Mr. Clay a  \n and defended the life term, calling him a \u201cclassic drug-dealing recidivist.\u201d         \n\nEdward Smith Jr., the defense lawyer, said that over his 40-year career he had taken on fewer and fewer federal cases because the odds had become so stacked against defendants.         \n\n\u201cI hated seeing all these people, especially young black men, going for such long prison sentences,\u201d he said. Criminals deserve to be punished, he said, but \u201cnot to have their lives thrown away and wasted.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/06/us/federal-prosecutors-assailed-in-outcry-over-sentencing.html", "date": "2013-12-05", "description": "Critics say prosecutors are using their discretionary power to strong-arm defendants into pleading guilty and over-punish those who do not."}
