{"headline": "Israeli Military Stalls a College Career", "body": "\nSOUTH ORANGE, N.J. \u2014 For months, Tom Maayan had been the focal point of an international tug of war, pitting the Israeli military against a major American university, while clouding what looked to be a bright basketball career. But when Maayan, a sophomore at  \n, returned to the bustling campus here Aug. 16, after five months of army service in Upper Galilee, the northern Israeli province where he was raised, it was with a sense of relief.         \n\nHe thought all that diplomatic jockeying was behind him. He believed that the army had granted him a temporary exemption, the kind bestowed on only a handful of exceptional athletes each year. He started at point guard in Seton Hall\u2019s first game of the season, on Nov. 2.         \n\nBut a winding and exhaustive ordeal was recently shaken off course again. According to an army spokesman, Maayan\u2019s exemption was for only 120 days, and he was never officially permitted to leave Israel. The military expects him to return by Jan. 2.         \n\nThe news was delivered to Maayan on Monday by his uncle David Fuchs, who flew to the United States to see what could be Maayan\u2019s final collegiate basketball games.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shock,\u201d Maayan said, standing alone outside the locker room after Seton Hall\u2019s 82-66 victory against Monmouth on Monday night.         \n\n\u201cTommy has been and will always be a beloved member of the Seton Hall community,\u201d Coach Kevin Willard said. \u201cWe will certainly miss him, and while we understand and respect his responsibility to serve his country, we are disappointed with the timing.\u201d         \n\nFor Fuchs, who lives in Israel and served as Maayan\u2019s legal guardian until he turned 18, the last 11 months have been replete with ceaseless negotiating, hand-wringing and pleading in the hopes of making Israel recognize Maayan, 20, as an ascendant basketball talent.         \n\nThat recognition might have allowed him to remain at Seton Hall, the only program that offered him a scholarship after a devastating knee injury in high school and one that expected to be competitive in the Big East conference with him.         \n\nBut, for a second time, Maayan\u2019s future is in limbo, held up by bureaucratic wrangling and an exemption in dispute. The army, according to Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, a spokesman, took issue with Maayan\u2019s decision to attend college in the United States before serving his required duty at age 18, accusing him of attempting to flee.         \n\nFuchs believes there to be government skepticism over the validity of Maayan\u2019s unusual back story: a Jewish player recruited by Seton Hall, given a scholarship and earning significant minutes for a top-tier program.         \n\n\u201cI told my family I feel like Forrest Gump, when he ran and nobody knew, \u2018Why are you running, Forrest?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Fuchs said. \u201cI\u2019m running into an ocean. Nobody understands me.\u201d         \n\nThe first time Fuchs explained to Maayan that he had to return to Israel was in March, hours after the end of his freshman season. Fuchs flew to New York to watch Seton Hall play in Madison Square Garden in the Big East tournament. At dinner at an Italian restaurant on March 13, shortly after the Pirates were knocked out by Syracuse, Fuchs informed Maayan he could not postpone enlistment any longer.         \n\nMaayan hurriedly packed his belongings for the flight to Tel Aviv. In a tearful goodbye inside his coach\u2019s office, Maayan believed that he had bid his surrogate basketball family adieu.         \n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think I would come back,\u201d Maayan said in an interview this month. \u201cI thought once I go home, it would be over for my college career.\u201d         \n\nMaayan understood the rules of conscription and his responsibility to Israel, where he has lived (besides a brief stay in Canada) since age 3. He said he had no thoughts of abandoning his duty.         \n\n\u201cTommy never wavered,\u201d Willard said.         \n\nBut emotionally and internally, Maayan had been a wreck since he first began receiving letters from the army to his dorm room in December. How could he just leave his teammates and coaches? How could he abandon his new home?         \n\nOnce Willard heard about the complication, he assigned Steve Sauers, then the program\u2019s director of basketball operations, to oversee the paperwork and phone relaying. Over the months, Sauers\u2019s folder for Maayan swelled. He learned quickly that bargaining with the army would not be simple.         \n\n\u201cWe knew, until we got him back, we had a long way to go,\u201d said Sauers, now an assistant at the University of California, Riverside.
