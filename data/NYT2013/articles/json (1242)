{"headline": "On Book-Tour Circuit, Sotomayor Sees a New Niche for a Justice", "body": "\nCHICAGO \u2014 At her Wednesday night book talk here, Justice  \n glided through her audience of 700, dispensing homespun wisdom through a cordless microphone, interrupted by impromptu applause.         \n\nWhen the moderator read a question from Tabbie Major, age 7, about which books Justice Sotomayor loved as a child, she found the girl, locked her in an embrace, held on while reminiscing about Nancy Drew mysteries and then called out for a photographer to capture the moment. No need: a good portion of the crowd was already snapping pictures.         \n\nWelcome to another night in the life of Sonia Sotomayor,  \n justice, current queen of the best-seller list and suddenly the nation\u2019s most high-profile Hispanic figure. She may be a relative newcomer to national life, plucked from circuit-court obscurity less than four years ago. But the release of her new memoir, \u201c \n,\u201d suggests that she has broader ambitions than her colleagues, to play a larger and more personal role on the public stage.         \n\nPrior generations of justices mostly hid behind their robes to preserve their authority, and some current members of the court seem more like legal technicians, dispassionately adjusting the law. Justice Sotomayor \u201cmakes it harder for the justices to appear neutral and detached, but that was always a fiction,\u201d said Geoffrey Stone, a law professor at the University of Chicago.         \n\nTo say that Justice Sotomayor is less cloistered than most of her predecessors and colleagues may be an understatement: among many other appearances to promote her book, she salsa-danced with the Univision anchor Jorge Ramos in her chambers.         \n\nOther justices draw large crowds (particularly Antonin Scalia, known for his cheerfully pugnacious pronouncements) and have written No. 1 best sellers (as Clarence Thomas did in 2007). But Justice Sotomayor\u2019s readings have the air of celebratory happenings, attended by entire families, people who left work early to line up for tickets and acolytes who quote her recent interviews from memory.         \n\nExcerpts from her book appeared in both People and People en Espa\u00f1ol magazines, and  \n events were scheduled around her book tour. On Jan. 20, she administered the oath of office to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. at the early hour of 8:15 a.m., rather than just before noon as guided by the Constitution, because Justice Sotomayor had to appear that afternoon at a Barnes & Noble in Manhattan.         \n\nIn a backstage interview at the library where she appeared here, Justice Sotomayor said that encouraging others through her personal story \u2014 the diabetic child of a poor, non-English-speaking alcoholic, the first Hispanic member of the Court \u2014 was an even more important contribution than her jurisprudence.         \n\n\u201cIt is my great hope that I\u2019ll be a great justice, and that I\u2019ll write opinions that will last the ages,\u201d she said as she signed her way through giant stalagmites of books. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t always happen. More importantly, it\u2019s only one measure of meaning in life. To me, the more important one is my values and my impact on people who feel inspired in any way by me.\u201d         \n\nServing as a role model \u201cis the most valuable thing I can do,\u201d she added.         \n\nThe cornerstone of her effort is her memoir, which she said she modeled after President Obama\u2019s \u201cDreams From My Father,\u201d the book that helped make him a national figure. Her book, written with the assistance of Zara Houshmand, a poet, and published simultaneously in English and Spanish, has won praise for its emotional pull.         \n\nJustice Sotomayor received a seven-figure advance for the book, and this coming Sunday it will appear atop the New York Times hardcover nonfiction best-seller list for the second straight week. Though her book has sold well by the standards of these dark days for hardcovers \u2014 36,000 copies as of last Wednesday, according to BookScan \u2014 if it is incorporated into school curriculums, she could recoup her advance and earn royalties for years. (Unlike some members of the court, she did not come to the job with a large fortune.)         \n\nJustice Sotomayor\u2019s memoir is unusually frank by the standards of what government officials typically write. She emphasizes the fear and shame she has often felt: as a young child, she once heard relatives say her parents\u2019 apartment was filthy. She began routinely scrubbing it so that no one could ever say that again.
