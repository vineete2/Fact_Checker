{"headline": "Economist Flees as Russia Aims Past Protesters", "body": "\nMOSCOW \u2014 A prominent, liberal-minded economist has fled Russia under pressure from government investigators, as the Kremlin\u2019s yearlong crackdown moves beyond protesters and their leaders to elite power brokers who are suspected of supporting them.         \n\nThe economist, Sergei Guriev, who wielded significant influence under the presidency of Dmitri A. Medvedev, has been questioned repeatedly in a case that stems from  \n of which he was a co-author that criticized the treatment of Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the imprisoned oil tycoon.         \n\nMr. Guriev\u2019s flight comes amid investigations that focus on Moscow insiders who, investigators believe, have offered support to the opposition movement.         \n\nBehind their suspicions lies an uncomfortable truth: Among the businessmen and technocrats who make up Moscow\u2019s ruling class are many who hold relatively liberal views, and who are uncomfortable with the repressive, conservative course Vladimir V. Putin has set since his return to the presidency. But they have felt safe, for the most part, until now.         \n\n\u201cThis means that no one has immunity,\u201d said Aleksei V. Makarkin, an analyst at Moscow\u2019s Center for Political Technologies. \u201cIf any representative of the elite enters into a relationship with the opposition, he takes a great risk.\u201d         \n\nMr. Guriev would not comment on his decision, and he has said he is vacationing with his wife and children in France. But a friend, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Mr. Guriev left Russia abruptly because \u201chad reason to believe he could be deprived of his freedom.\u201d         \n\nInvestigations have begun to scrutinize government insiders, including officials who fell into Mr. Medvedev\u2019s liberal-leaning camp. Notably, investigators opened a criminal case against a top official at the  \n, the state-financed innovation hub that was Mr. Medvedev\u2019s trademark project, claiming the payment of hefty speaker\u2019s fees to the opposition leader Ilya V. Ponomarev.         \n\nOne of the few political heavyweights affiliated with Mr. Medvedev, the deputy prime minister Vladislav Y. Surkov,  \n after publicly criticizing the investigation, amid reports he was forced out. Officials, speaking anonymously, told journalists that Mr. Surkov \u2014 who once called the anti-Putin protesters \u201cthe best part of our society\u201d \u2014 was himself funneling money to opposition groups.         \n\nMr. Guriev, the rector of the New Economic School, seemed untouchable until recently. He wrote speeches for Mr. Medvedev, sat on numerous advisory bodies and served on the boards of state companies. When President Obama visited Moscow in 2009, he chose Mr. Guriev\u2019s university as the site for  \n.         \n\nA centrist figure, on good terms with most of Moscow\u2019s power brokers, Mr. Guriev took the unusual step last May of contributing 10,000 rubles, or around $320, to a fund supporting the anticorruption efforts of  \n, an opposition leader.         \n\nIn an essay about the decision, he said he did it because he believes Russia needs more political competition.         \n\n\u201cAm I not afraid?\u201d he wrote \u201cNo. I am a free person. I know that as long as I haven\u2019t violated the law, no one can forbid me to say something or do something. Might I be misled? Of course.\u201d         \n\nSince then, Mr. Guriev has been questioned repeatedly in a case stemming from the 2011 report on Mr. Khodorkovsky\u2019s case. Investigators have scrutinized several experts, contending they had received money a decade ago from a fund linked to Yukos, Mr. Khodorkovsky\u2019s company.         \n\nMr. Guriev\u2019s friend, who spoke anonymously because he was not authorized to comment on the case, said that after the most recent round of questioning, Mr. Guriev \u201casked a number of influential people in Moscow who normally would protect him, and he was given advice that he was not safe.\u201d The friend added, \u201cHe left in a hurry, we\u2019re talking about a few days.\u201d         \n\nAnother friend and colleague, the Pennsylvania State University economist Barry W. Ickes, cast Mr. Guriev\u2019s decision as the result of a long deliberation. \u201cIt came to a point where he had to make a decision, because he was in limbo,\u201d he said.         \n\nDmitri S. Peskov, a spokesman for Mr. Putin, said that as far as he knew, Mr. Guriev had simply left Russia on vacation, and that he could not comment on the investigation. \u201cThis is not our question. This has nothing to do with the Kremlin, nothing to do with the president,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only thing I can tell you is that this is pure speculation.\u201d         \n\nCommenting on Mr. Guriev\u2019s case on Wednesday, the pro-Kremlin analyst Sergei A. Markov wrote that institutions like Skolkovo and the New Economic School had been used to funnel funds to demonstrators.         \n\n\u201cThe sudden departure of Guriev is connected to the attempt to keep out of the hands of investigators these secret channels, through which oligarchic and federal budgetary funds went to support the revolutionary anti-Putin opposition,\u201d Mr. Markov said. \u201cThe goal was, of course, not direct revolution, but for Putin to give up his intentions to return for a third term.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/30/world/europe/economist-sergei-guriev-leaves-russia-abruptly.html", "date": "2013-05-29", "description": "Sergei Guriev was a co-author of a report that criticized the treatment of an imprisoned oil tycoon."}
