{"headline": "The Royal Family on Twitter: Approved Disclosure, in Short Bursts", "body": "\nLONDON \u2014 To follow  \n\u2019s royal family on its  \n  \n is to enter a universe that Shakespeare, with his battle-scarred kings and anguished princes, would not recognize.         \n\nIn this more genteel world, the Duke of Edinburgh will visit two youth clubs and  \n will meet representatives of the Youth Hostel Association in East Sussex; the Earl of Wessex, an honorary liveryman in the Worshipful Company of Haberdashers, will attend a meeting in the Haberdashers\u2019 Hall in the Smithfield district.         \n\nNo Elsinores here.         \n\nBut there is a point to it. In her six decades on the throne, the queen has navigated a subtle and sometimes stormy course between sanitized glimpses of her regal persona, and the privacy that preserves the mystique of royalty.         \n\nAnd, in a way, social media offers the perfect extension of those well-practiced ways, compressing the flow of approved disclosure into 140-character bursts, suggesting an endless loop of commitment to the family\u2019s subjects, be they youth hostelers or haberdashers or, as on Tuesday, members of the Ebony Horse Club in Brixton, where disadvantaged children get to enjoy the same equestrian pursuits as the royal family does.         \n\nWhen it comes to reinvention, in other words, the House of Windsor is no laggard, even if its rumpuses do not always shoehorn so easily into Twitter\u2019s brief confines.         \n\nPrince William, second in line to the throne and son of Diana, Princess of Wales, seems bent on ring-fencing his family\u2019s privacy in a way his mother\u2019s was not. His younger brother, Prince Harry, by contrast, has strayed often into the harsh glare of tabloid headlines, despite efforts by royal spin doctors to divert attention to his charity work for veterans and his combat role aboard attack helicopters in Afghanistan.         \n\nBut none has seemed so difficult to pigeonhole as their father, Prince Charles, the first in line to the throne, approaching his 65th birthday on Nov. 14 as an enigmatic heir with an agenda that sometimes seems to set him apart \u2014 and a doughty, 87-year-old mother who has shown no evident desire to relinquish royalty\u2019s top job beyond a modest slowing of her public engagements.         \n\nIn recent times, Charles has seemed to step forward in a variety of ways, chiding pension funds over the short-term flaws of \u201cquarterly capitalism,\u201d riling lawmakers with his perceived readiness to ignore constitutional restraints on political interference and parrying legislators\u2019 questions about his annual $28 million income from a property empire valued at more than $1.2 billion.         \n\nMost recently, he appeared on  \n after giving a journalist access to him and his aides.         \n\n\u201cFar from itching to assume the crown,\u201d the journalist, Catherine Mayer, concluded, \u201che is already feeling its weight and worrying about its impact on the job he has long been doing\u201d as the patron of many charities.         \n\nBy evoking the succession, the article also inspired some musing on the prince\u2019s public visage. As an activist, he took up ecological issues long before they became a global orthodoxy. As a husband, he harvested much of the opprobrium that flowed from his break-up with Diana and his subsequent marriage to Camilla Parker-Bowles, now the Duchess of Cornwall.         \n\nWhile he has championed the children of the poor through his charitable  \n, he stands \u2014 along with the rest of the senior royal family \u2014 as an exemplar of inherited privilege and enormous wealth. In matters of religion, he has said he would eschew the title \u201cdefender of the faith\u201d \u2014 meaning the Anglican Communion \u2014 in favor of the more inclusive \u201cdefender of faith.\u201d His potential subjects of all shadings remain undecided about whether he should cede the succession to William.         \n\n\u201cIs it because we have come to regard him as a figure of pathos and sympathy, a lifelong Nearly Man, an apprentice who never got the job?\u201d one newspaper, The Independent, said in  \n last year.         \n\nIn the era of social media, moreover, the royals face other contenders for public regard. True, their subjects number tens of millions. But in the Tweetocracy, two royal accounts boast around one million followers between them. The figure for  \n, a soccer player, is nearly 7.5 million.
