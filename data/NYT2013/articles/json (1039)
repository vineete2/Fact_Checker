{"headline": "More Retailers See Haggling as a Price of Doing Business", "body": "\nPay no attention to the price on that tag.         \n\nOr even the markdown.         \n\nThis year some shoppers are quietly taking the art of bargaining up the escalator to the floors selling cashmere or over-the-knee leather boots, building on the haggling skills they acquired in the last few years getting big-box store deals on TVs and the like.         \n\nArmed with increasingly sophisticated price-tracking tools on their smartphones and other devices, consumers have become bolder, and they know that they often have the upper hand during a tough season for retailers. Recognizing the new reality, some retailers, desperate for sales and customer loyalty, have begun training their employees in the art of bargaining with customers.         \n\nLast month, Best Buy essentially invited consumers to bargain when it announced that it would match the prices of any competitor this holiday season if customers showed proof of the lower price.         \n\nBut other retailers are doing the same with less fanfare, or even making steeper concessions.  \n, a new website that collects, compares and ranks online deals from thousands of retail brands, discovered that at least 20 percent of big-box retailers had price-matching policies, though many do not advertise them.         \n\nThe site\u2019s co-founders, Brandon Hunt and Cory O\u2019Daniel, said that they had been surprised to find that at least a half-dozen merchants \u2014 including some of the original haggling stages like Best Buy, Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s \u2014 now let managers go a step better and offer 10 percent below a competitor\u2019s price.         \n\nThe bargaining practices are more commonplace for home and sporting goods or electronics, but even higher-end retailers like Nordstrom have price-matching guidelines \u2014 though they usually do not broadcast the terms.         \n\nJoe Marrapodi, one of the founders and the chief executive of  \n, a new name-your-own price website, walked into Nordstrom and Bloomingdale\u2019s the other day in Santa Monica, Calif., and without identifying himself or his occupation, casually asked employees if they were open to bargaining. Both the sales representatives and the managers said yes without hesitation, he said, and cited specific price-matching policies.         \n\n\u201cI think they kind of keep it low key,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want it to be a thing.\u201d         \n\nA spokeswoman for Nordstrom said in a statement, \u201cFor as long as we\u2019ve been in business we\u2019ve been committed to offering our customers the best possible prices, including meeting competitor pricing on similar items.\u201d         \n\nThere was recognition among guests at a private round-table dinner with retail executives in Dallas that their stores had better accept regular give-and-take with customers, according to Alison Kenny Paul, vice chairwoman and leader of United States retail and distribution at Deloitte. \u201cSome talked about their epiphanies and said the world has changed, we really have to do this,\u201d she said.         \n\nAs a result, Ms. Paul said, some retailers are training employees on the rules of bargaining. Instead of price discounts, those deals may be add-ons, like an extended warranty, free delivery or free installation.         \n\nWhile it is mainly department or floor managers who are given the authority to make deals, other employees are now being coached to \u201crecognize when a consumer needs to negotiate,\u201d and to \u201cspot the consumer\u201d getting ready to walk out the door, she said.         \n\nWhen a sales clerk at Kohl\u2019s in Kennewick, Wash., recently asked Siobhan Shaw, who was buying an armload of items from the sale rack, if she would like to open a store credit card, Ms. Shaw recalled that she replied firmly: \u201cNo.\u201d         \n\n\u201cBut,\u201d she said she quickly asked, \u201ccan I get the same discount she got?\u201d She was referring to the woman ahead of her in line, who had asked for a discount and received 15 percent off. The answer was yes.         \n\nRetailers panicked a few years ago when they realized that some consumers were using brick-and-mortar stores to view products, only to walk out and order them at a lower price online. Now, Ms. Paul said, they are trying to \u201cturn lemons into lemonade\u201d by using that model as an opportunity to work with customers and even cement their loyalty.
