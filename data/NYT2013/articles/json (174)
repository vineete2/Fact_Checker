{"headline": "Billy Joel on Not Working and Not Giving Up Drinking", "body": "\n \n hasn\u2019t put out an album of new songs in decades, but the last few years have brought about a burnishing of his musical legacy. Most recently, he stole the show at the  \n, no trifling feat considering he shared the stage with the Who, the Rolling Stones and Paul McCartney. His set, characterized by remarkably robust vocals and a tight backing band, allowed songs like \u201cOnly the Good Die Young\u201d and \u201cYou May Be Right\u201d to be considered anew; the passage of time has cleansed the songs of any of the annoyance-factor wrought by FM overplay. A generation who never appreciated him, who judged him uncool, are now at the age at which they might actually suffer one of those heart attack-ack-ack-ack-ack-acks of \u201cMovin\u2019 Out (Anthony\u2019s Song).\u201d Even the haters, grown up now, would have a hard time continuing to begrudge Joel his mastery of songwriting.         \n\nSo he doesn\u2019t write anymore, not pop songs anyway. Instead he goes about his relatively ordinary life in plain sight in a cedar shake house in the middle of Sag Harbor village. He has a few of his vintage motorcycles in the garage, and his boat slip is within walking distance. He is seemingly never alone, spending his time in the company of his two pugs or his live-in girlfriend of three years, Alexis Roderick, a former Morgan Stanley risk officer (who he probably wishes had been alongside him in the 1970s to assess his first record deal). What he lacks in output, he more than makes up for in opinions \u2014 about his legacy, his mistakes, a rock-star life lived hard and the heroes and villains he met along the way. If the new music of many of his contemporaries is any measure, prolificness is an overrated quality. Once a pop genius, always a pop genius. We ought to know by now.         \n\n \nYou\u2019re by no means a fogy, but you\u2019re 64 now. When you look at other rockers your age, how do you think you\u2019re faring? Are there other guys whom you look at and think, There but for the grace of God?         \n\n \n It was funny, because backstage at the 12-12-12 concert, nobody is a spring chicken anymore. Here comes Keith, and Keith is from the time of King Tut. Then there\u2019s Pete Townshend and Mick and McCartney. Rocking-chair rockers. Bon Jovi is next door to me, and then Bruce is down the hall, and we kind of felt like the youngsters. But everybody is still doing it much older than I thought we would ever be. I thought there was a mandatory retirement age at 40, but then the Stones broke that barrier. Now Bruce and I are in our 60s, and the older guys are in their 70s.         \n\n \n You had a double-hip replacement two years ago. I was watching old clips of you doing these jet\u00e9s across the stage in the \u201980s. Do you think your hip problems were from years of stage work?         \n\n \n I was probably born with dysplasia. In the old days, when they took a baby out, sometimes they used forceps. I was a breech baby, so the theory was that they displaced my hips. Over the years, jumping off the piano, landing on a hard stage certainly didn\u2019t help. Way back in the early \u201970s, I used to do somersaults, flips off the piano. I would climb up the cables and hang upside down, anything to get attention. When you\u2019re an opening act, you gotta do whatever you can. But over the years it got excruciating. I couldn\u2019t walk at one point; I had one of those little scooter chairs, banging into furniture. By the time I finished the tour with Elton in March 2010, I was in a lot of pain, and over that year it got worse and worse and worse. I\u2019m glad I did the surgery, because my life changed. I\u2019m able to be ambulatory again.         \n\n \n Did you have any ambivalence about touring with Elton? You were kind of pigeonholed as a pop star who plays piano the same way that he was.         \n\n \n No. That was when I first started out. Elton was already established, and I came a few years after him, so there were inevitable comparisons. There weren\u2019t that many piano players around \u2014 Leon Russell, me, Lee Michaels, one or two other guys. I met Elton in the \u201970s in Amsterdam, and it was a mutual-admiration society: he liked me, I liked him and said some day we should tour together. It was left on the back burner for a good 20 years, and then one day I just said: \u201cWhy don\u2019t we do this thing with Elton? It should be fun.\u201d And it was, and we did it for 16 years. There\u2019s going to be comparisons \u2014 \u201cOh, who\u2019s better, Elton or Billy?\u201d Who cares?         \n\n \n Are you cool with Elton now? Basically he said that you\u2019re not writing new songs out of fear or laziness.
