{"headline": "Council Reverses Bloomberg Veto of Policing Bills", "body": "\nThe City Council voted Thursday to greatly increase oversight of the New York Police Department and of its widespread use of stop-and-frisk tactics.         \n\nComing after historic crime declines stretching 20 years and aimed at a police force whose tactics long enjoyed strong support in City Hall and among many New Yorkers, the move on two bills marked a decisive swing of the pendulum toward reining in the practices of officers and the policies of their leaders.         \n\nThe votes, a week and a half after a federal judge ruled aspects of police stops in the city unconstitutional, amounted to a stinging personal defeat for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. He has considered the policy to be central to one of his main achievements: a city safer than many hardened residents had thought possible.         \n\nThe two bills, which the mayor had vetoed and will now become law, represented an effort by frustrated elected officials to force changes on the police from the outside \u2014 one through an outside inspector general with subpoena power to study and make policy recommendations to the department; and the other by opening state courts up to individual claims of bias-based policing and by expanding the categories of people entitled to sue.         \n\nMr. Bloomberg immediately denounced the new laws as an effort to \u201coutsource management of the N.Y.P.D. to unaccountable officials,\u201d and he vowed to sue to stop the bill on expanding profiling claims. \u201cIt is a dangerous piece of legislation,\u201d he said, \u201cand we will ask the courts to step in before innocent people are harmed.\u201d         \n\nFor the mayor, who argued strenuously and repeatedly in public to head off the passage of the bills, the votes offered a stark reminder of his diminished ability to influence city politics in the waning months of his administration.         \n\nThe 51-member Council, led by its speaker, Christine C. Quinn, enacted the two measures by voting to override Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s earlier veto of both bills.         \n\nThe Council voted overwhelmingly to create an independent inspector general for the department, with 39 in favor and 10 opposed. The second bill, which would expand the ability of New Yorkers to sue the police over bias-based profiling, passed with exactly the 34 votes necessary for an override. Ms. Quinn, who is running for mayor, voted against it. (Two members were absent from the vote.)         \n\nDuring the two hours of discussing and voting, supporters described the measures, collectively known as the Community Safety Act, as intended to increase trust in the Police Department. \u201cNo one on this floor is anti-N.Y.P.D.,\u201d said Councilman Jumaane D. Williams, a Brooklyn Democrat who was a co-sponsor of the legislation. \u201cWe are antipolicies that are not working.\u201d         \n\nNew York has by far the largest police department in the country, and its crime drop has been bigger and more sustained than in most other major cities. As a result, the contentious debate over how the police conduct stops has been closely followed.         \n\nAt the heart of the issue is a debate about just how effective the stop-and-frisk policy is. A standard policing practice, police stops ballooned over the last decade as crime fell.         \n\nIn the last year and a half, however, the Police Department has recorded significantly fewer stops, and crime has continued to go down. Mayor Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly have argued that the practice is crucial in their efforts to fight crime, and that recent declines in stops followed better training. Detractors say it is ineffective, turning up little criminal activity, and point to the continuing crime drop as proof.         \n\nFor the second time in two weeks, Mr. Kelly bristled at the suggestion of racial profiling on his watch, saying in a statement that the legislation \u201cwill have an adverse impact not only on our police officers but more importantly on the people and the neighborhoods they serve, particularly in minority communities.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/23/nyregion/council-overrules-bloomberg-on-police-monitor-and-profiling-suits.html", "date": "2013-08-22", "description": "The City Council voted Thursday to greatly increase oversight of the New York Police Department and of its widespread use of stop-and-frisk tactics."}
