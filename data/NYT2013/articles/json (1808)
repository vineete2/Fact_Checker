A select group of writers, including Nicholson Baker, Alison Bechdel, Rachel Kushner, Geoff Dyer and Jackie Collins, will share their memories of the first illicit thing they ever read. They describe the mixture of fear, shame, elation and pure raw nerves they felt reading something without the endorsement of parents or teachers.         \n\nThe Book Review would like to collect your stories, too. Please share your experience with the first book, poem or other work of literature that felt forbidden. Was it thrilling? Terrifying? Both? Was it in the library, at home, at a friend\u2019s house? Did it lead to further reading? We\u2019ll feature our favorite reader replies with the Book Review essays when we publish them online Friday.
