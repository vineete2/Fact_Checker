{"headline": "Pink Robots at the Gate", "body": "\nPALM SPRINGS, CALIF. \u2014 Kenny Irwin Jr. is not one of those brooding, creatively blocked artists, as one glance at his father\u2019s backyard confirms. Ken Irwin Sr. once owned a pristine two-acre spread in a prized part of town. Then he made the generous or foolish decision, depending on your viewpoint, to hand over the property to his son as a place to build and display the astonishing over-scaled sculptures that Kenny Jr. makes by fusing found materials with tons of glue.         \n\nNow, Santa\u2019s Battle Wagon and a team of 12 robot reindeer occupy a patch of lawn near the pool, while a 50-foot-tall, 54-ton robot made partly of junked electronics diverts attention from the tasteful desert landscaping.         \n\nAnd forget about playing a few sets on the tennis court.         \n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s elf village, with post-apocalyptic extraterrestrial nuclear elves,\u201d Kenny Jr. said, leading a visitor on a walk through a landscape resembling the set of a Tim Burton film. Wearing a beige shalwar kameez and a long, untrimmed beard (he became a Muslim a decade ago), Kenny Jr., 39, had the gleeful smile of a child given a very large sandbox to play in.         \n\nGeorgia Eisner, his older sister, recalled how, years before he took over the backyard, he would appropriate her possessions as material for his art while she was away at boarding school. \u201cIt was clear my typewriter ended up in one of his structures,\u201d she said. \u201cMy shell collection disappeared. He glued it to the wall.\u201d         \n\nRemembering her exasperation, she added: \u201cI would think, can\u2019t I have a normal brother who plays sports? He was the weirdo that was always off playing by himself and talking about outer space.\u201d         \n\nKenny Jr.\u2019s ideas come in a geyserlike rush, he explained, inspired by vivid dreams of aliens and distant planets. His main challenge is keeping up with them. \u201cThe amount of energy that goes through me is absolutely, utterly relentless,\u201d he said. \u201cThink of it as the floodgates are unleashed and the flood doesn\u2019t ever stop. It\u2019s been that way my whole life.\u201d         \n\nFor several years, his creative energy has been channeled into  \n, the ever-expanding holiday display he began in 1986, at age 12. Last year, 20,000 people visited the sprawling installation, which features Santa\u2019s Pink Robot Store and a manger scene with baby Jesus wearing a Sumo-style topknot and wise men bearing gifts of toy microwaves.         \n\n \n, the estate Frank Sinatra owned one block over, grows paler as a neighborhood attraction every year.         \n\nIn October, an indoor version of Robo Lights will be  \n at the American Visionary Art Museum, or AVAM, in Baltimore, said Rebecca Alban Hoffberger, the museum\u2019s director and founder. Kenny Jr.\u2019s work will be part of an exhibit on technology called \u201cHuman, Soul and Machine: The Coming Singularity.\u201d         \n\n\u201cKenny is one of a handful of people who continue to fascinate me,\u201d Ms. Hoffberger said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of sci-fi work out there, and it tends to look alike. His work looks like no one else\u2019s.\u201d         \n\nLIKE A ONE-MAN RECYCLING CENTER, Kenny Jr. collects old phones, cassette tapes, wood, the innards of slot machines, garbage can lids, pool filters, a neighbor\u2019s wrecked glider, an air compressor from a commercial building \u2014 anything he can get his hands on, basically \u2014 and using multiple cans of Touch \u2019n Foam sealant, gives form to his visions.         \n\nHis sculptures have a Seurat-like quality: a pink Clydesdale looks monumental from a distance; up close, its hooves are revealed as boxy computer monitors, its noble head a printer and fax machine glued together, its mane a tangle of power cords.         \n\nAliens, robots and monsters appear in Kenny Jr.\u2019s work with obsessive frequency. But he maintains that his inspiration doesn\u2019t come from comic books or B-movies. His robot sculptures are \u201cinstantaneously generated creations that go through my mind,\u201d he said. \u201cI know exactly what they look like, and I make them.\u201d (An interest in the far-out is perhaps hereditary: Kenny Jr.\u2019s paternal grandmother was a singer and bandleader whose 1969 album,  \n a jazzy account of her \u201ctrip\u201d to the moon, is a cult classic for its wacky na\u00efvet\u00e9. Tony Kushner  \n a play about her called \u201cFlip Flop Fly.\u201d)         \n\nKenny Jr. beamed into the larger culture briefly in 2010, when Conan O\u2019Brien asked him to design the holiday set for his talk show. The host appeared delighted with the results (Godzilla wielding a candy cane; a Christmas U.F.O.), though it was hard to tell if the creator was in on the joke. In a backstage interview, Kenny Jr. answered Mr. O\u2019Brien\u2019s sardonic questions about \u201cMr. and Mrs. Sanmagnetron Claus\u201d with deadpan sincerity, seemingly oblivious to the incongruity of a man in full Islamic dress designing Christmas decorations.
