{"headline": "When Lawyers Cut Their Clients Out of the Deal", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 \u201cWe always knew this settlement would get a tremendous amount of attention,\u201d  \n  \n in San Francisco a couple of years ago.         \n\nHe was defending a novel bargain he had struck with  \n on behalf of millions of users whose privacy he said the company had violated. The settlement\u2019s central innovation was to cut Mr. Kamber\u2019s clients out of the deal.         \n\nThe class members would get nothing. The plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers would get about $2.3 million. Facebook would make a roughly $6.5 million payment \u2014 to a new foundation it would partly control.         \n\nThe appeals court  \n last year by a 2-to-1 vote, with the majority saying it was \u201cfair, adequate and free from collusion.\u201d Last month, critics of the settlement  \n to hear the case.         \n\nThe Facebook settlement certainly explores new frontiers in class-action creativity. For starters, consider the plaintiffs.         \n\n\u201cThey do not get one cent,\u201d Judge Andrew J. Kleinfeld wrote in dissent. \u201cThey do not even get an injunction against Facebook doing exactly the same thing to them again.\u201d         \n\nIn exchange for nothing, the plaintiffs gave up their right to sue Facebook and its partners in a program called Beacon, which automatically, and alarmingly, displayed their purchases and video rentals. The program has been shuttered, but its legal legacy lives on.         \n\n\u201cThis settlement perverts the class action into a device for depriving victims of remedies for wrongs,\u201d Judge Kleinfeld wrote, \u201cwhile enriching both the wrongdoers and the lawyers purporting to represent the class.\u201d         \n\nThe Supreme Court will soon decide whether to hear the case, Marek v. Lane, No. 13-136. The justices have been quite active in restricting other aspects of class actions, and they may decide it is time to consider settlements that critics say leave plaintiffs worse off than when they started.         \n\nClass-action lawyers call the diversion of settlement money from victims to other uses \u201ccy pres.\u201d The fancy-sounding term is derived from a French legal expression, \u201ccy pres comme possible,\u201d or \u201cas near as possible.\u201d         \n\n \n can make sense in the law of charitable trusts, where executors unable to fulfill a dead person\u2019s wishes precisely are allowed to use the estate\u2019s money for a similar purpose.         \n\nMr. Kamber told the appeals court that the new foundation, financed with Facebook\u2019s money and dedicated to protecting privacy rights, was in the same analytical ballpark. \u201cThis is more beneficial to the class,\u201d he said of the foundation, \u201cthan a $1.12 check to each member of the class.\u201d         \n\nThe leading critic of abusive class-action settlements is Ted Frank of the  \n, and he is one of the lawyers challenging the Facebook settlement. In  \n in March before a House subcommittee, Mr. Frank said Facebook\u2019s payment to the new charity bordered on a sham.         \n\n\u201cThat is like a settlement against Microsoft settling for Microsoft giving money to the  \n,\u201d he said, referring to the foundation created by Microsoft\u2019s chairman, Bill Gates, and his wife, Melinda.         \n\n \n, the lead lawyer on the new Supreme Court petition, said he hoped the Supreme Court would consider the dangerous incentives created by these kinds of class-action settlements.         \n\n\u201cCy pres awards only increase the risk of collusion,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause they facilitate settlements that are cheaper and easier for defendants, still provide high fees for class attorneys, but sell class members down the river.\u201d         \n\nOther appeals courts have been more skeptical of creative class-action settlements.         \n\nThis month, for instance, the federal appeals court in Cincinnati  \n of a lawsuit that claimed, against the weight of the evidence, that some Pampers diapers had caused severe diaper rash.         \n\nThe lawyers got $2.73 million \u2014 \u201cthis in a case where counsel did not take a single deposition, serve a single request for written discovery, or even file a response\u201d to the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the case, Judge Raymond M. Kethledge wrote for the majority of a divided three-judge panel of the court.         \n\nIn return, the company got a comprehensive litigation cease-fire.         \n\nAnd the plaintiffs? The company agreed to make modest changes to its packaging and Web site and to extend a refund program, but only for people who had thought to keep original receipts and part of the box from as long ago as 2008.         \n\n\u201cWho does this sort of thing?\u201d Judge Kethledge wrote, suggesting that the settlement would benefit only exceptionally well-organized hoarders.         \n\n\u201cThe relief that this settlement provides to unnamed class members is illusory,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut one fact about this settlement is concrete and indisputable: $2.73 million is $2.73 million.\u201d         \n\n\u2022         \n\nLast month,  \n a commitment Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. had made in October in  \n over a secret government surveillance program. He said the plaintiffs in the case had not shown that they had been spied on and so lacked standing to sue.         \n\nThis did not mean, he added, that no one could ever sue. If the government wanted to use information from the program in a criminal prosecution, he said, it would have to disclose that to the defendant, who would then have standing to challenge the program.         \n\nIn the months that followed the argument, federal prosecutors disregarded the commitment and argued that they were not required to make the promised disclosures.         \n\nOn July 30, in a development  \n by The Wall Street Journal, the government reversed course. In  \n in Florida, it disavowed its earlier legal position. On Thursday, prosecutors said  \n to a federal judge in Chicago.         \n\nBut the filings contained only statements of principle. The government has apparently yet to make a disclosure of the sort Mr. Verrilli described.
