{"headline": "Fennel and Lemon Turn Swordfish Into a More Complex Meal", "body": "\n \n         \n\nSwordfish is a hardy, meaty fish that needs slow, gentle cooking. Use a high flame and cook it just 30 extra seconds and you risk turning the fish from tender and juicy to chalky and tough.         \n\nTo lower that risk, I like to cut thick swordfish steaks into chunks, then saut\u00e9 them delicately in plenty of fat. The fat \u2013 oil, butter or a combination \u2013 cushions the fish against the heat of the pan. It also provides plenty of flavor, particularly if you use both good olive oil and butter for richness. It\u2019s a fast-cooking, weeknight-easy technique that I use whenever I can get my hands on a nice piece of swordfish.         \n\nOnce you\u2019ve got the cooking method down, you can change up the seasonings to suit your mood and the state of your pantry. Recently in my pantry (so to speak, I really mean the fridge) was a fennel bulb. I had salad-bowl plans for the bulb itself, but chopped up the feathery green fronds for the swordfish. To increase the fennel factor, I also added some fennel seed, along with garlic, chile flakes and lemon zest. It was complex, savory, straightforward.         \n\nIf you don\u2019t happen to have fennel fronds that need using, you could substitute basil, parsley or cilantro. And if you don\u2019t like fennel seeds, try substituting cumin or coriander seeds. Or leave them out and double the chile. Swordfish can take a lot of heat, just as long as you\u2019re gentle with the flame.         \n\nRecipe:  \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/19/dining/fennel-and-lemon-turn-swordfish-into-a-complex-but-straightforward-meal.html", "date": "2013-11-18", "description": "Swordfish can take a lot of heat, just as long as you\u2019re gentle with the flame."}
