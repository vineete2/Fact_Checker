{"headline": "Japan\u2019s Top Voice: High, Polite and on the Phone", "body": "\nSENDAI, Japan \u2014 The contestants roll their shoulders and lick their lips. The audience holds its breath. At the center of attention on stage at an expansive convention hall: a single telephone.         \n\nIt rings. The annual All- \n Phone-Answering Competition for office workers has begun.         \n\n\u201cHow may I help you today?\u201d a young contestant in a checked vest and skirt uniform says in Japanese after she picks up the phone, her hand visibly shaking. She chirps through the salutations in the high-pitched voice preferred by Japanese bosses for decades. She nods and bows, smiles and then grimaces in what appears to be nervousness and sheer effort. \u201cI\u2019m always at your service,\u201d she says.         \n\nFor over a half-century, office workers from companies across Japan have gathered each year to battle it out for the title of Japan\u2019s best phone answerer.         \n\nThe competition, which is dominated by women, is an impressive showcase of feminine politeness and eloquence, but it is also a reminder of the clerical positions Japanese women \u2014 often referred to as \u201coffice ladies,\u201d or \u201cO.L.\u2019s\u201d \u2014 still serve in Japanese offices.         \n\nThis year, a record 12,613 office workers from across Japan sought to compete in the national contest. Sixty finalists made it, all but four of them women.         \n\nNow in its 52nd year, the contest has surged in popularity in recent years. That is a puzzling development in a digital age dominated by emails and instant messaging and one in which Japanese women \u2014 ever so slowly \u2014 are finding more opportunities in the workplace.         \n\nOrganizers of the event, which now draws over twice the number of contestants as it did a decade ago, attribute that popularity to the enduring importance of politeness here, as well as a growing concern among some employers that younger Japanese are forgetting their basic manners.         \n\nThe rise of outsourcing and professional call centers, now almost a 700 billion yen ($6.85 billion) industry in Japan, has created a new industry based on professional phone answering, they say.         \n\n\u201cOpportunities for voice communication are decreasing every year, yet the number of contestants keeps increasing. That shows Japan\u2019s commitment to phone manners will never fade,\u201d Masayuki Yamamura, president of NTT East, one of the event\u2019s corporate sponsors, said at the opening ceremony.         \n\nFormal phone answering is serious business in Japan, with many rules intended to head off offensive or awkward moments. A search on Amazon\u2019s Japanese website found more than 60 books specifically on phone manners, and dozens more on business etiquette in general. Most appeared to be aimed at women, like \u201cHow to Talk Like a Workplace Beauty.\u201d         \n\nA polite office worker picks up calls during the first or second rings; if, for unavoidable reasons, the caller is left waiting for three rings or more, an apology is in order. The conversation itself is carried out in a formal, honorific spoken form of language \u2014 peppered with exclamations like \u201cI\u2019m horrified to ask this request, but ...\u201d At the end of the call, the receptionist must listen for the caller to hang up before putting down the receiver. Hanging up first is a serious faux pas.         \n\nSome experts explicitly tell women to speak in a higher voice than usual to sound feminine and energetic. \u201cThink of the musical scale \u2014 do, re, mi, fa \u2014 and imagine speaking in fa,\u201d says Akiko Mizuki, a business manner expert on  \n.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to be polite but effortlessly so. If you sound like a robot, you can\u2019t put the caller at ease,\u201d said Keiko Nagashima, manager at a call center for SBI Securities in Tokyo, which has been sending workers to compete in the competition for the last five years.         \n\nMs. Nagashima\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Mika Otani, trained six months for the competition by writing out sample answers and practicing in front of a mirror to make sure she was properly opening up her larynx and articulating. But Ms. Otani, 26, does not plan to simply follow tradition. She considers herself a modern woman and shuns the high-pitched voice. As more women have taken on professional positions in recent years, she said, there has been a backlash against overly squeaky voices.         \n\n\u201cI work at a financial institution, so I don\u2019t want to sound like a cartoon character,\u201d Ms. Otani said before the competition.
