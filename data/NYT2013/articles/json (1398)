{"headline": "The Men in Late Night Dreams", "body": "\nI have noticed these days that reporters never talk to each other about sleeping with their subjects.         \n\nI chalk this up to respectability and the fact that when I had these conversations I was in my 20s and worked for the old New York Post and now I get into movies on a senior discount and write for The New York Times.         \n\nEven then it didn\u2019t happen much. There are only a few men I met on stories I can remember going out with and I always followed the journalism rule:         \n\nYou can have a personal relationship with a subject only after the reporting and writing are finished and the story has run, and, if you do, you can never write about that person again. You have kissed objectivity, among other things, goodbye. Or as a former executive editor of this newspaper put it and I\u2019m going to have to clean it up \u2014 \" \u2018I don\u2019t care if my reporters have intimate congress with an elephant, as long as they do not cover the circus.\u2019 \u201d         \n\nWhich is kind of appropriate, because the subject I am telling you about was Gunther Gebel-Williams, the star animal trainer at Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey circus. I interviewed him for the first time when I was about 25, and even now when the posters for the circus go up in spring I think of him. Oh be still my statin-protected heart.         \n\nI first saw Gunther at Madison Square Garden, riding around the ring standing up on a white horse with his pet leopard, Kenny, around his neck. The first thing I noticed was that both the leopard and horse seemed fine with this arrangement, the second that the star of the show obviously dyed his hair, a very bad amateur job, white peroxide blond.         \n\n\u201cWhat a ridiculous guy,\u201d I thought, but simultaneously there was a feeling, which, were I a cartoon character with a bubble coming out of my head, would have been something like, \u201cArr-arrrf, Woof, Woof!!\u201d If there was animal magnetism, this guy had it, unless it was the horse.         \n\nI went behind the arena, near the elephants, to interview him. It smelled like dung and sawdust and popcorn \u2013 in short, like circus, to me one of the world\u2019s greatest smells. As the star, Gunther, who came from Germany and spoke English with a heavy accent, was allowed to have the trailer he shared with his wife and two children here. A tiger had recently given birth and Gunther had taken the cubs from the mother and was bottle-feeding them. If a tiger gives birth in captivity, she kills her cubs rather than have them live in a cage, Gunther said. I had no idea if this was true, but it\u2019s the sort of detail features writers are suckers for.         \n\nThe adult tigers were in cages not far from the trailer. Their teeth were enormous. When Gunther put his hand in one of the cages to pet one, it let him scratch its neck as if it were a housecat.         \n\n\u201cHey, Gunter, what would happen if I tried that?\u201d I asked.         \n\nHe grabbed my rear end and squeezed it.         \n\n\u201cYou vould lose dis, I think,\u201d he said.         \n\nThis move was, of course, seriously inappropriate. Had one of my more egregious subjects, say Mickey Rooney, tried it, he would have been dead meat. I use Mickey Rooney not only because if subjects were organized along a spectrum of physical attractiveness, Gunther Gebel-Williams would be at one end and Mickey Rooney would be so far away he would require a whole other spectrum, say one with Jabba the Hutt, but because his manners were revolting. When I interviewed Mr. Rooney he had belched loudly, then lifted his shirt to expose his pot belly and patted it fondly as if they had collaborated in something of which they could be proud.         \n\nGunther Gebel-Williams, on the other hand, generated tremendous sexual heat and good cheer. If this guy grabbed your rear the only thought any healthy woman, even a pay your own way feminist like me, would have to be, \u201cWhoa! What else have you got?\u201d         \n\nBy the time this happened to me, my standards had already been corrupted by journalism and I thought \u201cWhoa! Great copy.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/21/booming/the-men-in-late-night-dreams.html", "date": "2013-03-21", "description": "A reporter remembers a man who came to town with the circus."}
