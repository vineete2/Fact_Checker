{"headline": "Charity Takes Gun Lobby Closer to Its Quarry", "body": "\nOn a Monday evening in early February, two months into a national debate over gun violence after the massacre at a Connecticut elementary school, representatives of the firearms industry were wining and dining lawmakers in Washington.         \n\nThe occasion was the \u201cChanging of the Guard\u201d reception and dinner for the incoming leadership of the Congressional Sportsmen\u2019s Caucus, which counts  \n in the House and Senate. Hosting the gathering was a little-known but well-connected organization, the  \n.         \n\nDespite its low profile, the foundation has close ties to members of Congress, allowing its donors, who give as much as $100,000 a year, to mix with lawmakers at shooting contests, banquets and wine tastings. The food and drink at last month\u2019s gathering were paid for in part by the  \n and the trade group for the gun industry.         \n\nOver the past year, sportsmen\u2019s caucus members have clinked glasses and puffed cigars at a \u201cWine, Wheels and Wildlife\u201d fund-raiser at a North Carolina vineyard, a \u201cWhiskies of the World\u201d and cigar reception on Capitol Hill, and a \u201cStars and Stripes Shootout\u201d in Tampa, Fla., where the top shooting awards went to a Republican congressman and a lobbyist for the N.R.A. Such events provide the firearms industry and other foundation donors with a tax-deductible means of lobbying the elected officials who shape policies important to their businesses.         \n\nA private charity not affiliated with the government, the foundation carries the cachet of its relationship with the sportsmen\u2019s caucus in Congress, which it provides with research on policies affecting hunting and fishing. But while ostensibly focused on those outdoor pursuits, it also presses issues important mainly to the gun industry, which is one of its largest contributors.         \n\nThe foundation opposes restrictions on high-capacity ammunition magazines, a ban on military-style AR-15 rifles and the imprinting of bullets with traceable serial numbers to help solve crimes. All of those proposals have surfaced in the current legislative debate, which is expected to continue Thursday when a Senate Judiciary Committee considers a bill to curb illegal gun trafficking.         \n\nThe foundation says its positions fit naturally with its mission \u201cto work with Congress, governors and state legislatures to protect and advance hunting, recreational angling, and shooting and trapping.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThere is significant overlap between access to firearms and the ability to participate in hunting and recreational shooting activities,\u201d it said in a statement.         \n\nOthers see the linkage to hunting as part of a calculated effort by the firearms industry to advance policies that have little to do with outdoor sports. Representative Bill Pascrell Jr., a New Jersey Democrat who as a co-chairman of the law enforcement caucus has butted heads with the sportsmen\u2019s caucus on gun issues, said pro-gun groups had stoked fear in Congress by portraying any limits on firearms as a threat to legitimate pastimes like hunting.         \n\n\u201cThey see this as if they give in on any one item, it will put them on a slippery slope to coming into your home and taking your guns away,\u201d Mr. Pascrell said. \u201cThey\u2019re creating hysteria.\u201d         \n\nLawmakers have long formed caucuses on specific subjects as varied as drug addiction and capital gains taxes. Special interests often press their cases with caucus members, sometimes through receptions, trips and fund-raisers. But most caucuses do not have foundations or institutes set up specifically for that purpose, and financed with private contributions.         \n\nEstablished in 1989 as the Congressional Sportsmen\u2019s Caucus Foundation \u2014 the word \u201ccaucus\u201d was dropped in 1994 \u2014 the foundation is a nonprofit charity under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, meaning it can accept unlimited, tax-deductible donations. Its charitable purpose, according to tax records, is to \u201cprovide scientific research, wildlife management, public education and conservation information.\u201d It says it does this by giving nonpartisan \u201cadvice, support and information\u201d to the sportsmen\u2019s caucus and elected state officials.         \n\nMany of its programs focus on wildlife conservation, on open space and on hunting, including an  \n. It has held briefings or issued policy statements on opening public lands and waterways for hunting and fishing, easing limits on imports of skins and other trophies from polar bear hunting and opposing regulation of the lead content in fishing-line sinkers. But it also backs gun-industry positions whose relevance to its historical focus on hunting and fishing is indirect at best.
