{"headline": "In Renderings for a Library Landmark, Stacks of Questions", "body": "\nNone of New York\u2019s great buildings embody the spirit of the city more than the New York Public Library, the cherished century-old Beaux-Arts landmark in the heart of Midtown Manhattan. But cities change \u2014 New York all the time \u2014 and even the greatest buildings may need to change with them. So it was that more than four years ago the library announced a $250 million plan (since revised upward to $300 million and still rising). Norman Foster, the celebrity architect, was enlisted to revamp and modernize the 42nd Street building.         \n\nThe plan gave New Yorkers plenty to fight about: Would it cripple scholarship by hindering access to research materials? Would it offend the dignity of a venerated space by opening it up to Starbucks-slurping teenagers and transitory mobs scouring DVDs? Would it bring the financial efficiencies promised?         \n\nBut only lately, since  \n revealed sketches last month, has it been possible to see an actual rendering of the proposal. Having looked at it and spent a few hours speaking with the library\u2019s president, Anthony W. Marx, and with other library officials, and after further discussions with Mr. Foster, I\u2019m not buying it.         \n\nEven after all these years, more time is needed to figure this thing out.         \n\nThe plan entails closing two troubled branches: the dilapidated  \n across the street, which serves 1.5 million visitors a year, and the  \n, a profligate investment from 20 years ago that remains a cautionary tale.         \n\nThis time the bright idea involves demolishing the deteriorating seven floors of the structurally integral book stacks in the vault space under the  \n at 42nd Street, and in its place installing a brand-new circulating library, designed by Mr. Foster: major transplant surgery, with the great building designed by Carr\u00e8re and Hastings as guinea pig.         \n\nClosing these two branches and consolidating operations will save money, library officials insist. Selling the two buildings that house the branch libraries should raise a fortune. The books now in the 42nd Street stacks (a space whose decades-long decline, through various renovation campaigns, suggests to me a kind of demolition by neglect) would be sent to state-of-the-art storage below Bryant Park and in New Jersey.         \n\nAt the same time, rooms now unused in the 42nd Street building would be thrown open to writers and children. And so the research library would be joined under one roof with a circulating one.         \n\nThe motivation is money, and there\u2019s no denying that the library needs it. Combined with private donations and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s commitment of $150 million from taxpayers, the plan is supposed to accumulate an endowment that would yield perhaps $7 million to $15 million a year, partly by eliminating the expense of operating the branches. That money would go toward buying more books, rehiring laid-off staff members and other things the public needs. So library officials see it.         \n\nThe parties in charge are earnest in their conversations. While remaining hard to pin down on the dollar amounts, they are eager to demonstrate that every conceivable alternative strategy has been explored, weighed, re-examined and rejected. Proceeding in any other way than by investing in this potential Alamo of engineering, architecture and finance would be irresponsible, they\u2019ve concluded. I have found this to be a not-uncommon phenomenon among cultural boards, a form of architectural Stockholm syndrome.         \n\nThere is, in the abstract, something catchy about the Chinese puzzle ingenuity of the plan, about the consolidation and reinvention of the century-old stack space. I can see how the idea caught on.         \n\nThe problem with it is not, as many prominent writers and scholars have complained, its excessive populism or the inconveniencing of researchers who might have to wait an extra day for books to arrive at 42nd Street from New Jersey. These snobbish-sounding objections have only fueled the library\u2019s public relations offensive, which has advertised the plan as democratizing a building that many New Yorkers find intimidating.         \n\nBut the library, free and open, is already an exemplar of democracy at its healthiest and best, of society making its finest things available to all. Climbing the library steps, passing the lions, rising up to the reading room where anyone can ask for books, enshrines, architecturally, the pursuit of enlightenment. Inspiring more people to reach those heights is the library\u2019s loftiest mission. Peddling \u201cdemocracy\u201d as if it were a popularity contest is what \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d does.
