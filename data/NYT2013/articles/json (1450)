{"headline": "Carpet Diem (but Watch Your Back)", "body": "\n \n         \n\nI  \n recently, and since a number of readers were kind enough to ask how this happened, I have decided to put modesty aside and tell you.         \n\nI was walking through my neighborhood in Greenwich Village, when suddenly clouds of dark smoke began billowing out of a brownstone, and a hysterical young woman appeared in a window, carrying something small and precious, screaming: \u201cSave my iPad Mini! Save my iPad Mini!\u201d It was clear every moment counted, so I implored her to throw it to me. Giving the tablet an anguished final kiss (for indeed, moments later, the poor woman was consumed in flames), she tossed it to me, and I, ignoring my own safety, leapt into the middle of West 13th Street, saving the tablet but getting clipped by a sanitation truck, which ruptured disks at L2-L3, L3-L4 and L4-L5.         \n\nO.K., O.K, I made that up, because frankly I am a little embarrassed about what really happened: that I, a successful middle-aged woman, financially secure enough to afford the occasional upgrade to business  \nclass, at least on a short domestic flight, succumbed to my old weakness, being unable to bypass a discarded treasure in the street.         \n\nIt was, in my defense, a genuine treasure, an Oriental carpet, rolled up and propped against the side of a dry-cleaning shop. True, the pattern was a bit muddied on the side, but I attributed this to the rain that had been falling all morning. A homeless man, seeing me inspecting it, concurred that it was an excellent piece.         \n\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s one nice rug,\u201d he said. \u201cI was thinking of taking it myself.\u201d         \n\n \n(\u201cWhat?\u201d my brother David told me, when I was telling him this. \u201cAnd this homeless guy didn\u2019t offer you his piece of cardboard and some nice string, too? And you didn\u2019t take it?\u201d)         \n\nNor was my best friend, whom I shall call Herb, happy to hear about my latest find, though for years I have been trying to convert him.         \n\n\u201cWhy are you never interested in this great stuff we keep seeing in the street?\u201d I say.         \n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s in the street because somebody threw it out,\u201d Herb says. \u201cAnd if they threw it out, it\u2019s because it\u2019s no good.\u201d         \n\nI, on the other hand, feel something might be in the street because it is an unappreciated, undervalued diamond in the rough that in the right environment would shine. If you wish to read projective-identification into this, believe me, I\u2019m 40 years ahead of you.         \n\nIt\u2019s true, this rolled up rug might have had a hidden tear. But with a hard rain a-falling (I do like to slip Bob Dylan into the column, especially when it involves home furnishings), I was disinclined to spread the rug on the sidewalk and examine it.         \n\nThere was, however, a fine-antique-carpet store around the corner, so I figured I would just take the rug there and see what the professionals had to say.         \n\nNow, I have no idea what a dry 6-by-9 carpet weighs, but I can tell you whatever it is, it\u2019s a lot more when it's been standing out in the rain. Getting it up on my shoulder was tough, and carrying it was so strenuous I had to stop every 20 feet and put it down, not because I felt any pressure on my spine but to catch my breath. I was pleased, of course, by the applause of some construction workers as they watched me wrestle it back on my shoulder, though not as much as if one had said, \u201cHey, little lady, might we lend a hand?\u201d Probably they were too busy laying bets about when I would drop dead.         \n\nAnyway, I dragged the rug and myself into the carpet store, past four-foot stacks of carpets, any one of which could put your kid through a half semester of college. Astonishingly, though there were no other customers, the owners showed no delight in my arrival.         \n\n\u201cGet that thing out of here,\u201d one said, \u201cIt\u2019s dripping wet.\u201d         \n\n \n My God, we were gushing. We were a burst five-foot-diameter water main. Any minute Con Ed would be tearing down Fifth Avenue, shutting down the street.         \n\n\u201cJust \u2013 let me \u2013 sit down,\u201d I said.
