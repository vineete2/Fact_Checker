{"headline": "What to Do With Your Retirement Plan if You Change Jobs", "body": "\nKya Gream, 25, recently started a new job as a medical office assistant in Champaign, Ill. Her old employer sent her a thick packet about her options for rolling over her retirement plan, but she has not taken the time yet to digest the information, since it looks a bit daunting.         \n\nStill, she has worked hard to amass a five-figure nest egg, and aims to avoid emulating a friend who drained her own retirement account to pay for her wedding: \u201cI\u2019ve read that it\u2019s terrible to cash out your 401(k),\u201d she said.         \n\nYet, that\u2019s just what many 20-somethings end up doing. More than half of workers in their 20s who have 401(k) plans cash out their holdings when they change jobs, partly because their balances are relatively low, according to a report from the benefits consultant Aon Hewitt. Only about a third of those who change jobs in their 50s do the same, according to the report, which examined 1.8 million participants in 110 large retirement plans.         \n\nJacob Kuebler, a friend of Ms. Gream and a financial planner with Bluestem Financial Advisors in Champaign, says when young adults are switching jobs, money is often tight \u2014 they may be moving, and need financing for rental deposits and other costs \u2014 and it is tempting to withdraw the cash.         \n\nIn addition, he said, it is often difficult for them to envision retirement, when they are just starting their careers. Carrie Schwab-Pomerantz, president of the Charles Schwab Foundation, a nonprofit organization set up by Charles Schwab & Company, said cashing out was a mistake. The withdrawn funds will be counted as income, and subject to tax.         \n\nAlso consider that you\u2019ll pay a penalty for withdrawing the money before retirement age \u2014 as this example from Charles Schwab shows. Say you have $10,000 in your retirement plan, and you cash it out. You\u2019ll pay a 10 percent federal penalty, or $1,000, for taking an early retirement withdrawal.         \n\nAnd, because the money was put into the account on a pretax basis, the total amount is subject to income taxes \u2014 about $2,500, based on a 25 percent marginal tax rate. So you\u2019ll net just $6,500 \u2014 and possibly less, when any state taxes and penalties are included. But the real impact comes from the longer-term, tax-deferred investment you will lose out on.         \n\nAccording to Schwab\u2019s projection, which assumes an annual return of 6 percent, the funds could be worth more than $100,000 after 40 years. That\u2019s why it generally pays to reinvest the funds in a retirement account. Your options may include leaving the money where it is, or reinvesting \u2014 \u201crolling over\u201d \u2014 the funds into your new employer\u2019s 401(k) or into an individual retirement account. \u201cResist the urge to cash out,\u201d Ms. Schwab-Pomerantz said.         \n\nHere are some questions to consider about your retirement account when you\u2019re changing jobs:         \n\n\u25a0  \n         \n\nIn general, you can let the money stay put as long as you have more than $5,000 in the account; employers may or may not allow you to do so if the balance is lower. But you cannot contribute new funds to the account after you leave, and it may be harder for you to keep track of what you have if it is in multiple locations.         \n\n\u25a0  \n         \n\nThe human resources department at your new company can help walk you through the necessary steps to move the money into its retirement plan. Or, if your new employer does not offer a retirement plan, you can roll the money into an individual retirement account; many investment companies let you set up an I.R.A. online.         \n\n\u25a0  \n         \n\nCompanies may close retirement accounts with balances below $5,000, Mr. Kuebler said. If you don\u2019t elect to roll the money directly into a new retirement account, they may send you the balance, less 20 percent to pay federal taxes. You still have 60 days to put the money into a new retirement account, before it is subject to taxes and penalties. But, Mr. Kuebler warns, you\u2019ll have to deposit the full balance, and the amount withheld cannot be recovered until you file your tax return.
