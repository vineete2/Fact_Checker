Groups Offering Cover for Lawmakers on Immigration", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Fox News viewers in Florida will see a new commercial in the coming weeks urging them to call Senator  \n. \u201cThank him for keeping his promise, and fighting to secure the border,\u201d a narrator says in the ad, which is paid for by the conservative American Action Network.         \n\nAnother group, Americans for a Conservative Direction, led by former Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi and other top Republicans, has been running ads in Iowa lately  \n those watching to \u201cstand with Marco Rubio to end de facto amnesty.\u201d         \n\nAnd when the Americans for Prosperity Foundation, the Koch brothers\u2019 political advocacy group, decided to move its signature annual conference outside Washington for the first time, it picked a spot right in Mr. Rubio\u2019s political backyard: Orlando. The keynote speaker? Mr. Rubio.         \n\nMr. Rubio\u2019s advocacy for a proposal that would allow immigrants here illegally to gain a path to citizenship has made him a pariah among some rank-and-file Republicans.         \n\nBut many of the most powerful and well-financed forces in the party are moving to provide cover for the Florida senator and Republicans like him who are pushing to overhaul the nation\u2019s  \n system.         \n\nTheir message: if we ever want to take back the White House, we have to stop devouring our own.         \n\nAs the party assesses its chances for the 2016 presidential campaign, many Republican strategists believe that they need as robust a primary field as possible, with more than just one or two viable potential contenders.         \n\nA messy fight over a subject as touchy as illegal immigration is a prospect many Republican leaders are eager to avoid, especially since three of their best hopes for 2016 are closely tied to the debate: Mr. Rubio, former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, and Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, who is expected to play a vital role once the House starts debating the issue next week.         \n\n\u201cI think we have a great bench,\u201d said Carlos Gutierrez, who was commerce secretary under President George W. Bush and leads the \u201c \n\u201d Republicans for Immigration Reform. \u201cIt\u2019s whether we can stop becoming our own worst enemy.\u201d         \n\nMr. Rubio is just one of several top Republicans who have taken a political risk by supporting the immigration plan that passed the Senate last week, but his situation is the most urgent. No public figure other than President Obama is mentioned more often in news coverage of the immigration debate, an analysis by Kantar Media News Intelligence showed. Mr. Rubio appears in articles almost twice as often as Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, who has often taken the lead in Senate negotiations.         \n\nHis words have been turned into television commercials by groups on both sides of the issue. And no one has taken on more friendly fire. Mr. Rubio has been attacked at  \n rallies (his name elicits boos), on conservative radio (\u201ca piece of garbage,\u201d Glenn Beck  \n) and in National Review (\u201cRubio\u2019s Folly,\u201d declared a recent cover).         \n\nStill, running interference on Mr. Rubio\u2019s behalf is fraught with risk for conservative groups, who are going against many in their own base.         \n\n\u201cWe know that there\u2019s a lot of folks on both sides,\u201d said Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity. \u201cBut I think the vast majority of people appreciate the fact that Senator Rubio is doing what he thinks is best for the country. And that he\u2019s doing it in an open and honest way.\u201d         \n\nMr. Phillips declined to discuss any implications for Mr. Rubio and 2016, but said, \u201cWe think that he\u2019s got a bright future within the movement, and in whatever he chooses to do down the road.\u201d         \n\nMany other big players in the conservative movement would like to keep that future bright as well.         \n\nRalph Reed, president of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, invited Mr. Rubio to speak to several hundred of his members at a conference in Washington last month. Mr. Reed, who has made clear that he believes the Senate immigration bill that Mr. Rubio helped write is too lenient, described the crowd as right-leaning, by Republican standards. \u201cNot the Chamber of Commerce variety,\u201d he noted wryly in an interview.         \n\nBut when he introduced Mr. Rubio, he offered nothing but effusive praise. \u201cWe\u2019re proud to count him as our friend because he has not forgotten who got him here,\u201d Mr. Reed told the crowd, which applauded politely. \u201cHe has not forgotten who he is.\u201d         \n\nWeighing heavily on conservative leaders is a reminder of how immigration policy bedeviled Mitt Romney last year. His \u201cself-deport\u201d comments about what should happen with the 11 million immigrants living illegally in the United States became an easy punch line for Democrats and helped drive Latinos even farther away from the  \n.         \n\nAnd many see the success of an immigration reform package shaped with considerable input from Republicans like Mr. Rubio as key to their future, and his.         \n\n\u201cCertainly the way in which the bill is perceived and Rubio\u2019s own political fortunes are closely entwined,\u201d said Steven Law, president of American Crossroads, Karl Rove\u2019s political outfit, which plans to play a larger role in the debate once House Republicans get deeper into their discussions.         \n\n\u201cOur first priority is to promote and advance immigration reform, and to talk about the ways this advances conservative goals,\u201d Mr. Law added. \u201cIf we do that we will not only be helping to move legislation, but it will also protect those who stuck their necks out like Rubio.\u201d         \n\nMr. Rubio is not the only beneficiary of such efforts. Republicans who backed the measure, including Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who is up for re-election next year, and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, another of the party\u2019s rising stars, have attracted support.         \n\nThe  \n, one of the most active and well-financed proponents of immigration reform, began a seven-figure  \n last week featuring Mr. Rubio, Mr. Ryan and Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, another 2016 contender.         \n\nAnd before its new Florida ad campaign, the American Action Network had already spent nearly three-quarters of a million dollars on pro-immigration-reform commercials featuring Mr. Rubio and Mr. Gutierrez.         \n\nAfter Ms. Ayotte came out in support of the Senate bill and criticism from the right rained down on her, Republicans coordinated a response campaign that included a news conference hosted by four former Republican state party chairmen.         \n\nThe men received a thank-you phone call from Mr. Rubio.
