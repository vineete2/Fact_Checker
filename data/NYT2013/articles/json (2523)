{"headline": "A Few Dollars to Help a Tennis Prospect", "body": "\nAfter Dan Nagler graduated from St. Thomas University in 2008 with degrees in law and business, he opened a sports agency in Miami. Rather than chase the Rafael Nadals and Maria Sharapovas of the world, he wanted to seek out lesser, even struggling, professionals.         \n\nBut he quickly discovered what professional tennis players know: It is difficult to make a decent living outside the top 100.         \n\n\u201cTop 100 covers the basic expenses for the year \u2014 traveling, hotels, coach,\u201d said Julia Glushko, Israel\u2019s No. 2 female player, whom Nagler used to represent.         \n\nRanked No. 128 in the world, Glushko has earned $90,535 in prize money this year. Consider, for example, Denver Nuggets forward Wilson Chandler, who is 128th in  \n and will earn $6.3 million next season. And he does not have to worry about paying his coach or missing paydays with a sprained ankle.         \n\n\u201cSince the lower-ranked players I represented weren\u2019t making any real money and very few people were interested in sponsoring them, I wasn\u2019t making any money from being their agent,\u201d Nagler said.         \n\nLower-ranked pros did not need agents, Nagler realized. They needed backers. In March 2012, he started  \n, which is basically a Kickstarter for sports.         \n\n\u201cThere are a few other sites that do sports, such as  \n, but they\u2019re so watered down,\u201d Nagler said. \u201cGo to them and you\u2019ll see some fan who\u2019s trying to raise money for tickets to a Buffalo Bills game. Involved Fan is about helping a professional player with a direct relationship.\u201d         \n\nAs with Kickstarter, donations come with rewards. For $350, a donor can get an autographed, match-used racket from Glushko. For $250, a donor can get a Skype session with Vahid Mirzadeh, a former No. 1 singles and doubles player for Florida State University, who is trying to make it on the pro doubles tour.         \n\n\u201cI started playing on the tour full time in January, and my dad\u2019s helping me out financially,\u201d said Mirzadeh, who is ranked No. 179 in doubles. \u201cBut it\u2019s tough. I just got back from playing a bunch of European challengers and I did well. I made about $2,500 in prize money, and my expenses were double that. And I wasn\u2019t eating steak dinners and flying a private jet. I was staying in hostels and taking 14-hour train rides.\u201d         \n\nAs a moneymaking tool, though, Involved Fan has been about as successful as Nagler\u2019s agency. Nagler takes a 10 percent cut of the donations, which is standard for crowd-sourcing sites, but no one has received more than Alicia Black, who has collected $565 to date.         \n\nBlack, 15, has yet to turn professional, but has already learned of the financial demands of world-competitive tennis.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m a single mother, devoting my life to my children\u2019s tennis career, and there are tournaments we can\u2019t go to because we can\u2019t afford to travel,\u201d said Alicia\u2019s mother, Gayal Black, who lives in Boca Raton, Fla.         \n\nAlicia Black,  \n, had managed to accumulate a professional ranking (896th) after performing well in a few minor league tournaments, but she lost her ranking points this year because she could not afford to travel.         \n\n\u201cShe\u2019s young, so I just can\u2019t put her on a plane by herself,\u201d Gayal Black said.         \n\nThe same goes for Alicia\u2019s younger sister, Tyra, who has a matching nickname (Hurricane), and is currently the country\u2019s  \n.         \n\nWhile Alicia briefly resided at the United States Tennis Association\u2019s training center in Boca Raton, Gayal said that the U.S.T.A. had not properly supported her daughters\u2019 potential. She said that Tyra had not received any financial support from the association, a claim disputed by Patrick McEnroe, the general manager for player development.         \n\nHe said that the Black sisters received several U.S.T.A. grants, and that Alicia traveled with the national team, which is funded by the U.S.T.A.         \n\n\u201cNow, are our grants enough to cover all the expenses that are associated with raising a professional tennis player? No,\u201d McEnroe said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very expensive sport, and our budget isn\u2019t unlimited.\u201d         \n\nAlicia will be traveling to New York to play in the  \n juniors tournament. Her mother said she hoped contributions through Involved Fan would help with the expenses.         \n\n\u201cJust to have the money to spend an extra night before a tournament and acclimate is a big help,\u201d Gayal Black said. \u201cSome people have given $5, and that\u2019s helpful. It\u2019s a lot of money to me.\u201d         \n\nThe Blacks\u2019 largest benefactor on Involved Fan has been Mark Goodman, a Boston-based entrepreneur, who played on the Harvard varsity team in the 1980s. Goodman read about Alicia in a news article and then found his way to Nagler\u2019s site. He offered $500 to play a set. While visiting his father in Miami, he made the drive to Boca Raton.         \n\n\u201cWe played a serious set,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to lose to a 14-year-old girl.\u201d         \n\nBut lose he did, 6-2.         \n\nInvolved Fan also supports a few non-tennis athletes, including the snowboard cross competitor Jonathan Cheever, who is trying to raise money to train for the Olympics.         \n\nBut for now, the Web site is a side project for Nagler. He works full time at a Miami civil litigation firm. As he devotes more energy to the site and word gets out, Nagler expects Involved Fan to change the dynamic between aspiring professional athletes and fans.         \n\n\u201cIf you contribute to a player, you\u2019re helping him or her go to another tournament or hire a coach,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has a direct effect on the player\u2019s ranking. The ability to affect the sport in that way takes being a fan to a whole new level.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/26/sports/tennis/spare-a-few-dollars-to-help-an-aspiring-athlete.html", "date": "2013-08-22", "description": "The Web site Involved Fan, much in the mold of Kickstarter, hopes to help finance lower-ranked professionals with online donations from fans."}
