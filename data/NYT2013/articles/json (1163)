{"headline": "For That Zeus Bug in Your Life", "body": "\nHere are some last-minute gift ideas to suit even the most discriminating individuals on your list.         \n\nFor the female scorpionfly: an extremely large, glittering, nutrient-laced ball of spit, equivalent to 5 percent to 10 percent of a male fly\u2019s body mass. Gentlemen: Too worn down by the holidays to cough up such an expensive package? Try giving her a dead insect instead. You can always steal it back later.         \n\nFor the male Zeus bug: a monthlong excursion aboard the luxury liner that is the much larger female\u2019s back, with its scooped-out seat tailored to his dimensions and a pair of dorsal glands to supply the passenger with all the proteinaceous wax he can swallow.         \n\nFor the bonobo you\u2019ve just met: half your food, at least. Just shovel it over. Sharing is fun!         \n\nFor the bonobos you\u2019ve known your whole life: Eh, maybe nothing this year. It\u2019s not like they\u2019ll stop being your friend if you \u201cforget\u201d to toss them a banana.         \n\nWe may denounce the hyper-consumerism of the Christmas season until we\u2019re  \n blue in the face, but much of our economy relies on the strength of the gift-giving impulse, and with good reason: The drive to exchange presents is ancient, transcultural and by no means limited to Homo sapiens. Researchers have found striking examples of gift-giving across the phyletic landscape, in insects, spiders, mollusks, birds and mammals.         \n\nMany of these donations fall under the rubric of nuptial gifts, items or services offered up during the elaborate haggle of animal courtship to better the odds that one\u2019s gametes will find purchase in the next generation. Hungry? Why don\u2019t you go ahead and chew on the droplets oozing from my hind-leg spur while I just take a few moments to deposit a sperm packet in the neighborhood of your genitals?         \n\nNuptial gifts can also be a gift for researchers, allowing them to precisely quantify a donor animal\u2019s investment in mating and reproduction, and to track the subtleties of sexual competition and collusion by analyzing the chemical composition of a given bag of courtship swag.         \n\n\u201cThis is an incredibly cool and important topic in sexual selection that we\u2019re just beginning to explore,\u201d said Sara M. Lewis, a professor of biology at Tufts University who has written extensively about nuptial gifts. \u201cThe bright side of nuptial gifts is, here\u2019s a way that males can contribute things that are essential to his mate and to his future offspring.         \n\n\u201cOn the other hand, the gifts can be a source of sexual conflict, a way of manipulating the female into doing what he wants,\u201d she said. \u201cSo there is a lot of back and forth over evolutionary time.\u201d         \n\nOther researchers are studying how animals use gifts socially, to foster alliances or appease dominant members of the group. Grooming among primates is considered a form of gift-giving, and in most cases, it\u2019s the subordinates who do the tick-picking: betas groom alphas, females groom males.         \n\nA nuptial or other animal gift is, by definition, something that is voluntarily given, Dr. Lewis said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s voluntarily received,\u201d she added. \u201cWe\u2019ve all gotten gifts that we didn\u2019t want and wished we could return.\u201d         \n\nOne example of a possibly unwelcome gift, she said, is the snail\u2019s love dart. Land snails like the ones in a garden are hermaphroditic, meaning they produce both eggs and sperm, and they mate by swapping sperm with other snails, often promiscuously. This is why, before copulation, a snail will try to pierce its partner with a love dart, a harpoonlike structure made of calcium carbonate and produced in the snail\u2019s genital region.         \n\nBarely an eighth of an inch long, coated in mucus and ejected with considerable force, the dart may penetrate anywhere on the other snail\u2019s body: through the shell, the head, even the eye. And when it does, it delivers a \u201cgift\u201d of potent hormones, which scientists have lately determined offer little obvious benefit to the recipient but help promote the retention of the donor\u2019s sperm over that of competing snails. No mere victim, the punctured mollusk retorts with a flirty fl\u00e9chette of its own, at which point the dueling Cupids will copulate.
