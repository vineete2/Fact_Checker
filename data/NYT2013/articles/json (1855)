{"headline": "Poll Finds Support for de Blasio, if Not All His Ideas", "body": "\nNew York City voters want to keep Raymond W. Kelly as police commissioner. They want more charter schools. And nearly half of them support the Police Department\u2019s use of the stop-and-frisk tactic.         \n\nBut the city\u2019s voters, by an enormous margin, are planning to support Bill de Blasio for mayor next month, despite the fact that Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, opposes each of those positions, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll released on Friday.         \n\nThe poll found a huge challenge facing Joseph J. Lhota, the Republican nominee, as he seeks to persuade voters in an overwhelmingly Democratic city to choose him. With the election just a month away, on Nov. 5, Mr. de Blasio held a commanding lead of 68 percent to 19 percent among likely voters.         \n\nMore than 4 in 10 likely voters said they had no opinion of Mr. Lhota, while only about a quarter did not have an opinion of Mr. de Blasio, currently the city\u2019s public advocate. And 58 percent had a favorable opinion of Mr. de Blasio, compared with 22 percent who viewed Mr. Lhota favorably.         \n\nMr. Lhota is seeking to change the dynamic. He began broadcasting his first general election television advertisement on Wednesday, pointing out that he supports same-sex marriage, abortion rights and the legalization of marijuana, but that, unlike Mr. de Blasio, he does not plan to raise taxes.         \n\nMr. de Blasio, seeking to thwart any advantage Mr. Lhota might gain from being on the airwaves alone, immediately introduced his own ad, showing a clip from his victory speech on the night of the primary.         \n\nThe race is not over: the two men have agreed to televised debates on three successive Tuesdays this month, and those exchanges, as well as the television ads, will introduce the candidates to New Yorkers who have not yet tuned in.         \n\nBut the poll found extraordinarily daunting odds against Mr. Lhota, a former chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Mr. de Blasio\u2019s lead cut across just about every category: he led among voters regardless of age, race, gender, and income and education level. Registered Republicans made up the only group in which a majority backed Mr. Lhota.         \n\n\u201cI like de Blasio\u2019s general demeanor, his bearing and his poise, and he is more for the common man than Lhota,\u201d Doris Bruntel, 69, a legal proofreader from Chelsea, said in a follow-up interview. She described herself as conservative, but said she believed that Mayors Rudolph W. Giuliani, a Republican, and Michael R. Bloomberg, an independent, had prioritized the concerns of business, and that Mr. de Blasio was \u201clooking out for the rest of us.\u201d         \n\nVoters shared several of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s priorities \u2014 particularly his desire to address income inequality and the high cost of housing and to improve public education. And a majority of voters suggested that they want the next mayor to prioritize reducing the gap between rich and poor, a key plank for Mr. de Blasio, rather than to create a climate that would reduce taxes and regulation to sustain job growth, something emphasized by Mr. Lhota.         \n\nOn most issues, the poll found, Mr. de Blasio enjoyed a strong advantage over Mr. Lhota. By almost four to one, voters thought that Mr. de Blasio would do a better job than Mr. Lhota in improving public education. By almost three to one, they supported Mr. de Blasio\u2019s proposal to increase taxes on high-earners to finance an expansion of prekindergarten education. And by almost two to one, they believed that Mr. de Blasio, not Mr. Lhota, would keep the city safe from crime or a terrorist attack or during a natural disaster.         \n\nSeven in 10 supported creating an independent inspector general to monitor the police \u2014 a measure passed by the City Council with Mr. de Blasio\u2019s support and Mr. Lhota\u2019s opposition. More than 8 in 10 voters wanted to make affordable housing a top priority, an issue also most associated with Mr. de Blasio.         \n\nVoters said Mr. de Blasio better understood their needs and problems. And, in a troubling sign for Mr. Lhota, voters said that Mr. de Blasio was better equipped to manage the city\u2019s complex government, even though Mr. Lhota was a budget director and a deputy mayor under Mr. Giuliani.
