{"headline": "When Home Is a Campus Parking Lot", "body": "\nC \n I looked over the Craigslist ads, took a bus to John\u2019s used car dealership in Raleigh, N.C., and scanned the rows of sedans, trucks and SUVs in search of my new home.         \n\nAnd there it was. A giant 1994 Ford Econoline coated with a burgundy sheen, the sun turning its black-tinted windows a blinding white. It looked out of place among the shiny, spotless SUVs, whose bumpers proudly faced away, as if exhibiting a juvenile disdain for their ponderous elder. Its distended underbelly hung vulnerably low \u2014 so low I wondered if it would scrape its undercarriage when climbing up and over speed bumps.         \n\nIt was big, it was beautiful and, best of all, it was only $1,500.         \n\nWhile the ad promised that the van \u201cdrives great,\u201d it had more than enough problems to justify its price tag: one of the two side doors wouldn\u2019t open, there were large patches on the windows where the tint had peeled off, and the tires were bald \u2014 so bald that, later on, when I went to buy a part at Sears, a couple of mechanics doubled over in laughter when I asked them if they thought the tires would pass inspection.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take it,\u201d I told John anyway, unable to hold back my grin. Despite its deformities, it was love at first sight.         \n\nI HAD been accepted into \n\u2019s graduate liberal studies program, but I couldn\u2019t afford it. I had just paid off my $32,000 undergraduate debt, I was nearly broke, and the prospect of taking out loans was unthinkable. Going back into debt made about as much sense as running out of a burning building just to run into another.         \n\nToday, the cost of higher education is ridiculous. Average tuition at a public university, in state, is $8,655. At a private, it\u2019s $29,056. My program would cost, in total, a reasonable $11,000 after grant aid. But it\u2019s not just tuition that puts students into debt; it\u2019s room and board. At Duke, where rates are similar to universities across the country, a non-air-conditioned dorm with two roommates costs $5,464 an academic year. The cheapest meal plan for freshmen is a ghastly $5,540, or $27 a day.         \n\nWhen I added up the costs of tuition, books, transportation, food, housing, not to mention car insurance, utilities and, dare I say, a date, I felt hopeless. I had only $4,000 to my name and no possessions except a backpack full of camping gear. But as desperate as I was, I was determined to go back to school.         \n\nWhich brought me back to:  \n         \n\nThe van-dwelling lifestyle, I figured, would eliminate many of the costs. For Internet and electricity, I\u2019d use the library. For showers, I\u2019d buy a cheap campus gym membership. For food, I\u2019d cook my own meals. For rent, well, I wouldn\u2019t have any rent. For dates, well, I probably wouldn\u2019t have any of them, either.         \n\nSeven and a half years before, when I had enrolled at the University at Buffalo as an undergraduate, I wasn\u2019t the sort of person who would have done something as bold and weird and possibly illegal as secretly living in a big creepy van on a college campus. But something had changed on my journey to get out of debt.         \n\nAlong with owing $32,000, I\u2019d graduated with an unmarketable degree in history and English. Naturally, I struggled to find work and wound up taking a $9-an-hour job as a tour guide and cook at a remote truck stop called  \n in Alaska\u2019s Arctic. But while I took the job out of desperation, I\u2019d accidentally placed myself in a near-ideal situation to pay off my debt. In Coldfoot, the nearest store was 250 miles away (eliminating all temptations to buy stuff), there was no cellphone reception (making a phone plan unnecessary), and workers got free room and board (no food, rent or utility costs). After a year, I had paid off $18,000. A year later, I got a better-paying seasonal job with the Park Service. After two and a half years of work, I was debt free.         \n\nBut my journey wasn\u2019t just a financial awakening. I had learned about subsistence living in Arctic villages, and worked with a 74-year-old maintenance man who lived in his 1980 Chevy Suburban year-round. I began to bring into question what passed for \u201cnormal\u201d down in the lower 48, especially when it often led to a lifetime of work, bills and Bed Bath & Beyond purchases. Out of debt, I felt for the first time that my life was my own, and that I could do whatever I wished with it.         \n\nAnd more than anything I wished to use this freedom to continue the liberal arts education that had put me into so much debt. While the cost of my education had chained my ankles to the steel balls of debt, the liberal arts had freed some other part of me. Between a Thor-eauvian van-dwelling experiment and studying the great thinkers, I thought Duke would help me become a better person. Living in a van wouldn\u2019t just be a way for me to afford school. It would be an adventure. It would be my \u201c \n.\u201d         \n\n\u201cCould I live in a van?\u201d I asked myself one last time.  \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/education/edlife/ken-ilgunas-lives-in-a-van-while-a-graduate-student-at-duke-university.html", "date": "2013-04-10", "description": "How I found Thoreau \u2014 and avoided a life of debt-ridden desperation \u2014 by living in my van as a graduate student at Duke University."}
