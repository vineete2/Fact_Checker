{"headline": "Boston Suspect Is Charged and Could Face the Death Penalty", "body": "\nBOSTON \u2014 Lying grievously wounded in a hospital bed, the surviving suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings admitted on Sunday to playing a role in the attacks, said law enforcement officials, and on Monday he was charged with using a weapon of mass destruction that resulted in three deaths and more than 170 injuries.         \n\nUttering the word \u201cno\u201d once, but mostly nodding his responses, the suspect, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, was charged in a brief but dramatic bedside scene in the intensive care ward of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where he is recovering from multiple gunshot wounds sustained during his capture last week.         \n\nMr. Tsarnaev made his admission on Sunday morning to specially trained F.B.I. agents who had been waiting outside his hospital room for him to regain consciousness. After he woke up, they questioned him, invoking what is known as the public safety exception to the Miranda Rule, a procedure authorized by a 1984 U.S. Supreme Court decision which in certain circumstances allows interrogation after an arrest without notifying a prisoner of the right to remain silent.         \n\nIn the course of questioning him about whether he knew of any other active plots or threats to public safety, he admitted that he had been involved in laying the bombs that killed three people at the finish line of the Boston Marathon.         \n\nHe said that he knew of no other plots and that he and his brother had acted alone, and he said he knew of no more bombs that had not been detonated.         \n\nAt the legal hearing Monday, he shook his head in response to most questions. The brief bedside session began when Magistrate Judge Marianne B. Bowler asked a doctor whether Mr. Tsarnaev was alert, according to  \n.         \n\n\u201cYou can rouse him,\u201d the judge told the doctor.         \n\n\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d asked the doctor, identified in the transcript as Dr. Odom. \u201cAre you able to answer some questions?\u201d He nodded.         \n\nJudge Bowler then read Mr. Tsarnaev his rights. Also present were two United States attorneys and three federal public defenders, who will be representing him. Judge Bowler asked if he understood his right to remain silent, to which he nodded affirmatively, according to the transcript.         \n\nThe only word Mr. Tsarnaev uttered, apparently, was \u201cNo,\u201d after he was asked if he could afford a lawyer.         \n\nJudge Bowler said, \u201cLet the record reflect that I believe the defendant has said, \u2018No.\u2019 \u201d         \n\nAt the end of the session, Judge Bowler said: \u201cAt this time, at the conclusion of the initial appearance, I find that the defendant is alert, mentally competent, and lucid. He is aware of the nature of the proceedings.\u201d If convicted, he faces the death penalty or life behind bars.         \n\nMr. Tsarnaev is being treated for what court papers described as possible gunshot wounds to the \u201chead, neck, legs and hand.\u201d One law enforcement officer said the wound to the neck appeared to be the result of a self-inflicted gunshot. The charges were lodged in a criminal complaint unsealed Monday in United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, the first step in a lengthy process.         \n\nThe White House said that Mr. Tsarnaev would not be placed in military detention. \u201cWe will prosecute this terrorist through our civilian system of justice,\u201d said Jay Carney, the White House press secretary.         \n\nHe noted that it was illegal to try an American citizen in a military commission, and that a number of high-profile terrorism cases had been handled in the civilian court system, including that of the  \n with explosives in his underwear.         \n\nThe charges against Mr. Tsarnaev were made public about the same time that Boston, like many cities across the country, held a moment of silence at 2:50 p.m., the time of the explosions a week before. Hundreds of people gathered in Copley Square, near the scene of the attacks, after which church bells tolled mournfully in a cold, wintry wind.         \n\nAlready, hundreds of mourners had attended a funeral at St. Joseph Church in Medford, Mass., for Krystle Campbell, the 29-year-old restaurant manager killed near the finish line of the marathon. In the evening, hundreds more attended a memorial service at Boston University for Lu Lingzi, 23, a Chinese graduate student who was killed in the bombings.         \n\nA service is planned Wednesday for Sean Collier, 27, the M.I.T. campus police officer who was killed in his car Thursday night.
