{"headline": "Who Made That Sippy Cup?", "body": "\n \n         \n\n\u201cMaybe the other engineers were busy at work designing rockets,\u201d Richard Belanger says, \u201cbut I was right in the middle of it.\u201d By \u201cit,\u201d he means the child care duties he shared with his wife in the 1980s. \u201cI had no problem with diapers, but the spills drove me crazy,\u201d Belanger says. Like most parents at that time, Belanger bought a cup with a snap-on lid that was supposed to thwart toddlers. It didn\u2019t work. His son Bryan delighted in foiling the contraption, shaking it upside down until it dribbled on the floor.         \n\nBut Belanger wasn\u2019t just any parent; he was a mechanical engineer. One day in 1988, as Belanger found himself cleaning up a spill again, he thought, How many times am I going to do this? And that\u2019s when he decided to solve the problem for good. \u201cI\u2019m going to see if I can make this thing so it doesn\u2019t leak at all,\u201d he remembers thinking, \u201cand outsmart the child.\u201d         \n\nBelanger had designed hot-glue guns, so he knew a lot about what made a nozzle work. He put together a prototype cup made out of Tupperware parts and added a built-in mouthpiece, experimenting with different kinds of valves until he found one that would let in some air as the child sipped. The air pressure trapped the liquid inside the cup so the nozzle didn\u2019t leak \u2014 even when you held the cup upside down.         \n\nFor a couple of years, the family ran a cottage industry, selling the cups to friends and acquaintances. They even created just-for-fun \u201ccommercials\u201d in which Bryan (and sometimes his younger brother, Steve) hammed it up as they demonstrated the product. The \u201ccompany logo\u201d was baby Bryan in a tux.         \n\nIn the early \u201990s, Belanger negotiated a licensing deal with Playtex. Soon after, the company issued the cups in pink and blue. The Belanger kids ran around at Disney World, peering into strollers, counting up sippies, and calculating how much money \u201cthey\u201d had made. (Nowadays, the original sippy boys work as analysts at Technology Business Research.)         \n\nAnd what about the original sippy cup that Belanger built in the \u201980s? \u201cI\u2019m looking around my office now,\u201d Belanger says of his prototype. \u201cIt\u2019s around here somewhere. The funny thing is, my wife really used it. She\u2019d be pushing Bryan around in his stroller, living her life, taking her son to places, and she used that thing day in and day out. She cleaned it out every night. It was a workhorse.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n That\u2019s right. Most of the injuries were related to falls. Usually the children end up with lacerations on their faces, suggesting that they were walking or running with the product in their mouths.         \n\n \nIt seems fairly clear to us that hard-plastic pieces would be the kind of thing that would most likely cause injuries, as opposed to soft-plastic cups. Recently there have been a couple of product recalls of sippy cups that were marketed around holidays like Easter \u2014 one had a rabbit\u2019s head that stuck up toward the child\u2019s face.         \n\n \nSure. Kids really should transition away from a sippy cup to a regular cup. The family needs to have a place that\u2019s for eating in the house as opposed to roaming everywhere with food and drinks.
