{"headline": "U.S. Is Said to Plan to Send Weapons to Syrian Rebels", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration, concluding that the troops of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria have used chemical weapons against rebel forces in his country\u2019s civil war, has decided to begin supplying the rebels for the first time with small arms and ammunition, according to American officials.         \n\nThe officials held out the possibility that the assistance, coordinated by the Central Intelligence Agency, could include antitank weapons, but they said that for now supplying the antiaircraft weapons that rebel commanders have said they sorely need is not under consideration.         \n\n \n has been a long-sought goal of advocates of a more aggressive American response to the Syrian civil war. A proposal made last year by David H. Petraeus, then the director of the C.I.A., and backed by the State Department and the Pentagon to supply weapons was rejected by the White House because of President Obama\u2019s deep reluctance to be drawn into another war in the Middle East.         \n\nBut even with the decision to supply lethal aid, the Obama administration remains deeply divided about whether to take more forceful action to try to quell the fighting, which has killed more than 90,000 people over more than two years. Many in the American government believe that the military balance has tilted so far against the rebels in recent months that American shipments of arms to select groups may be too little, too late.         \n\nSome senior State Department officials have been pushing for a more aggressive military response, including airstrikes to hit the primary landing strips in Syria that the Assad government uses to launch the chemical weapons attacks, ferry troops around the country and receive shipments of arms from Iran.         \n\nBut White House officials remain wary, and on Thursday Benjamin J. Rhodes, one of Mr. Obama\u2019s top foreign policy advisers, all but ruled out the imposition of a no-fly zone and indicated that no decision had been made on other military actions.         \n\nMr. Obama declared last August that the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government would cross a \u201cred line\u201d that would prompt a more resolute American response. In an April letter to Congress, the White House said that intelligence agencies had \u201cvarying degrees of confidence\u201d that Syrian government troops had used chemical weapons. But the conclusion of the latest intelligence review, according to officials, is more definitive.         \n\nThe White House said on Thursday that the Assad regime had used chemical weapons \u201con a small scale against the opposition multiple times in the last year.\u201d The assessment came after American and European government analysts examined physiological evidence and other intelligence indicating that Syrian troops had used sarin gas against the opposition. The announcement said that American intelligence officials now believed that 100 to 150 people had died from the attacks, but officials cautioned that the number could be higher.         \n\nThat conclusion is based on evidence that includes intelligence on the Assad government\u2019s plans for the use of chemical weapons, accounts of specific attacks, and descriptions of symptoms experienced by victims of the attacks. Mr. Rhodes said the new assessment had changed the president\u2019s calculus.         \n\nBut the president\u2019s caution has frayed relations with important American allies in the Middle East that have privately described the White House strategy as feckless. Saudi Arabia and Jordan recently cut the United States out of a new rebel training program, a decision that American officials said came from the belief in Riyadh and Amman that the United States has only a tepid commitment to supporting rebel groups.         \n\nMoreover, the United Arab Emirates declined to host a meeting of allied defense officials to discuss Syria, concerned that in the absence of strong American leadership the conference might degenerate into bickering and finger-pointing among various gulf nations with different views on the best ways to support the rebellion.
