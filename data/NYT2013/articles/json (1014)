{"headline": "The Most-Wanted Stocking Stuffer: Cash", "body": "\nAll Elizabeth Starkey wants for Christmas is a little help paying her student loans.         \n\nWith a monthly payment topping $1,000, the 31-year-old  \n for Bravo, the cable television network, said even a small contribution would provide some breathing room. \u201cThe only things I really need are a new computer, which is more than anyone wants to spend, or student loan money,\u201d Ms. Starkey said, who owes more than $51,000. \u201cThat is the biggest burden for me, financially, other than rent.\u201d         \n\nSo after she learned about a new service that allows people to send cash gifts to student loan providers, Ms. Starkey alerted her family through her Facebook page and Twitter. But she\u2019s not terribly optimistic they\u2019ll comply. \u201cPeople said, \u2018I want to get you something fun,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cBut I live in New York and I don\u2019t have room for things. I pay $1,023 in student loans and it kills me. Even $100 toward that would be helpful.\u201d         \n\nCash gifts are often written off as too impersonal, or, as in Ms. Starkey\u2019s case, not festive enough. But as you\u2019re scrambling to find the perfect something for a loved one, particularly the students and graduates who collectively hold about  \n in student debt, a little financial wiggle room might be exactly what they want and need.         \n\nBeyond help with student loans, there are a variety of ways to give more personalized money gifts, whether you\u2019re shopping for an aspiring retiree or a young adult. Here are some ideas, with instructions on how to minimize taxes and other unintended consequences.         \n\n \n If you\u2019re not too concerned about exactly how your gift is spent, there\u2019s really nothing easier than old-fashioned cash. Individuals can legally give gifts of up to $14,000 to as many people as they wish in 2013, with no tax consequences. That means a couple could potentially give up to $28,000 per person.         \n\n \n There are a few ways to help graduates chip at debt. Anyone can  \n on behalf of a borrower by check, though you need to know the loan servicer, the borrower\u2019s account number and the monthly payment amount, according to student loan experts.         \n\nA more effective method: Send a letter with your check that states the money should be used to prepay or reduce the principal of the loan, and not for a future loan payment. Also request that the money be applied to the loan with the highest interest rate, if the lender has multiple loans for the borrower, said \n, a senior vice president and publisher of Edvisors, an informational website about paying for college.         \n\nA new service, through  \n, makes this easier since it requires only that you know the gift recipient\u2019s email address. After the gift-giver pays by credit card, the recipient receives a plain or holiday-themed email telling her about the gift, and then directs the recipient to the Tuition.io website, where she enters personal information. Tuition.io, which also offers loan budgeting information, then shuttles the payment to the loan servicer.         \n\nThere are caveats: The gift, limited to a maximum of $500, will apply to future loan payments only (though the company said it\u2019s working on ways to make principal payments). The gift-maker will also be charged a credit card processing fee of 2.9 percent (plus 30 cents), and a 3.5 percent transaction fee. So a $100 gift would amount to $106.70.         \n\n \n Anybody can pay for some or all of a student\u2019s tuition directly, whether it\u2019s a credit hour at a community college or a year at a pricey private school. There are no gift tax implications, as long as the payment is made directly to the institution. The same goes for medical debts.         \n\nBut if you pay a big chunk of college tuition, or even provide a large cash gift, it could hurt the student\u2019s ability to get financial aid. One workaround is to give the cash to the parent, since cash support to parents isn\u2019t reported as untaxed income on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or  \n, and generally has a minimal impact on federal aid, he explained.         \n\n \n All contributions to these state-run, college-savings accounts grow tax-free. And the money can be withdrawn without paying capital gains taxes as long as the proceeds are used for education expenses. A majority of states provide state income tax deductions for contributions, but the rules vary.         \n\nIf you want to make a  \n to an existing account, start by calling the plan for instructions, though you\u2019ll need an account number. That might be easy enough for a grandparent or a close relative to obtain, but it can be a hassle for everyone else.         \n\nServices like  \nand  \n try to make this easier: They allow you to contribute to anyone\u2019s account through a college gift registry. At GiftofCollege, the prospective student needs to be registered on the site to receive a contribution. (It\u2019s currently waiving the 5 percent service fee charged to givers). At GradSave, you can buy a \n even if the recipient doesn\u2019t yet have a 529 account or a registry on the company\u2019s website. The service passes on a 2.9 percent credit card processing fee, though transfers from a checking account are free.         \n\nIf the gift recipient has a 529 plan administered by \n, you can make a contribution through its  \n, which doesn\u2019t charge any fees, and is available in 31 plans in 17 states. The account owners will first need to send family and friends an email invitation to contribute.         \n\nIf you\u2019re a friend or relative who wants to open an account on a child\u2019s behalf, keep in mind that it\u2019s better for the parent to be the account owner with the child named beneficiary \u2014 particularly if the student may be eligible for need-based financial aid.         \n\n\u201c \n should not set up a 529 with themselves as the account owner,\u201d said Mr. Kantrowitz. \u201cSuch a 529 plan will have a harsh impact on eligibility,\u201d he added. Money withdrawn from a grandparent\u2019s account \u2014 or any other friend or relative who is not a parent \u2014 would be treated as untaxed income to the student.         \n\n \n Anyone can open a Roth individual retirement account \u2014 where contributions are made with money that\u2019s been taxed, and withdrawals come out tax-free \u2014 for another person. Adults can also open custodial accounts for children at brokerages like  \n or  \n But if the account owner is over 18, they will need to sign the authorization documents.         \n\nYou can also simply make a gift to an existing account. But the gift recipient will need to have earned income at least equal to the amount of any contributions to the account, said  \n, a principal analyst at CCH Tax & Accounting, and singles must earn less than $127,000. This year, the maximum total contribution to a Roth (or traditional) I.R.A. is $5,500.         \n\n \n Given the stock market\u2019s ascent over the last few years, you may be sitting on stock that has also risen appreciably. If you give those shares to a relative or friend in a lower tax bracket, he can sell them for cash and may pay far less in capital gains taxes than you would. The gift recipient could also use the proceeds to reinvest in broad-based index fund within that new Roth I.R.A. you helped set up.         \n\nBut parents who give stock to younger children may not achieve the same sort of tax savings: The kiddie tax may apply if the child is under age 19, and in some cases up until age 24 if he is a full-time student and still receiving parental support. In that case, the child would still pay capital gains taxes at the parents\u2019 rate, Mr. Luscombe explained.         \n\n \n Maybe a parent has an adult child who needs assistance organizing his financial life because he just experienced a big life event like a marriage or the birth of a child. Or maybe someone wants to send a parent to a  \n as he contemplates the hard questions of retirement. Some advisers offer gift certificates, including planners through the  \n.         \n\n \n, an online financial advisory, offers gift certificates via email. The gift giver can either pay for the setup fee ($399), or an entire package, which includes the fee and an entire year of support.         \n\n \n Helping pay down a loved one\u2019s credit card debt can help ease some stress at the start of the new year.         \n\n\u201cIf someone has $5,000 or less in credit card debt and can add a mere $50 a month to a minimum payment every month until the debt is paid off, depending on the interest rate, you can literally shave off a decade or more from the paydown period and wipe out thousands in extra interest,\u201d said Manisha Thakor, who runs  \n. The same goes for gifting a lump sum. All you need to do is provide a check written to the name of the credit card company with the amount you\u2019d like to give.
