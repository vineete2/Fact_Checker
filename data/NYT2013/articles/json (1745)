{"headline": "When Your Family Is My Family Much Too Often", "body": "\nIn the best of worlds, before marrying, people would discuss their feelings about extended family, like: How many barbecues a month do I really want to spend with my in-laws?         \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t count the number of couples I\u2019ve seen where it seems like someone is still married to their family,\u201d said Winifred M. Reilly, a Berkeley-based therapist who has been practicing for 33 years and writes the blog \n.         \n\nIn this week\u2019s  \n, a couple lived in a house built on the husband\u2019s family land. Over time, the wife found living so close to her in-laws stifling, contributing to the divorce.         \n\n\u201cFor every invitation I declined, four more appeared,\u201d she said.         \n\nBy the time couples visit Ms. Reilly, many have already gone to war over how much family time is too much.         \n\nOne of the first things Ms. Reilly advises is to stop threatening your spouse.         \n\nShe described a husband who would regularly visit his mother on weekends, taking along the couple\u2019s young children. The wife wasn\u2019t invited because her mother-in-law didn\u2019t like her and made it unpleasant for her to be there.         \n\nThe husband said that his wife was being selfish because he wanted the children to have a good relationship with their grandmother. And the wife was angry that he and the children were away so much.         \n\nFirst, Ms. Reilly talked with them about making their points without getting derailed on side issues like whether the wife had a bad temper.         \n\nThe therapist probed for underlying causes.         \n\nIn this case, the wife\u2019s father died when she was young and having her husband leave to visit his mother so often recreated that feeling of loss she had as a child.         \n\nAnd the husband felt he had a special obligation to go because his mother was a widow and needed him.         \n\nHe should some empathy about how emotionally painful it was for her to be left behind; she needed to understand that he was doing the proper thing as a son to visit his mother and was not just escaping his wife.         \n\n\u201cThings get better when people say \u2018I\u2019ve got a dilemma and you\u2019ve got a dilemma\u2019 as opposed to \u2018you should just do what I want.'\u201d         \n\nThe husband came to understand why his leaving was so stressful for his wife; the wife learned to control her feelings of abandonment and articulate why she wanted him and their children home. The two stayed married.         \n\nMs. Reilly recently saw a couple who were battling because the wife\u2019s mother kept giving candy to the grandchildren and letting them stay up late when she was baby-sitting them.         \n\nThe husband wanted his wife to confront her mother, but when she did, the mother disregarded her daughter\u2019s concerns. The husband wanted his wife to \u201clay down the law\u201d and she felt her husband was being too hurtful and heavy-handed. They were stuck.         \n\nThe turning point came when the grandmother bought a toy for the grandchildren even though she was asked not to load them up with gifts.         \n\nThis time, instead of blaming his wife for not standing up to her mother, he asked, \u201cHow do you want to handle this?\u201d         \n\nThrough therapy, the husband realized that pushing and threatening don\u2019t work, Ms. Reilly said. \u201cIt was his way of recognizing that change had to come from her.\u201d         \n\nThat gave the wife an opportunity to take a productive next step, suggesting the two of them talk to her mother. It turned out that the wife liked having her husband present, for moral support.         \n\nThe couple no longer fought about the grandmother\u2019s actions. The grandmother did listen to the couple, and though she occasionally overstepped, her actions didn\u2019t weaken the marriage.
