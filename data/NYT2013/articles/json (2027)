{"headline": "N.F.L. Coaches: In Charge and at Risk", "body": "\nThe day before he had emergency quadruple-bypass surgery in 1998, Dan Reeves relayed his symptoms \u2014 accelerated, burning sensations in his chest and throat \u2014 and asked his doctor if a checkup could wait until after the N.F.L. season.         \n\nThe doctor responded by telling Reeves, who eight years earlier had a procedure to remove arterial blockages, that it was the dumbest request he had ever heard.         \n\n\u201cI was in denial,\u201d  \n said.         \n\nReeves, then 54, had a team to coach, and so he did. He was on the sideline for the Atlanta Falcons that December afternoon in New Orleans but did not return for four weeks, as he recovered from open-heart surgery. His determination to keep going, to ignore his well-being, is common in the demanding world of coaching, a profession stocked with Type A personalities who solve problems by working harder, working longer, working more. Among them are John Fox of the Denver Broncos and Gary Kubiak of the Houston Texans, whose health scares on consecutive days last weekend cast into sharp relief the stresses associated with their jobs.         \n\n \n, 58, complained of dizziness Nov. 2 at a golf course in North Carolina and moved up the aortic valve-replacement surgery he was to have after the season. Kubiak, 52, dropped to his knees while walking off the field at halftime of Sunday\u2019s game against Indianapolis and was found to have had a transient ischemic attack, or a ministroke.         \n\nThe day after Kubiak fell ill, Brian Billick, the former Baltimore Ravens coach, received a text message from one of his daughters.         \n\n\u201cDad,\u201d it read, \u201cpromise me you won\u2019t ever go back to coaching.\u201d         \n\nBillick paces himself better in his job as an analyst for Fox Sports and NFL Network, but Kubiak and Fox may not have that option. They are expected to recover, though it is unclear when they will rejoin their teams.         \n\nDr. Douglas Johnston, a cardiothoracic surgeon at the Cleveland Clinic who had no direct knowledge of Fox\u2019s case, said that patients could usually resume functioning at 99 percent capacity within six weeks of an aortic valve replacement and that he would expect Fox to return with no limitations and more energy because his heart would be operating more efficiently.         \n\nDr. Shazam Hussain, the head of Cleveland Clinic\u2019s stroke program, speaking generally, offered a sanguine outlook for Kubiak but said that a transient ischemic attack could be a warning sign before a major stroke and that he urged his patients to exercise and to limit their intake of salt and fat.         \n\nReeves said he had a transient ischemic attack two days after leaving the hospital following the quadruple bypass. He woke up in the emergency room and asked a nurse to turn on the television for the Falcons\u2019 game in Detroit. Reeves said he could relate to Fox and Kubiak, for reasons beyond the stress.         \n\nFox\u2019s Broncos are zipping toward the playoffs, just as the Falcons were in December 1998, when Reeves wanted to be part of every moment. Reeves empathizes with his former quarterback Kubiak, whose Texans have lost their last six games, because he remembers how hard he worked in 1994, when his Giants lost seven straight.         \n\n\u201cBelieve me, you\u2019re working extra thinking, Gosh, I\u2019ve got to do something; what can I do?\u201d Reeves said. \u201cThe answer is, you do whatever you can.\u201d         \n\nThe popular image of a football coach is also a romanticized one, of valor in sleeping at team headquarters or logging 18-hour workdays. A badge of courage, the former Giants coach Jim Fassel called it.         \n\nThat message is propagated by fans, the news media and even the teams themselves, who applaud the bleary-eyed men who watch one more clip and diagram one more play, all for the greater good of the team. No one brags about working less or sleeping more, about being the fifth coach to arrive every morning and not the first.         \n\n\u201cA lot of the guys just think that there\u2019s not another way, that that\u2019s how you do it, period,\u201d said Rich Brooks, who was plagued by ulcers and other stomach ailments at the beginning of his 18-year coaching tenure at the University of Oregon. \u201cNobody\u2019s had the guts to cut the workdays short or to do it different.\u201d         \n\nBrooks, the Falcons\u2019 defensive coordinator in 1998, filled in for Reeves during his absence.
