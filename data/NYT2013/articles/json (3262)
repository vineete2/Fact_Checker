{"headline": "Ukraine in Turmoil After Leaders Reject Major E.U. Deal", "body": "\nKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 Yuri V. Lutsenko, a onetime field commander of Ukraine\u2019s 2004 Orange Revolution, looked out across the tens of thousands of people who gathered on Sunday to protest the government\u2019s decision to back away from a far-reaching political and trade deal with the European Union. Standing onstage under an ash-streaked sky, Mr. Lutsenko felt a powerful sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu \u2014 and a deep need to apologize.         \n\n\u201cI am sure that every person who stood at the glorious Orange Square nine years ago has to do the same,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cI would like you to accept my personal apologies for what was not finished.\u201d         \n\nFor the second time in a decade, Ukraine is in turmoil, with tens of thousands of protesters in recent days loudly demanding that the country shake off its post-Soviet identity and move once and for all into the orbit of a more prosperous Europe.         \n\nThey exploded in anger last week when their leaders, buckling under pressure from Moscow, said they would walk away from a deal that many here, especially the young, see as a vital step in escaping the clutches of the Kremlin and joining fellow ex-satellite countries of Eastern Europe on a path to modernization and greater wealth.         \n\nAt stake here is not just the fate of a free-trade pact but whether the hardball tactics of Russia, willing to use every bit of economic muscle \u2014 including trade threats and its stranglehold on energy supplies \u2014 to exert blunt force in negotiations, will prevail over the national aspirations of millions of people.         \n\nThe effort to draw in Ukraine and other ex-Soviet republics is also crucial to Europe, which has invested heavily in it and can ill afford a humiliating defeat at a time when its stature is already being called into doubt by the continuing economic strains within the euro zone.         \n\nCalls for Europe to answer the Kremlin\u2019s threats of retaliatory sanctions against Ukraine with sanctions against Russia are raising the prospect of a bitter trade war that could complicate numerous efforts by Western powers to cooperate with Russia on security matters.         \n\n\u201cRussia really depends on the E.U. buying gas and all this other stuff, \u201c said Andreas Umland, who teaches political science at Kyiv-Mohyla Academy here. \u201cThe E.U. has leverage.\u201d         \n\nWith street protests continuing in Kiev and cities across the country on Tuesday, there was a distinct sense that Ukraine has been here before. More than 20 years after declaring its freedom and hastening the collapse of the Soviet Union, the country of 46 million remains caught between Russia and the West, its aspirations for independence upended by the rivalries of bigger powers, its domestic politics riven by corruption, violence, revenge and ethno-regional strife, its people impoverished and fearful about the future.         \n\nMany Ukrainians say they regard the country\u2019s political leaders since the end of the Soviet era to be a collective failure. At the same time, they say they recognize the constraints of being almost entirely dependent on Russia for energy, especially natural gas for heat, as well as the historic burden of being home to vital Russian military assets, including major installations for its Black Sea fleet.         \n\n\u201cThe foundation has to be completely changed in our country, so that it would not remain a post-Soviet barrack temporarily repainted in yellow and blue,\u201d Mr. Lutsenko told the crowd, referring to the colors of the country\u2019s flag. \u201cWe have to understand that not only the president has to be changed but the entire system.\u201d         \n\nMr. Lutsenko knows the perils of the system well. From his role as field commander, he went on to serve as a leader in Parliament and as the interior minister, under President Viktor A. Yushchenko, who was poisoned by dioxin in an assassination attempt during the disputed 2004 election. After Viktor F. Yanukovich, the revolution\u2019s antihero, won the presidency in 2010, Mr. Lutsenko was arrested and jailed on abuse of authority charges, only to be  \n as Mr. Yanukovich came under pressure from the West.         \n\nSupporters of European integration had been pinning their hopes on the political and trade agreements, which had been in the works for more than four years, and Mr. Yanukovich had long talked about signing them at a major conference that begins on Thursday in Vilnius, Lithuania.         \n\nIn contrast with 2004, they say they are focused entirely on raising standards of living, and putting Ukraine on track to become a member of the European Union so they could obtain the benefits that they see are now enjoyed by neighboring Poland and by the fellow ex-Soviet republics in the Baltics.
