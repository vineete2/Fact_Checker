{"headline": "Rake the Leaves? Some Towns Say Mow Them", "body": "\nDOBBS FERRY, N.Y. \u2014 They have been burned, blown into piles, raked into bags and generally scorned by homeowners everywhere. Fall leaves \u2014 so pretty on the trees, such a nuisance when they hit the ground \u2014 have long been a thing to be discarded. But now some suburban towns are asking residents to do something radical: Leave the leaves alone.         \n\nIn the past few years, lawn signs have sprouted in this Hudson River village and across Westchester County, proclaiming the benefits of mulching the leaves in place, rather than raking them up and taking them away. The technique involves mowing the leaves with special mulching blades, which shred them into tiny bits. That allows them to quickly decompose and naturally feed lawns and shrubs.         \n\nOfficials are encouraging the practice for its cost savings: Westchester spends $3.5 million a year on private contractors who haul away leaves in tractor-trailers and bring them to commercial composting sites in places like Orange County, N.Y., and Connecticut. At the same time, environmental groups and horticulturalists are praising the practice\u2019s sustainability, devising slogans like \u201cLeave Leaves Alone\u201d and  \n         \n\nKaren Engelmann, a novelist in Dobbs Ferry, used to rake up the leaves on her half-acre property, which is laced with old oak trees. She once had 120 bags of leaves lined up at her curb to be taken away by the village. \u201cI wondered, \u2018Where do these go?\u2019\u00a0\u201d she recalled. \u201cI thought it was odd that there wasn\u2019t an alternative, that there wasn\u2019t someone saying you might want to think about how the planet functions.\u201d         \n\nIt turned out that her landscaper, Tim Downey, had started experimenting with the new technique. On an unseasonably warm afternoon last week, he navigated his mulching mower over a thick pile of leaves, producing a fine layer of confetti. Mr. Downey said the mulched leaves improve the soil\u2019s water retention and provide critical nutrients, reducing the need for fertilizer in the spring.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s utterly insane to be driving tractor-trailers 90 miles away,\u201d said Mr. Downey, owner of Aesthetic Landscape Care in Hastings-on-Hudson. \u201cMy feeling is that if I\u2019m taking away your leaves, I\u2019m stealing from your property.\u201d         \n\nIndeed, commercial firms use fall leaves as a raw material to produce mulch and compost for sale to nurseries. But towns and counties pay to get rid of them. In Westchester, for instance, the county pays a private hauler about $40 for every ton of leaves that it takes away. Municipalities that provide leaf pickup service pay the county $15 a ton. So some county residents ultimately foot the bill through both municipal and county taxes.         \n\nCounty officials say mulching leaves in place not only improves soil quality, but also has other environmental and safety benefits for communities. Piles of leaves left at the curb can clog storm drains; the nitrogen and phosphorous leaching from decomposing leaves heaped by the street can also more easily enter the drains and harm local rivers. Additionally, leaf piles constrict already narrow streets and can conceal children.         \n\nWestchester County appears to be in the vanguard on leaf mulching, but there are nascent steps in New Jersey and Connecticut to reduce leaf collections. For the first time this fall, the city of Englewood, N.J., which estimates that between overtime, equipment maintenance and fees, it spends $200,000 a year on leaf removal, is pushing the idea in emails and a newsletter. \u201cLeaves clog storm drains, they\u2019re slippery and they can catch on fire when cars park on top of them,\u201d said Kevin Lake, a member of the city\u2019s Environmental Commission.         \n\nPublic service announcements and mulching workshops in Westchester have nudged homeowners to buy mulching attachments for their mowers and impelled landscapers to offer the service. But it is not always an easy sell.         \n\nFor those who do it themselves, the mulching attachments can be cumbersome. And then there is the aesthetic factor. \u201cPeople want everything removed from their lawn, and landscapers just want to keep their customers happy,\u201d said Marianne Petronella, director of resource management for Westchester County\u2019s Environmental Facilities Department. \u201cI know some residents would never do mulching in place. They want to keep up with the Joneses.\u201d         \n\nStephen J. Edwards, the director of public works in Westport, Conn., agreed. \u201cUnfortunately, people are just very conscious of the appearance of the lawn, and they want to see it spotless all the time,\u201d he said, adding that the town spent $85,000 to take residents\u2019 leaves away. Still, he said, Westport encourages leaf composting, especially for some of the one- to two-acre properties in the northern part of town. \u201cResidents can blow the leaves into big piles and Mother Nature does the work,\u201d he said.         \n\nTwo years ago, Ms. Petronella enlisted a landscaper who mulches leaves and tried it on her own property in Scarsdale, which she described as a \u201cpostage stamp.\u201d There was leafy residue for a few days after the mowers came through, but it quickly disappeared. \u201cMy land is just as attractive as any of my neighbors\u2019 and I didn\u2019t turn on my sprinklers once the past two summers, not once,\u201d Ms. Petronella said.         \n\nThe holdouts are not convinced. In Hastings-on-Hudson, Chloe Sikirica, a 50-year-old artist, was blowing leaves off her yard. With twin boys, she worries about the leaf confetti. \u201cIf you shred them and leave them, then the kids will track the mulch into the house,\u201d she said.         \n\nHer one nod to sustainable yard care: leaving leaves around her trees and hedges to provide a natural mulch.         \n\nIn northern Westchester, Fiona Mitchell of Bedford is a mulching convert. A member of the board of her local library, Ms. Mitchell got the idea a few years ago when the library was facing budget cuts. \u201cI said, \u2018Hang on, we\u2019re spending all this money on leaves,\u2019\u00a0\u201d she remembered.         \n\nBedford estimates that 10 workers and 10 vehicles are needed over six weeks to pick up leaf bags and suck up piles of leaves from curbs; unlike other towns, it composts them on site, so it does not pay for hauling.         \n\nNow Ms. Mitchell does her own leaves, switching the blades on her mower come fall. She said the leaves provide so much benefit to her soil that this fall she \u201cborrowed\u201d some from her neighbor to mulch. And she has become something of a proselytizer for the practice among her neighbors and those in other towns.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m becoming a bit of a mulching police,\u201d she said. \u201cMy friends call out, \u2018I\u2019m mulching, I\u2019m mulching,\u2019 when I walk by their houses.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/25/nyregion/rake-the-leaves-some-towns-say-mow-them.html", "date": "2013-11-24", "description": "Officials in some New York counties say mulching leaves in place improves soil quality, saves municipal transport costs and has other environmental and safety benefits for communities."}
