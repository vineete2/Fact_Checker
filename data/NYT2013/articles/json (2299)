{"headline": "New Laws Ban Most Abortions in North Dakota", "body": "\nFARGO, N.D. \u2014 Gov. Jack Dalrymple of North Dakota approved the nation\u2019s toughest abortion restrictions on Tuesday, signing into law a measure that would ban nearly all abortions and inviting a legal showdown over just how much states can limit access to the procedure.         \n\nMr. Dalrymple, a Republican, signed three bills passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature in Bismarck. The most far-reaching law forbids abortion once a fetal heartbeat is \u201cdetectable,\u201d which can be as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. Fetal heartbeats are detectable at that stage of pregnancy using a transvaginal ultrasound.         \n\nMost legal scholars have said the law would violate the Supreme Court\u2019s finding in Roe v. Wade that abortions were permitted until the fetus was viable outside the womb, generally around 24 weeks. Even some leaders of the anti-abortion movement nationally have predicted that laws banning abortion so early in pregnancy are virtually certain to be declared unconstitutional by federal courts.         \n\n\u201cAlthough the likelihood of this measure surviving a court challenge remains in question, this bill is nevertheless a legitimate attempt by a state legislature to discover the boundaries of Roe v. Wade,\u201d Mr. Dalrymple said in a statement. The Supreme Court, he added, \u201chas never considered this precise restriction\u201d in the heartbeat bill.         \n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of frustration in the pro-life movement,\u201d said Paul B. Linton, a constitutional lawyer in Illinois who was formerly general counsel of Americans United for Life. \u201cForty years after Roe v. Wade was decided, it\u2019s still the law of the land.\u201d         \n\nThe new laws place North Dakota, for the moment at least, at the center of sharp efforts in several Republican-controlled states to curb abortion rights. Three weeks ago, Arkansas lawmakers adopted what at the time was the country\u2019s most stringent  \n, also tied to detection of a fetal heartbeat and banning the procedure at 12 weeks of pregnancy. That is the point at which a heartbeat can be detected using an abdominal ultrasound.         \n\nThe Arkansas and North Dakota laws have offered the first victories for an emerging faction of the anti-abortion movement that is frustrated by the limited progress in curbing abortions and hopes that the Supreme Court might be ready for a radical rethinking.         \n\nBut that approach has caused divisions within the movement, with Mr. Linton and others calling it wishful thinking         \n\nThe North Dakota fetal heartbeat law and others like it, Mr. Linton said, \u201chave no chance in the courts.\u201d         \n\nAbortion-rights advocates who had gathered here to urge the governor to veto the bills quickly condemned his decision as effectively banning abortion in the state and as an attack on women. Without judicial intervention, the three bills are scheduled to take effect Aug. 1.         \n\n\u201cIn the past it\u2019s been, \u2018We\u2019re going to try and make it more difficult, more hoops, more obstacles for women to have to jump through or jump over,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Tammi Kromenaker, the director of Red River Women\u2019s Clinic in Fargo, the state\u2019s only abortion provider. \u201cBut this is specifically: \u2018Let\u2019s ban abortion. Let\u2019s do it. Let\u2019s challenge Roe v. Wade. Let\u2019s end abortion in North Dakota.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nThe  \n, in New York, immediately condemned the new laws and said it would file a challenge to the fetal heartbeat ban.         \n\nMr. Dalrymple also affirmed a law to require doctors performing abortions to get admitting privileges at a local hospital, which could force the closing of the Red River clinic. A similar law adopted by Mississippi last year is under challenge in federal court.         \n\nHe also signed a third law that would prevent abortion in cases of gender preference or \u2014 the first of its kind in the nation \u2014 genetic defects, like Down syndrome.         \n\nThe signings come on top of a resolution approved by the North Dakota Legislature last week to amend the State Constitution to assert that life begins at conception, a move that would give a fetus the rights of a person and outlaw virtually all abortions. The so-called personhood measure, asserting that \u201cthe inalienable right to life of every human being at any stage of development must be recognized and defended,\u201d will go on the ballot next year. Such measures have been voted down in Mississippi and Colorado.         \n\nMr. Dalrymple acted on the measures less than 24 hours after they were advanced to his desk.         \n\nSimilar measures to ban abortions when fetal heartbeats are detected are under consideration in several other states, including Kansas and Ohio.
