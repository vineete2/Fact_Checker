{"headline": "The Big Stories Then in the Clear Light of Now", "body": "\nDan Rather called it \u201cthe most watched load of garbage in the memory of man.\u201d         \n\nIt was 1987. A small town businessman had what seemed like a promising idea, to transport New York trash by barge to a landfill in North Carolina, where it would be converted into methane to heat homes.         \n\nAnd then the news media latched on to the story. Suddenly the transport of a 3,000-ton load of normal garbage became a tale of a toxic cargo set loose upon the open seas. For five months, news helicopters recorded the barge\u2019s every move, as it was turned away by scared government officials in six states and three countries. \u201cThe Barge to No Where.\u201d \u201cThe Gar-barge.\u201d         \n\nIn a new online video feature, \u201cRetro Report,\u201d we revisit the story, 25 years later, to discover that little of what we thought we knew was true. Environmentalists and government regulators explain that the Gar-barge was actually a smart idea that made business and ecological sense. Transporting waste long distances has become routine, with tens of thousands of tons leaving New York City transfer stations every day for landfills all over the East. Some countries in Europe can\u2019t find enough garbage to burn in their energy plants, and officials in Norway are actually contemplating  \nby \u2014 you can\u2019t makes this stuff up \u2014 ocean-going ships.         \n\nThis 12-minute video is the first in a weekly series that will re-examine the leading stories of decades past. The series is a collaboration between The Times and  \n, a documentary news organization formed last year.         \n\nHaving watched several Retro Report videos, I can tell you that the headline-grabbers of the 1980s and 1990s that I thought I knew, I didn\u2019t, and that just because the news media lost interest long ago doesn\u2019t mean that the story is over. In a coming Retro Report on crack babies \u2014 infants born to addicted mothers \u2014 we learn that warnings in the 1980s about these children being damaged for life were not supported by the research of the time or by more recent studies. We meet a former crack baby who is now a successful college graduate, with a family of her own. Another video examines the story of Tawana Brawley and her chief supporter, Al Sharpton, who put forth a story of racial violence that turned out to be false and hurt many innocent people. There are video reports on the Tailhook military sexual abuse scandal and the Y2K panic.         \n\nThe Retro Report documentary project was conceived of by Christopher Buck, a former television editor whose father was a co-founder of the Subway restaurant chain. Started with a grant from Mr. Buck, Retro Report is a nonprofit online video news organization that aims to provide a thoughtful counterweight to today\u2019s chew-it-up, spit-it-out 24/7 news cycle. Kyra Darnton, a former producer for \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d is Retro Report\u2019s managing editor, overseeing a staff of 12 journalists and 6 contributors who have worked for PBS, CNN, ABC and several newspapers including the The New York Times and Newsday.         \n\nWe live at a time when news comes hurtling at us in 140-character spurts via Twitter and even a sentence this short is too long for one news tweet.         \n\nIf it is true that journalism is the first draft of history, then like any first draft, it needs fact-checking, which is what we hope to do with our weekly Retro reports.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/06/booming/new-video-series-re-examines-garbage-barge-fiasco.html", "date": "2013-05-06", "description": "In this first Retro Report video, a reviled garbage barge that became an international media story in 1987 is found to have simply been ahead of its time."}
