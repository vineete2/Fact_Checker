{"headline": "Aleppo Pounded, Rebels Weigh U.S. Vow of Aid", "body": "\nCAIRO \u2014 As a group of rebels gathered in an apartment in Aleppo, Syria\u2019s largest city, debating the value of the United States\u2019 decision to provide them with weapons, government forces nearby began pounding an opposition-held neighborhood.         \n\nThe opposing events led the group to focus on a question asked on Friday by many in Syria\u2019s beleaguered opposition: Would the promised aid come in time, or would be it be too little, too late?         \n\nAn older rebel who leads a few dozen fighters on one of the front lines in Aleppo was skeptical. \u201cI\u2019ll believe that America is helping us when I see American arms in my group\u2019s hands, not statements and food baskets,\u201d said the 40-year-old fighter, who calls himself Abu Zaki. \u201cWe will accept all support even from Satan to finish the Assad regime, then we will not forget those who stand and support us and who stand and support the regime.\u201d         \n\nAt the same time, he said, he did not understand American fears that arms would go to Al Nusra Front, a rebel group linked to Al Qaeda, since it had never attacked Western targets.         \n\nThe announcement on Thursday that the United States concluded that the forces of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, had used chemical weapons and that President Obama was now prepared to send light arms and ammunition to the rebels, set off a similar debate around the world. Allies and adversaries of the Syrian president argued whether the decision would help speed the end of the conflict, or serve only to escalate the bloodshed.         \n\n\u201cWhat are we going to do about the fact that in our world today there is a dictatorial and brutal leader who is using chemical weapons under our noses against his own people?\u201d Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain asked in an interview with the newspaper The Guardian.         \n\nBritain said Friday that it would confer with American and French leaders, with some of those discussions occurring at a Group of 8 summit meeting next week in Northern Ireland that the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, would attend. Germany called for an urgent meeting of the United Nations Security Council.         \n\nBut President Assad\u2019s allies in Russia and Iran condemned the decision, and the leader of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, vowed to continue fighting on behalf of the Syrian government \u201cwherever needed.\u201d         \n\nIn a telephone call on Friday, the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, told Secretary of State John Kerry that Washington\u2019s allegations about chemical weapons \u201cwere not supported by reliable evidence,\u201d according to a Russian Foreign Ministry statement. Mr. Lavrov said American support for the opposition risked escalation in the region.         \n\nThe Syrian government said the American reports about chemical weapons use were \u201cfull of lies\u201d and paved the way for intervention.         \n\n\u201cThe United States is using cheap tactics to justify President Barack Obama\u2019s decision to arm the Syrian opposition,\u201d Syria\u2019s Foreign Ministry said in a statement.         \n\nSyria\u2019s conflict began in March 2011 with protests calling for political reform. Since then, it has evolved into a civil war, with armed brigades fighting Mr. Assad\u2019s forces across the country.         \n\nThe war, which the United Nations said Thursday has  \n, has accented sectarian divisions inside Syria and across the Middle East.         \n\nThe rebels mostly hail from Syria\u2019s Sunni Muslim majority and are primarily backed by the Sunni monarchies of Qatar and Saudi Arabia.         \n\nMr. Assad\u2019s government has long given privilege to members of his Alawite minority and is backed by the region\u2019s Shiites, including Iran and the Lebanese group Hezbollah. Their strategic alliance allows Iran to use Syria as a crucial land link for the delivery of weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon.         \n\nInside Syria, the news of American aid energized antigovernment activists in Aleppo. The rebels had blasted into Aleppo almost a year ago, energized and eager to occupy the most populous city and a commercial center. But the government fought back and the rebels stalled.         \n\nThe city is now roughly divided between government- and rebel-controlled neighborhoods and the differences in each are clear to residents.
