{"headline": "If Patriots Have Plan for Tebow, It\u2019s a Secret", "body": "\nFOXBOROUGH, Mass. \u2014  \n smirked when he observed the unusually large news media contingent gathered for the start of the  \n\u2019 three-day minicamp.         \n\nBelichick\u2019s brief opening statement made no mention of  \n, the player whose signing was the cause of all the commotion, but he didn\u2019t have to wait long for the subject to come up. Tebow, the N.F.L.\u2019s most famous and polarizing backup quarterback, officially became a member of the Patriots on Tuesday, and the franchise quickly got a taste of the fascination that seems to follow Tebow even when on-field success in the N.F.L. eludes him.         \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a talented guy, he\u2019s smart, he works hard,\u201d Belichick said numerous times, in response to repeated questions about Tebow and what his role with the Patriots might be.         \n\nFinally, more than 10 questions into his news conference and with no end to the queries about Tebow in sight, Belichick simply said, \u201cI think we\u2019ve already talked enough about him.\u201d         \n\nDespite the repeated questions and the crush of news media, Tebow\u2019s arrival at his latest stop stood in stark contrast to the carnival-like atmosphere that surrounded his trade to  \n before last season. Then, Tebow was asked to give a formal news conference, which was attended by about 200 members of the news media; the scale of the event immediately created the impression that he was in town to claim the starting quarterback job from Mark Sanchez.         \n\nOn Tuesday, instead of a news conference, Tebow spoke for only 32 seconds. He did not take questions.         \n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, I want to thank the Patriots for giving me an opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m very thankful. It\u2019s going to be a lot of fun.\u201d         \n\nHe added: \u201cI look forward to working hard every single day and getting a lot better and learning under some great people. That\u2019s all I got. Thank you all so much and God bless. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be talking again soon.\u201d         \n\nIn New England, Tebow, 25, will be reunited with the offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels, who was the coach of the Denver Broncos three seasons ago when the Broncos drafted Tebow. A year later, with a series of improbable comebacks, Tebow led the team to the playoffs and then to a wild-card victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers. Tebow passed for a career-high 316 yards and 2 touchdowns in that victory, but he was shut down by New England a week later in a 45-10 loss. He was dealt to the Jets for fourth- and sixth-round draft choices after Denver signed Peyton Manning that off-season.         \n\nDespite the initial excitement his arrival in New York generated, his season with the Jets was a bust. He did not produce a touchdown, completing just 6 of 8 passes for 39 yards, carrying 32 times for 102 yards and serving as a punt protector. Questions about his role in the Jets\u2019 offense became a distraction, especially as Sanchez struggled and the Jets failed to make the playoffs.         \n\nThere is no question who will be the Patriots\u2019 starting quarterback:  \n, a two-time Super Bowl most valuable player who turns 36 in August. Tebow will wear No. 5 instead of the No. 15 he wore in Denver and New York, because Brady\u2019s backup, Ryan Mallett, has claim to that number. But Belichick has long been an admirer of the spread offense that Tebow ran in college at Florida.         \n\nThere are serious questions about whether Tebow can be an effective N.F.L. quarterback, but Belichick has shown a willingness throughout his career to use players in unorthodox ways. Wide receivers Troy Brown, Julian Edelman and Matthew Slater all played well when pressed into service as defensive backs. The former linebacker Mike Vrabel emerged as a goal-line threat at tight end.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reason why he\u2019s here,\u201d tight end Aaron Hernandez said of Tebow, his former teammate at Florida. \u201cI actually don\u2019t know the reason yet, but we\u2019ll see. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be doing a few things here. That\u2019s up to Bill Belichick.\u201d         \n\nThe former N.F.L. general manager Charley Casserly said Belichick may value the strong and elusive Tebow for his ability to serve as a read-option quarterback since the Patriots lacked that increasingly popular element in practice and games. Whatever the opportunity, Casserly emphasized that Tebow must capitalize.         \n\n\u201cThis is maybe beyond his last shot,\u201d he said.         \n\nTebow, working as the third quarterback Tuesday, was held out of 7-on-7 drills. He completed 4 of 7 passes when he took the field with reserves at the end of practice. Belichick was noncommital about whether Tebow would continue at quarterback or be tried at another position, saying, \u201cWe will see.\u201d         \n\nBelichick also did not seem concerned that Tebow\u2019s presence might become a distraction.         \n\n\u201cHopefully, there will be more than that at the games on Sundays,\u201d he said when asked about the number of people who turned out Tuesday.         \n\nDuring Belichick\u2019s time in New England, he has taken chances on several players, including receivers Randy Moss and Chad Ochocinco, who were essentially discarded by other teams. And while Tebow is more than a season removed from his last success as a quarterback, those familiar with Belichick\u2019s mind-set said this latest move was more than a publicity stunt.         \n\n\u201cYou see the way the Jets handle things; some of the things they do are more media-driven,\u201d said Brown, a member of the Patriots from 1993 to 2007. \u201cIn New England, we get our press by what we do on the field, not what we say in a press conference.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/12/sports/football/tebows-debut-with-patriots-reveals-little.html", "date": "2013-06-11", "description": "Tim Tebow was at the start of a Patriots\u2019 three-day minicamp, but Coach Bill Belichick did not say how he planned to use him."}
