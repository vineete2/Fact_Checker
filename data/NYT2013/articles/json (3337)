{"headline": "One Last Cringe for \u2018The Office\u2019 Finale", "body": "\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Sometime in Season 3 of  \n its creator, Greg Daniels, conceived the premise for what would be the show\u2019s finale.         \n\nNot the actual documentary about the Dunder-Mifflin paper company of Scranton, Pa., that a fictional camera crew shot for what turned out to be nine years, he decided \u2014 but a reunion show, in the fashion of the post-competition cast rehashes familiar from reality shows like  \n         \n\n\u201cAt one point I actually approached Jeff Probst,\u201d the host of \u201cSurvivor,\u201d Mr. Daniels whispered as the big reunion scene unfolded here in the auditorium of an AT&T office building. Standing in for the Scranton cultural center, it was one of many locations for the ambitious one-hour finale, to be shown on May 16 on NBC.         \n\nOnstage at the reunion were most of the prominent characters \u2014 minus the biggest one,  \n\u2019s Michael Scott \u2014 arrayed in a long arc of folding chairs. They were answering questions about\u00a0how the documentary, supposedly recently presented on Scranton\u2019s PBS affiliate, had changed their (fictional) lives.         \n\nWhy PBS? \u201cI tried to think what outlet would shoot something like this and take nine years to do it,\u201d Mr. Daniels said.         \n\nThat idea is almost as improbable as the notion that a comedy adapted from a British sitcom and initially poised for oblivion (after NBC\u2019s screening of the pilot, it was headed for exile on Bravo, one executive related) would become a bellwether of many of the changes that have overtaken television today.         \n\nAs the anchor of NBC\u2019s once-heralded Thursday-night lineup, it played a role in pioneering alternative entertainment forms like TV offerings on iTunes and Webisodes on the Internet. It helped executives recognize the value of delayed viewing. Equally important, it opened broadcast television to a new concept in humor: the sitcom that makes you uncomfortable.         \n\n\u201c \n,\u201d never qualified as a blockbuster hit (though it attracted one of the most affluent audiences in television). Yet it clearly paved the way for a style of filmed comedy \u2014 smart, multilayered and subtle, sometimes so much so that a portion of viewers never understood its humor. The genre has since been embodied by other highly regarded comedies like \u201c \n,\u201d \u201c \n,\u201d  \n and  \n (starring an \u201cOffice\u201d graduate,  \n).         \n\nThe show also had striking worldwide appeal. The  \n, starring Ricky Gervais, has been copied in places as disparate as Chile and France, proving that office life under a bumptious boss is apparently universal. \u201c\u00a0\u2018The Office\u2019 was like a high-wire act,\u201d said Ken Kwapis, the show\u2019s first and last director. He cited, among other things, the absence of a laugh track, the exclusion of any kind of background music and a completely untraditional filming style.         \n\n\u201cSome of the things most compelling about the show aren\u2019t even funny,\u201d Mr. Kwapis said. \u201cBut they make you cringe. Now I go to pitch meetings where executives say, \u2018I want that cringe-worthy comedy.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nThat any of this happened is mind-boggling for almost everyone who was involved at the show\u2019s inception, beginning with Ben Silverman, the executive producer (and later, head of NBC\u2019s entertainment division), who chased Mr. Gervais all over London to secure the American rights. \u201cWhat was required to get this show on was almost herculean,\u201d Mr. Silverman said.         \n\nThe NBC chief executive at the time, Jeff Zucker, had proclaimed that no single-camera comedy could ever be a hit show. (Single-camera shows are shot on sets and locations and feel like movies; three-camera comedies like  \n are shot on stages in front of audiences and feel like theater.) Mr. Zucker was not an initial fan of NBC\u2019s version of \u201cThe Office,\u201d and he wasn\u2019t alone. \u201cA lot of people didn\u2019t get it,\u201d Mr. Daniels said.         \n\n \n, who memorably inhabited the show\u2019s male romantic lead, Jim, recalled that during the shooting of the first six episodes, a network executive would show up every Friday and say, \u201cThis episode is so good \u2014 unfortunately, it\u2019s the last one we\u2019re going to do.\u201d         \n\nExpectations among critics were also low because the British version, created by Mr. Gervais and Stephen Merchant, had been deemed an instant classic, and NBC had misfired two seasons earlier in a remake of the British comedy \u201c \n.\u201d Mr. Daniels recalled watching the British \u201cOffice,\u201d with its ironic tone, and thinking, \u201cOh my God, how did they pull this off?\u201dA breakthrough came when Mr. Daniels realized that between Americans\u2019 newborn fascination with reality shows and their growing habit of recording even mundane events in their own daily lives, \u201cbeing in front of a camera and talking to a camera became a most relatable experience.\u201d         \n\nThe idea of allowing characters to speak directly to the camera, another device straight out of \u201cSurvivor,\u201d also opened up possibilities, Mr. Daniels said, because \u201cyou can tell stories in a first-person point of view.\u201d That technique is now commonplace on shows like \u201cModern Family\u201d and countless commercials.         \n\nWith his own experience in the reality genre, Mr. Silverman reached out to camera operators with reality-television credits to film the pilot. To direct, Mr. Daniels hired Mr. Kwapis, who had cut his teeth on observational single-camera comedies like  \n and especially  \n And Mr. Kwapis brought in Peter Smokler, who had worked on the beloved mockumentary \u201cThis Is Spinal Tap,\u201d as director of photography.         \n\nCasting also required new thinking. \u201cThe actors who were workers at Dunder-Mifflin had to look, frankly, like people who don\u2019t belong on prime-time television,\u201d Mr. Kwapis said.
