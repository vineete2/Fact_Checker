Picks Tokyo, Considered Safe Choice", "body": "\nBUENOS AIRES \u2014 Tokyo was selected Saturday to host the 2020 Summer Olympics in what was considered a safe rather than transformative choice in a time of political and economic uncertainty around the globe.         \n\nAfter Japan\u2019s prime minister gave an emphatic assurance of safety regarding the country\u2019s 2011 nuclear disaster and continuing concerns about radioactivity, Tokyo easily defeated Istanbul and Madrid to be named host of the Summer Games for a second time.         \n\n\u201cWhen I heard the name Tokyo, I was so touched, overwhelmed,\u201d said Shinzo Abe, Japan\u2019s prime minister. \u201cThe joy was even greater than when I won my own election.\u201d         \n\nThe decision was met with elation in Japan, where it was seen as a vote of international support for the nation\u2019s efforts to pull itself out of a long economic and political decline and to overcome the devastating earthquake, tsunami and nuclear accident two years ago.         \n\nWinning the Games also appeared to affirm Abe\u2019s efforts to restore Japan\u2019s confidence at a time when it has appeared increasingly eclipsed by neighboring China.         \n\n\u201cJapan has seemed to be overshadowed by the rise of China and other developing nations,\u201d said Harumi Arima, an independent political analyst. \u201cThese Olympics will give Japanese a chance to feel reborn, to feel for themselves that Japan can still be vibrant.\u201d         \n\nFor the International Olympic Committee, environmental concerns in Japan appeared less urgent than the Syrian war on Turkey\u2019s border, a harsh crackdown against antigovernment protesters recently in Istanbul and Spain\u2019s economic recession and high unemployment.         \n\nThe Olympic movement has also been buffeted by protests in Brazil over heavy government spending for the 2014 World Cup and the  \n, to be held in Rio de Janeiro. And there has been criticism of what the West considers antigay legislation passed in Russia ahead of the 2014 Winter Olympics in the Black Sea resort city\u00a0Sochi, a Games that will come with a $50 billion price tag.         \n\nAmid such economic, political and human rights maelstroms, Tokyo was seen as a calm harbor. It won handily over Istanbul in the second round of voting, 60-36, in a secret ballot of Olympic delegates.         \n\nTokyo presented its bid as a \u201csafe pair of hands,\u201d an appeal that clearly resonated with Olympic officials.         \n\n\u201cThis is something that appeals to me as a surgeon,\u201d said Jacques Rogge, the president of the Olympic committee and a retired orthopedist from Belgium, who did not vote Saturday, as is tradition.         \n\nTokyo hosted the 1964 Summer Olympics, and Japan has twice hosted the Winter Games, in Sapporo in 1972 and in Nagano in 1998. Japan also hosted the 2002 World Cup with South Korea and has repeatedly shown it can organize the world\u2019s largest sporting events. It has a reserve fund worth $4.5 billion to build stadiums for the 2020 Games.         \n\n\u201cThe members wanted to have a choice between a bid addressing tradition and stability and another bid that was addressing new projects,\u201d said Thomas Bach, an I.O.C. delegate from Germany who is expected to succeed Rogge as president. \u201cIn today\u2019s political and economic situation, the clear tendency was toward tradition and stability.\u201d         \n\nKevan Gosper, an I.O.C. delegate from Australia, said Tokyo represented \u201ca pretty secure option and demonstrates a shift in world activity and economics and sport toward Asia,\u201d a reference to the 2008 Summer Games, held in Beijing, and the 2018 Winter Games, which will take place in Pyeongchang, South Korea.         \n\nPrince Albert, an I.O.C. delegate from Monaco, said Saturday\u2019s result also might have represented a strategy by the Olympic committee, which is Eurocentric, to vote for an Asian host with an eye toward returning the Summer Games to Europe in 2024.         \n\nRichard W. Pound, an I.O.C. member from Montreal, said he would not rule out the chances of the United States, which is expected to bid on the 2024 Games and has not hosted a Summer Olympics since the 1996 Games in Atlanta. The United States Olympic Committee and the I.O.C. recently settled a feud over sharing rights to television and sponsorship fees.         \n\n\u201cIf we are in kiss-and-make-up with the U.S., then why not?\u201d Pound said of the potential American chances.
