{"headline": "Court Permits Hailing of Taxis Across the City", "body": "\nThe state\u2019s highest court on Thursday unanimously upheld the Bloomberg administration\u2019s plan to radically expand street-hail taxi service beyond Manhattan, signaling a fundamental shift in New York City\u2019s entrenched taxi culture.         \n\nAs early as next month, thousands of the newly designated taxis \u2014 bearing fresh apple green paint, new roof lights and taximeters \u2014 will begin to descend on neighborhoods where yellow cabs rarely visit, addressing an inequity that has existed for decades.         \n\nThe 6-to-0 decision by the New York State Court of Appeals allows the city to issue up to 18,000 \u201chail licenses\u201d for livery cabs in northern Manhattan and the other boroughs.         \n\nThe ruling, which overturns a lower-court ruling that had stalled the action last year, also clears the way for the city to generate as much as $1 billion by auctioning off 2,000 medallions for wheelchair-accessible yellow taxis; the measure required that 20 percent of the livery vehicles be wheelchair-accessible.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re now set to do something that mayors have been trying to accomplish for decades, something that New Yorkers have deserved and never had,\u201d Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said at a news conference outside City Hall. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the right to hail a legal taxi in all five boroughs.\u201d         \n\nThe new plan will regulate an ad hoc and illegal practice that has existed for years. For many residents, it will mean an end to the era of the negotiated fare, where driver and passenger barter through a rolled-down window of a livery cab. David S. Yassky, the city\u2019s taxi commissioner, said the shift would yield \u201ca somewhat better deal\u201d for livery riders on average, citing city research into the underground market for livery cars.         \n\nThe cabs, which will also be required to accept credit cards, are prohibited from performing street hails in parts of Manhattan (south of East 96th Street and West 110th Street) and at the city\u2019s airports, where yellow taxis tend to cluster. Though the cabs can drop off passengers at these locations, the city said, their meters \u2014 equipped with a GPS device \u2014 will not operate if a driver tries to begin a trip within the so-called yellow zone.         \n\nMr. Yassky said livery drivers, whose business model has long relied on prearranged fares, could call 311 on Friday to begin the process of obtaining a street-hail license.         \n\nLast June, Justice Arthur F. Engoron of State Supreme Court in Manhattan  \n on the grounds that the city unlawfully sought the State Legislature\u2019s approval after the Bloomberg administration was stymied by the City Council.         \n\nJustice Engoron said then that \u201cthe argument that the city is in the state, and so is a state concern, simply proves too much,\u201d adding, \u201cThis court has trouble seeing how the provision of taxi service in New York City is a matter that can be wrenched from the hands of city government, where it has resided for some 75 years, and handed over to the state.\u201d         \n\nBut the Court of Appeals found that the law \u201caddresses a matter of substantial state concern.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThis is not a purely local issue,\u201d the decision read. \u201cMillions of people from within and without the state visit the city annually. Some of these visitors are disabled, and will undoubtedly benefit from the increase in accessible vehicles in the Manhattan central business district and in the outer boroughs.\u201d         \n\nMr. Yassky said in an interview on Thursday that he expected the yellow-taxi medallion sale to begin in October, more than a year after its uncertain status in the courts  \n.         \n\nSome in the livery industry have expressed concerns about the plan, suggesting that if cars were allowed to pick up passengers, fewer would be available to respond to dispatch calls in lower-traffic areas. One driver interviewed last year mused that the apple green paint was \u201clike a target\u201d for those, like him, who sought to pick up illegal street hails in Manhattan.         \n\nAnd many yellow-taxi operators, disinclined to share street hailing with livery cabs, have challenged the plan since its inception. The Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade, a plaintiff in one of the suits, called the decision \u201ca crushing blow to New Yorkers who loathe the brand of end-run politics that created this law.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThe court\u2019s finding that somehow hailing livery cabs in the Bronx is a \u2018matter of substantial state interest\u2019 \u2014 code words that were used to bypass the New York City Council \u2014 is alarming,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cThe ruling kicks open the door for systematic abuses for future executives in cities throughout the state, but particularly in New York City.\u201d         \n\nThe Bloomberg administration received more welcome news on Thursday when an appellate court lifted the injunction against its pilot program  \n in yellow cabs. The plan, which will allow drivers and riders to find one another without a traditional curbside street hail, has faced intense opposition from livery and black-car operators.         \n\nWith the two rulings on Thursday, the city seems to have broken a run of frustrating legal defeats related to the taxi industry. Besides the street-hail bill and the smartphone apps, the city\u2019s Taxi of Tomorrow plan for a near-uniform yellow-taxi fleet \u2014 which was to begin later this year \u2014 was invalidated last month. (The city\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission has suggested that it could rewrite the plan\u2019s rules to comply with the city code cited in the lawsuit.)         \n\nNoting a string of recent municipal feats, including the announcement of  \n and  \n, Mr. Bloomberg offered a hint of his weekend plans: a concert at the Barclays Center.         \n\n\u201cI for one am going to enjoy Paul McCartney on Saturday night,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe even have an extra beer.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/07/nyregion/plan-for-expanded-taxi-hailing-service-reinstated.html", "date": "2013-06-06", "description": "The state\u2019s highest court on Thursday cleared the way for New York City to issue up to 18,000 \u201chail licenses\u201d for livery cabs throughout the five boroughs."}
