They should be chunky and filled with plenty of vegetables and herbs like a pasta salad, yet still be thoroughly seasoned and well integrated. Ideally, the pasta-to-vegetable ratio should be about equal; light, bright and fresh is what I\u2019m after.         \n\nThis recipe is an example. The topping, a zucchini and tomato saut\u00e9 flavored with thyme and lemon, comes together quickly without heating up the kitchen too much. The pieces of squash sear and brown, the tomatoes burst, but neither ingredient loses its shape or turns to mush. It can stand up to al dente pasta, in this case farro pasta with a warm, toasty flavor and sturdy chew.         \n\nSmall, slim regular zucchini or ridged, pale green Romanesco zucchini work best here. They contain the least amount of water and will take on a golden sear more readily than fatter, seedier specimens. It pays to seek them out.         \n\nI have made versions of this dish with and without the ricotta salata. Not surprisingly, with the cheese is better; it adds creamy texture and a sharp, saline flavor. But if you\u2019d rather leave it out, toss a small spoonful of drained, brined capers or sliced olives into the pan to make up for the missing tang.         \n\nIf you have any extra corn lying around, slice the kernels off an ear and throw them into the pan along with the tomatoes. They\u2019ll add a nubby texture and mild sweetness.         \n\nThen serve this hot, warm or at room temperature, for as long as summer vegetable season lasts.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n1/2 teaspoon salt, more as needed         \n\n1/2 pound pasta, preferably farro pasta         \n\n2 small, slim zucchini (about 3/4 pound), trimmed and quartered lengthwise         \n\n2 tablespoons olive oil, more for drizzling         \n\n3 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled         \n\n6 sprigs fresh thyme, more for serving         \n\n1 pint cherry or grape tomatoes, halved         \n\n1 lemon, zested and cut into wedges         \n\n2 ounces ricotta salata, more for serving         \n\nFreshly ground black pepper         \n\n1. Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil and cook farro pasta according to package directions until al dente. Drain.         \n\n2. Meanwhile, cut zucchini into 1 1/2-inch lengths.         \n\n3. In a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat, add the olive oil and let heat for 30 seconds. Add zucchini in one layer and cook without touching or moving for 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and thyme, flip the zucchini and cook 3 more minutes while stirring occasionally.         \n\n4. Add tomatoes and 1/2 teaspoon salt to the skillet and cook for 6 to 7 minutes, or until tomatoes start to break down. Stir in the al dente pasta, lemon zest and crumbled cheese. Season with freshly cracked black pepper and serve garnished with more fresh thyme, ricotta salata and lemon wedges.
