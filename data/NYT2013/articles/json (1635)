{"headline": "3 in Europe Now Oppose Hezbollah", "body": "\nBERLIN \u2014 Three of Europe\u2019s most powerful countries \u2014 Britain, Germany and France \u2014 have thrown their weight behind a push for the European Union to designate the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah as a terrorist organization, a move that could have far-reaching consequences for the group\u2019s fund-raising activities on the Continent.         \n\nOn Wednesday, Germany signaled an about-face in its policy toward the group, with a statement saying Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle supported listing \u201cat least the military wing\u201d of the organization as a terrorist group. The announcement came just a day after Britain\u2019s Foreign Office said it would pursue doing the same, promising to \u201cwork closely with our European partners on this issue to reach a robust, collective E.U. position.\u201d         \n\nFrance had been undecided, but on Wednesday night Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said it would join Britain and Germany in seeking to have the \u201cmilitary wing\u201d of Hezbollah put on the European Union terrorist list, according to Agence France-Presse.         \n\nMr. Fabius was speaking in Amman, Jordan, after a meeting of the Friends of the Syrian People, a group designed to aid the rebellion against Mr. Assad.         \n\nIf approved, such a move could choke off sources of funds from Hezbollah\u2019s members and sympathizers throughout Europe, at a time when the group\u2019s image as a liberation movement has already suffered because Hezbollah fighters  \n on behalf of the government there.         \n\nThe United States and Israel have long urged their European allies to list the organization either in whole or in part as a terrorist group. But pressure has grown substantially since a bombing in July in Bulgaria killed five Israeli tourists and a Bulgarian bus driver. Bulgarian officials have said Hezbollah was behind the attack, which the group denies.         \n\nLaw enforcement can already pursue Hezbollah for the sorts of criminal activities associated with the group, including smuggling and counterfeiting, but even a partial blacklisting would bring added scrutiny. Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency said Hezbollah had 950 members and supporters in the country in 2011, the latest figure available.         \n\nStill, many experts question the strategy of simply taking aim at Hezbollah\u2019s military wing, arguing that it is impossible to separate the part of the organization that engages in politics and social services from the group\u2019s large armed militia. Moreover, if only the so-called military wing is blacklisted, the group might still be able raise money in Europe under the banner of politics.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if that makes any sense or you really can say there\u2019s a political wing and a terrorist wing,\u201d said Sylke Tempel, editor in chief of Internationale Politik, the journal published by the German Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cThey belong together like my left leg and my right leg.\u201d         \n\nBritain expects the European Union\u2019s secretive working group on terrorist designations \u2014 known as CP931 \u2014 to take up the matter on June 4 and European foreign ministers to consider the proposal and make a decision later in the month. In addition to the Bulgaria bombing, the British government cited the  \n in Cyprus for planning attacks against Israelis vacationing there as grounds for the change in policy.         \n\nWhile no one was killed in Cyprus, experts said during the trial there that a conviction in a court of law would very likely carry more weight in the European Union\u2019s bureaucratic decision-making process than accusations that the group was behind the deadly bombing in Bulgaria, no matter how well-founded the intelligence.         \n\nThe shift in stance by Germany, the most populous country in the European Union and its largest economy, signals a significant change in momentum. \u201cThe German position is based on an increasingly clearer picture of the facts and on the progress achieved by Cypriot authorities in analyzing terrorist activities,\u201d the statement said. \u201cMinister Westerwelle hopes that the necessary consultations within the E.U. can be concluded rapidly.\u201d         \n\nWhile German backing is critical, such a move would require unanimity among the 27 nations of the European Union, which could be difficult to achieve.         \n\nIn the past, France and some other countries, like Sweden, have opposed putting Hezbollah on the terrorist blacklist, fearing it could destabilize the Lebanese government. The Palestinian group Hamas is on the list, and a number of European countries now believe that listing Hamas was a mistake because of the important political role it plays in Gaza and in the Palestinian political world. European officials are banned from talking openly to Hamas officials, for example.         \n\nMr. Fabius explained the changed French position by emphasizing Syria, not Bulgaria. \u201cGiven the decisions taken by Hezbollah and the fact that it has fought very hard against the Syrian population, I confirm that France will propose to inscribe the military wing of Hezbollah on the list of terrorist organizations\u201d of the European Union, he said, according to Agence France-Presse.         \n\nHaving Paris support Britain and Germany will add considerable weight to their efforts.         \n\nIn recent days, Hezbollah fighters have joined the Syrian military in  \n of Qusayr, a strategic point long held by antigovernment forces.         \n\nNeither the British nor the Germans mentioned the situation in Syria, but it clearly has affected attitudes toward Hezbollah. \u201cObviously they\u2019re all sitting in Amman getting worried about Hezbollah,\u201d said Ms. Tempel, referring to the foreign ministers gathered in the capital of Jordan.         \n\nThere was no official reaction from Jerusalem, but one Israeli official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he had not been authorized to address the matter, called it \u201ca half-baked move.\u201d The official objected to the notion that only a \u201cmilitant wing,\u201d and not all of Hezbollah, would be deemed terrorist, saying it was akin to \u201ctrying to get in the pool and not get wet.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThis is a distinction that we believe is absolutely artificial,\u201d he said. \u201cHezbollah itself does not make any distinction between the political wing and the military wing, so why should anybody else? They\u2019re not all carrying around bombs, but the whole organization is centered around terror \u2014 it\u2019s one big military wing.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/23/world/middleeast/germany-and-britain-push-to-list-hezbollah-as-a-terror-group.html", "date": "2013-05-22", "description": "A day after Britain\u2019s announcement, Germany also said it supported listing the military wing of Hezbollah as a terrorist organization, a move that could hurt the Lebanese militant group\u2019s fund-raising."}
