{"headline": "Well Before Summer, Hamptons Luxury Real Estate Is Scorching", "body": "\nThe emerald hedgerows that are a natural euphemism for Hamptons exclusivity (out here, good hedges, not good fences, make for felicitous neighbors) are hanging tight.         \n\nMost of the double-decker dunes that define the East End\u2019s ocean coastline are hanging tight, too. That unfortunately can\u2019t be said for patches of  \n, Fire Island,  \n and  \n, where the extraordinary weather events of autumn 2012 transformed undulating beaches and waterfront homes to sodden pancakes. On the South Fork of Long Island, where the array of villages and hamlets includes  \n, Bridgehampton, Sag Harbor and Montauk, agents and town officials say only one home, owned by the Lauder family and precariously perched at water\u2019s edge in Wainscott, drowned in the maelstrom created by  \n. But erosion is a perennial enemy, and efforts to rebuff it, continual.         \n\nOtherwise, it\u2019s back to business bolstering the bulkheads and merchandising the seductive strata of housing stock (from darling shingled cottages to resorts-masquerading-as-mansions), with brokers forecasting yet another pricey summer season. \u201cNobody really suffers from Hamptons sticker shock anymore,\u201d said Judi Desiderio, the founder of Town and Country Real Estate.         \n\nHarald Grant, a senior vice president of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, has already rented out an oceanfront house in Southampton for $550,000 for the month of August alone and has a stack of 14 contracts and purchase memos on his desk representing pending sales of $4.5 million to $25 million. Not to worry: the most expensive oceanfront property in  \n, on  \n\u2019s Lily Pond Lane and co-listed by Tim Davis of the Corcoran Group and Diane Saatchi of Saunders & Associates, is still available for $40 million.         \n\nFor high-rolling renters, Mr. Grant has a trio of oceanfront rentals in Southampton that can be had for the summer for $400,000, $600,000 or $800,000. Why pay $25 million to buy, and more to maintain, a summer getaway when you can rent and run? Or, for a million or so, you can rent year round.         \n\n\u201cBut in general what\u2019s different this season,\u201d Mr. Grant said, \u201cis that in the mind of most buyers, less is more, and nobody wants to be the king of the hill and flaunt their wealth the way people were doing before the recession.         \n\n\u201cFolks who spent $20,000 for a month\u2019s rental,\u201d he continued, \u201cmay be looking to spend $15,000. Folks who could be driving a Rolls-Royce are settling for a Mercedes. People aren\u2019t saying, \u2018I have to have it; I\u2019ll pay anything,\u2019 and writing checks on the spot. An owner who says, \u2018I want $32 million for my oceanfront house\u2019 probably isn\u2019t going to get it. He\u2019ll get somewhere in the mid-20s.\u201d         \n\nBut only if the house has a pool, a tennis court and central air-conditioning; just being oceanfront isn\u2019t enough anymore.         \n\nStill, abundant deals are to be had for perceptive buyers who don\u2019t require fur vaults, wine caves or home theaters.         \n\n\u201cI just sold a wonderful house for $2.9 million in Southampton Village,\u201d Mr. Grant said. \u201cFive bedrooms, five bathrooms and a pool on half an acre. My clients would have liked a tennis court, but instead of spending $5 million, they scaled back a bit and they\u2019re happy and comfortable with that decision.\u201d         \n\nMr. Davis, of Corcoran, found a $1.75 million mini-estate on 1.7 acres near Little Peconic Bay in Southampton for Barry LePatner, a  \n lawyer, and his wife, Marla Tomazin, an image consultant, after they told him they were looking for a private spot with year-round proximity to the city and great curb appeal. \u201cWe wanted to find a house that made us happy and excited to see it every time we pulled into the driveway,\u201d Mr. LePatner said.         \n\nIt wasn\u2019t an easy search, until Mr. Davis remembered a house he had listed a few years back at what he thought was an exorbitant price. It hadn\u2019t sold, and he no longer had the listing. But when he approached the owners, who were eager to retire to  \n, they were open to an offer.         \n\n\u201cWe loved the house the minute we saw it,\u201d Mr. LePatner said. \u201cIt had great trees, a great big garden, a pool, and I never imagined I\u2019d be able to buy a second home with a tennis court.\u201d (He plays.)         \n\n\u201cThe icing on the cake,\u201d he continued, \u201cwas that we got a 15-year fixed mortgage at 2.8 percent, and on Jan. 9 we closed. The timing was just right \u2014 maybe if you bought out here in 2006 you made a big mistake and paid too much, but Tim assured us there was no way we\u2019d lose out buying at this price in a rising market.\u201d         \n\nIn a departure from years past, Ms. Desiderio said, 6 of the 10 most expensive Hamptons homes to sell in 2012 were inland. There, the pastoral and pristine prevailed. But for a few extra leaves in the swimming pool, the landlocked housing stock survived the meteorological dramas of last fall mostly unscathed.         \n\nAnd prices are in fine fettle, same as those trademark hedges. Quarterly reports indicate that they are not only intact, but even embarking on a growth spurt. Properties under $1.4 million in turnkey condition are, said Caroline Sarraf of Brown Harris Stevens, \u201cflying off the shelves, especially if they\u2019re within walking distance of the villages. Younger buyers all want something that\u2019s \u2018done\u2019 and doesn\u2019t need any work.
