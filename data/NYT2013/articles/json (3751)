{"headline": "Where Jeter and Yanks Go From Here", "body": "\nBALTIMORE \u2014 The beginning was so glorious, and so unusual. Eighteen years ago, the Yankees promoted four players from the minor leagues who would go on to play, collectively, at least 70 seasons for the team, mostly as superstars. There is no reason to expect such a bounty again.         \n\nRemember this: everything that was young and fresh and crackling with possibility in 1995 came true. Those rookies \u2014  \n, Mariano Rivera, Andy Pettitte and Jorge Posada \u2014 would go on to win five World Series together. Babe Ruth won only four in pinstripes. Jeter and Rivera are locks for the Hall of Fame, and Pettitte and Posada will get votes.         \n\nThose players helped build a network and a stadium and a star-driven business model that has made the Yankees richer than George Steinbrenner ever could have dreamed. But the sad fact of their story is that there is no easy ending. The point was driven home again Wednesday with the sobering news that Jeter will miss the rest of the season, surrendering at last to the pain in the ankle he broke last October.         \n\n\u201cA lot of \u2018end\u2019 talk here, man \u2014 do you guys want this to be the end for me?\u201d Jeter said at a news conference at Camden Yards, polite but exasperated at questions about his career mortality. \u201cHave I thought about it? No. I don\u2019t think you think about the end of anything. Our job is to be ready to play; it\u2019s always been that way.         \n\n\u201cI tried to come back this year as quickly as possible, every time I came back. Looking back, maybe that wasn\u2019t the best thing to do. My job now is to get ready for next year.\u201d         \n\nThe Yankees did not have to place Jeter on the disabled list; with expanded rosters, there is no reason. But they made the move, General Manager  \n said, to save them from the temptation of putting Jeter in a game.         \n\nThe stilted nature of his season \u2014 four separate stints on the disabled list \u2014 was more than tedious. It was dangerous. Jeter, 39, has an $8 million player option for 2014, and he has never hinted at retirement. Had he continued to play with weakness in the muscles, ligaments and tendons around his left ankle, he would have risked a truly inglorious end.         \n\n\u201cThe worst-case scenario is a break,\u201d Cashman said. \u201cWe cannot be in that position to have a break, because then you could be talking about a career-ending situation if he rebroke that thing. And we\u2019re not going to put him in that position.\u201d         \n\nCashman cut loose Posada in 2011, and Bernie Williams in 2006, when he saw no more use for them as  \n. He has put off-season plans on hold while waiting for Pettitte to decide on his future. Rivera returned for this farewell season only after sustaining a devastating knee injury while chasing fly balls in batting practice in 2012.         \n\nJeter, it seemed, had overcome the awkwardness. Cashman publicly challenged him to find a better offer in free agency after the 2010 season, tough talk that rankled Jeter. When Jeter led the majors in hits last season, he restored the sheen to his game.         \n\nThen the ankle snapped in the American League Championship Series. Jeter had little range to lose, and now he would be trying to return to a demanding position without his usual off-season preparation. It was a disaster, and now he is trying again.         \n\nThe Yankees must know it is foolish, and probably unfair to Jeter, to expect him to be a regular shortstop in 2014. How many more warning signs do they need? He struggles with range, even in peak health. He turns 40 next June. The ankle betrayed him repeatedly this season.         \n\n\u201cI will never doubt Derek because of who he is,\u201d Manager  \n said. \u201cAnd if he believes that he can get back, I believe him. That\u2019s the bottom line. So you proceed forward, and we\u2019ll see where we\u2019re at, see how the winter goes.\u201d         \n\nThe Yankees do not need to declare Jeter a full-time designated hitter at the moment, but any other conclusion is illogical. They won their last title in 2009 partly by refusing to let Hideki Matsui play at all in the field because of his creaky knees. Matsui, a national hero in Japan, had every bit as much pride as Jeter. He went along with the plan and won the Most Valuable Player award in the World Series as a pinch-hitter and D.H.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not thinking about getting hurt again,\u201d Jeter said. \u201cIt sounds kind of funny saying it now, considering how many times I\u2019ve been hurt, but I truly believe with a full off-season of working out and getting my strength back that I\u2019ll get back to doing what I\u2019ve always done.\u201d         \n\nIt is never wise to bet against a player with Jeter\u2019s track record and will. But the better bet might be that the Yankees sign a free agent \u2014 Stephen Drew or Jhonny Peralta if they want offense; Clint Barmes or the new Yankee Brendan Ryan if they want defense.         \n\nEssentially, Jeter lost a full season trying to do something his body would not let him do. He should not gamble 2014 on the hope of playing shortstop again, and the Yankees should not let him.         \n\nGeorge Brett, another single-franchise superstar, did not play in the field his final season. Neither did Jeter\u2019s childhood hero, Dave Winfield. Paul Molitor, who had 3,319 career hits to Jeter\u2019s 3,316, played only D.H. and first base after turning 35. All of them rode off to Cooperstown. There is no shame in Jeter\u2019s pursuing the same path.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt in my mind I\u2019ll be back to where I was,\u201d Jeter said Wednesday, displaying the same competitive streak that helped make him great, and the same one that may hold him back from the graceful ending he deserves.
