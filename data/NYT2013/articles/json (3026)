{"headline": "A Health Provider Strives to Keep Hospital Beds Empty", "body": "\nCHICAGO \u2014 On a stormy evening this spring, nurses at Dr. Gary Stuck\u2019s family practice were on the phone with patients with heart ailments, asking them not to shovel snow. The idea was to keep them out of the hospital, and that effort \u2014 combined with dozens more like it \u2014 is starting to make a difference: across the city, doctors are providing less, but not worse, health care.         \n\nFor most health care providers, that would be cause for alarm. But not for  \n, based in Oak Brook, Ill., a pioneer in an approach known as \u201caccountable care\u201d that offers financial incentives for doctors and hospitals to cut costs rather than funnel patients through an ever-greater volume of costly medical services. Under the agreement, hospital admissions are down 6 percent. Days spent in the hospital are down nearly 9 percent. The average length of a stay has declined, and many other measures show doctors providing less care, too.         \n\nThis approach is one small part of a growing effort by providers to hold down costs without restricting needed care. Nationwide, health care spending has grown over the last three years at the slowest rate since the federal government started keeping data more than 50 years ago. While the bulk of that is related to the poor economy, changes among insurers and health care providers have contributed as well. If the trend continues, even at a reduced pace, it could help alleviate Washington\u2019s long-term deficit problems and ease the strain on family budgets.         \n\n\u201cThe part that\u2019s not driven by the economy, that\u2019s the part we can theoretically control,\u201d said Drew Altman, president of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. \u201cIf we can shave even a small percentage off of it, it has a huge impact on public programs, a huge impact on premiums, a huge impact on employers.\u201d         \n\nBut even as more health systems seek to replicate Advocate\u2019s early success, its experience shows just how hard it may be to expand the approach and keep medical costs from resuming their relentless rise.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine that you could start from scratch and do this and be successful in three years,\u201d said Dr. Lee Sacks, Advocate\u2019s chief medical officer, noting that other systems may find it far harder to flip the traditional fee-for-services system on its head. \u201cWe had a running head-start going back to 1995.\u201d         \n\nNonetheless, the Affordable Care Act, President Obama\u2019s  \n, has helped encourage a shift to Advocate\u2019s payment model. Such agreements were merely a theory four years ago. But an estimated 428 accountable-care organizations now cover four million  \n enrollees and millions more people with private insurance.         \n\nUnder Advocate\u2019s deal with Blue Cross Blue Shield, certain patients are assigned to the accountable care framework \u2014 about 380,000 \u2014 and their health costs are projected. If Advocate achieves savings below that amount while meeting explicit quality targets, it splits the money with the insurer. If not, its revenue is at risk.         \n\nIn some ways, accountable care resembles earlier efforts to control medical spending, including the health maintenance organizations that proliferated in the 1980s but fell out of favor, in part because they severely limited patients\u2019 choices. But accountable care differs by giving doctors and hospitals a direct financial stake in saving money and a reason to invest in various programs of preventive care rather than relying exclusively on the fees they would normally earn from providing services.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an enormous amount at stake in getting these reforms to work,\u201d said Alan Krueger, the chairman of President Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers.         \n\nTo help control costs, Advocate has hired scores of workers to coordinate care and keep an eye on the highest-cost patients, like those who are obese or have diabetes. It started providing doctors\u2019 offices with report cards on their performance. Dozens of quality-control measures cover items as varied as blood pressure, rehospitalizations for asthma attacks or the use of expensive imaging machines.         \n\nOn a blustery spring morning, those changes were visible in Advocate care centers across the metropolitan area. Sumera Khan, a clinical pharmacy specialist, popped into the hospital room of Noraine Scarpelli, an elderly woman with congestive heart failure, to check her prescription drug levels, an additional level of scrutiny that can help prevent complications. In another building, Dr. Karen O\u2019Mara flicked between eight computer screens, peering at intensive care patients miles away, ready to alert a doctor if they looked in distress.
