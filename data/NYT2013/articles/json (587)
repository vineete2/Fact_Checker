{"headline": "Where Streets Flood With the Tide, a Debate Over City Aid", "body": "\nAs the sun began to set one recent Sunday, saltwater poured off Jamaica Bay onto West 12th Road, one of the lowest-lying areas in New York City.         \n\nResidents bolted out of their front doors to move their cars, which are often damaged by tidal flooding that occurs here about twice a month. Some older residents were all but imprisoned in their homes until as much as three feet of water receded. Children splashed around, oblivious to the looming threat.         \n\n\u201cWe do not care about budgets; we are taxpaying people,\u201d said John Heaphy, 69, a lifelong resident of the area, Broad Channel, Queens, which is built on a marsh that juts into the bay. \u201cFrom the lowest politician to the governor\u2019s office, we\u2019ve been begging, please help us.\u201d         \n\nNow, the city is doing just that, budgeting $22 million to try to save the neighborhood by installing bulkheads and by raising streets and sidewalks by three feet.         \n\nThe Broad Channel project offers a preview of the infrastructure outlays that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is envisioning as part of a  \n to protect the city\u2019s 520 miles of coast over the next decade from rising sea levels.         \n\nBut the project also raises fundamental questions about whether, in an era of extreme weather, the government should come to the aid of neighborhoods that are trying to fend off inevitably rising waters.         \n\nBroad Channel\u2019s vulnerability was exposed in October during Hurricane Sandy, which toppled homes into the bay, some of which still lie in ruins along the beach. Yet the situation here is far worse than in some other neighborhoods damaged in the hurricane because Broad Channel suffers flooding from the tides and heavy rain, not just from storm surges.         \n\nEric A. Goldstein,  \n, an environmental advocacy group, said he was sympathetic to Broad Channel and understood why residents have been lobbying hard for aid.         \n\n\u201cThe problem is, they have picked a spectacularly beautiful but increasingly impractical and dangerous place to live,\u201d Mr. Goldstein said.         \n\n\u201cIf sea levels rise and storm-level projections are accurate, this community may be surviving on borrowed time,\u201d he said. He added that the city faced hard questions, one being: \u201cHow much sense does it make to keep reinvesting taxpayer dollars in a community that is directly in harm\u2019s way?\u201d         \n\nMr. Goldstein said the city should also consider allocating money to those who wanted to relocate.         \n\nOther experts pointed out that these projects were not only costly  \n, and based on techniques that might not always work well over time. They must overcome a phalanx of obstacles before being approved, from reviews by government agencies to a lack of consensus among residents.         \n\nThe one in Broad Channel has already been held up because officials have not yet been able to obtain consent from some residents, which is required because they technically own the sidewalks.         \n\nThe Bloomberg administration also has expressed concern about the difficulties of protecting this part of the Queens coast.         \n\nWhen Mayor Bloomberg  \n, he vowed that the city would not abandon the waterfront. But the plan notes that major flood protection along Jamaica Bay would be \u201cextremely expensive, and disruptive, and in some cases nearly impossible.\u201d         \n\nAs a result, the city wants to ask the United States Army Corps of Engineers to develop a storm-surge barrier across the Rockaway Inlet to protect neighborhoods from Sheepshead Bay to Howard Beach, as well as Broad Channel.         \n\nAs far as the street-raising, Caswell F. Holloway IV, the deputy mayor for operations, acknowledged that such projects were also challenging.         \n\n\u201cIt is literally a block-by-block issue, especially older neighborhoods, where the neighborhood grew up much faster than the infrastructure to support it,\u201d Mr. Holloway said. \u201cYou\u2019re basically going back, in some cases over the course of many years, to do modern drainage. It\u2019s highly disruptive, it\u2019s expensive, because it\u2019s being laid out after the fact.\u201d         \n\nAsked whether the Broad Channel project would only forestall the inevitable, he said, \u201cWe focused on a solution that was affordable and would alleviate the flooding situation for a while.\u201d         \n\nResidents describe Broad Channel as an oasis with glorious water views. About 3,000 people live here, including many police officers and firefighters.
