{"headline": "Naval Academy Is Shaken by Student\u2019s Report of Rape by Athletes", "body": "\nANNAPOLIS, Md. \u2014 As midshipmen were graduating from the Naval Academy here last week, Navy investigators were conducting an investigation into reports that several football players had serially raped a female midshipman at an off-campus party last year.         \n\nThree Navy football players are under investigation in the case, according to Naval Academy officials. No charges have been brought, but the academy has delayed the graduation of one of the three midshipmen and his commissioning in the Navy, according to academy officials and others briefed on the inquiry. The academy\u2019s superintendent, Vice Adm. Michael H. Miller, is expected to receive a final report from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service in the next week or two and then decide whether to proceed with charges, according to academy officials.         \n\nThe investigation, stemming from an April 2012 party, has sputtered off and on for more than a year, hampered in part by the woman\u2019s initial refusal to cooperate, the officials said. She was ashamed and then later felt intimidated, according to her Washington lawyer, Susan Burke. In a series of interviews, the female midshipman said that she was upset that she had faced disciplinary action for under-age drinking at the party while the football players were permitted to play last season.         \n\nAcademy officials acknowledged the inquiry but declined to comment further. \u201cNaval Academy leadership is monitoring the progress of this investigation and evaluating the appropriate options for adjudication,\u201d a spokesman said in a statement. \u201cIt is completely inappropriate to make any other public comment on this investigation or any ongoing investigation, as we risk compromising the military justice process.\u201d         \n\nAcademy officials said that the players were allowed to play for the team last fall because no charges had been brought in the case and they were accorded the presumption of innocence as a result. Officials described the case as delicate and complex, and one in which the investigation has been hampered by the limits of the available evidence.         \n\nThe inquiry comes amid a growing national controversy over sexual assaults in the military \u2014 and over whether he Pentagon has reacted aggressively enough to curb them. The controversy has now reached into the cloistered world of the elite service academies.         \n\nIn January, a Naval Academy instructor was charged with raping a female midshipman; the court-martial began this week. The Naval Academy has said that it had 51 total reports of unwanted sexual contact during the academic years from 2011 through 2013.         \n\nBut in recent interviews, current and former female midshipmen said they believe many more episodes go unreported. They said that women, who first arrived in Annapolis in 1976 and now make up 22 percent of the student population, are often worried about the consequences.         \n\nCandace Tisdale, a midshipman and a friend of the woman at the center of the current investigation, said women at the academy learn to adapt to harassment and a sometimes-hostile climate. \u201cThe desire to be accepted by the group, and the high stress during plebe summer and plebe year, make you accept it,\u201d she said. The academy culture teaches midshipmen to meet high moral standards but also drills into students not to \u201cthrow shipmates under the bus,\u201d she said.         \n\nAnnie Kendzior, a former midshipman who has filed a lawsuit over two alleged assaults by athletes in 2008 that she did not report to the academy until 2011, said she initially declined to pursue the cases because she \u201cdidn\u2019t want to be labeled as this person who got varsity athletes kicked out.\u201d         \n\nIn a series of interviews, the female midshipman involved in the 2012 episode now under investigation offered an account of that April night and its aftermath. Naval Academy officials confirmed many of the basic facts that she provided in her account.         \n\nNow 21, she asked to remain anonymous, concerned about her career and reputation. She said that after that night, she was taunted and harassed by other midshipmen and suffered from depression for months.         \n\nIn a public statement Friday, Ms. Burke, her lawyer, said the woman \u201cwas ostracized and retaliated against by the football players and the Naval Academy community.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/01/us/naval-academy-shaken-by-report-of-rape-and-inquiry.html", "date": "2013-05-31", "description": "An investigation of three midshipmen has gone on for more than a year amid growing controversy over military sexual assaults."}
