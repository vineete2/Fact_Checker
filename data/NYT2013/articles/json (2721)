She would go up and down our street for at least an hour every day. She was out there in all kinds of weather, always wearing headphones and a backpack, often chewing gum.         \n\nShe didn\u2019t live in our neighborhood; we figured she picked our street for its degree of incline. Sometimes we saw her riding around other parts of northwest D.C. \u2014 we learned to spot her ponytail and particular grit from far away. I was in high school when we first started seeing her. She looked to be in her 40s and was dangerously thin, so I assumed, perhaps incorrectly, that her punishing schedule was connected to an eating disorder. (\u201cAnorexic biker\u201d was an unkind moniker, but I\u2019d had my own brushes with disordered eating.)         \n\nShe became a fixture in our lives, though we never talked to her. My sisters and I went off to college, but when we came home for the holidays, the biker was still there. We had to admire her discipline. While we stuffed ourselves on Thanksgiving turkey, she was burning calories. While we retreated into air-conditioning on scorching summer days, she was sweating hard. Her obsessive presence became routine.         \n\nAnd so it shouldn\u2019t have surprised me that she was there eight years ago on the day that my mother\u2019s body was carried out of our house. She had died of cancer at just 60 years old. We\u2019d been preparing for her death for weeks. When her doctor said all treatment options had been exhausted, in March of that year, I took an unpaid leave of absence from my job in New York and came home.         \n\nThe hospice nurses made daily visits to check her pain levels and adjust her dosages of morphine. My father, sisters and I took turns staying up with my mother at night. She didn\u2019t want to lie in bed, was afraid to sleep \u2014 presumably because she knew she might not wake up \u2014 and so she insisted that we push her around the second floor of our house in her wheelchair. (By then she was too weak to walk.) On the nights that I was on duty, I begged her to rest. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to sleep,\u201d I told her. \u201cI\u2019ll read to you.\u201d I offered to read Alice Munro. She could barely speak, but she shook her head no and made a small circle with her finger in the air. She wanted to keep going. I pushed the wheelchair around and around the house while everyone slept.         \n\nIt was late April when she finally let go. The flowers were in full bloom, and I remember thinking that no one should die on such a beautiful day. My sisters and I were lying in bed, holding her, when she died. My father called the hospice nurse, who phoned the funeral home. They came to take her away.         \n\nWe followed our mother\u2019s body down the stairs and into the hall \u2014 we would have given anything to hold onto her for just one more hour \u2014 and when they wheeled the gurney out into our front yard, I went with them and suddenly sank to my knees with a primal wail. I couldn\u2019t help myself: I was on the grass, sobbing, ready to pull out my hair with grief. The histrionics of Greek tragedy suddenly made sense to me. And then I looked up, and there she was, our very own Sisyphus. The witness to our loss. The audience for my pain. Our eyes met briefly, the biker\u2019s and mine. And then she kept riding while the men from the funeral home loaded my mother\u2019s body into a van.         \n\nThe next day, I found a card under the front door. \u201cTo the entire Holt family,\u201d the envelope said. It was a letter of condolence from the biker. She was touched, she said, to see our family unite to take care of our mother for the past couple of years. She was sincerely sorry for our loss.         \n\nHad she always known our names? Or had we once been stock characters to her? Had she been watching us all those years while we were watching her? I wondered what other moments of human drama she\u2019d glimpsed from the perch of her bicycle seat. What family squabbles had spilled out on the lawn.         \n\nIt was a lovely card. When she came riding up our street that afternoon, I ran outside to meet her. \u201cThank you,\u201d I said, finally calling her by her name.
