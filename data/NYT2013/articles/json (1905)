{"headline": "Amid All the Strikeouts, One Big Swing", "body": "\nDETROIT \u2014 Major league hitters struck out 36,710 times during the regular season. That was a record, breaking the one set just last year.         \n\nHitters swing for the fences, without widespread use of drugs to help their long drives take flight. Pitchers, bred to throw harder for shorter bursts of time, study increasingly detailed scouting reports on hitters\u2019 weaknesses. The shame of striking out, for most hitters, is a relic of past generations.         \n\nWhich brings us to the 2013 American League Championship Series, brought to you by the letter K. The  \n have struck out 43 times in 90 at-bats in three games, yet they hold a two-games-to-one lead over the  \n.         \n\nThe Tigers struck out 12 times in Game 3 on Tuesday. The Red Sox struck out 11. Facing a 96-mile-an-hour fastball from Justin Verlander in the seventh inning, Mike Napoli took a big swing with a full count. He could have easily struck out. Instead he hit a homer for the only run of the game.         \n\nWelcome to the new age.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s probably a little more tendency to drive a ball, even with two strikes, rather than a pronounced two-strike approach, just to protect,\u201d Red Sox Manager John Farrell said. \u201cBut, thankfully, Nap didn\u2019t try to protect today.\u201d         \n\nNapoli had struck out six times in six at-bats before connecting for the game-winner. His series, and his season, is the modern player in microcosm. With power hitters hard to find in the era of drug testing, teams tend to tolerate strikeouts if the payoff for swinging hard is the occasional home run.         \n\nNapoli whiffed 187 times this season, a career high, but he also drove in 92 runs \u2014 another career high \u2014 and ripped 23 homers. The trade-off was worth it for the Red Sox, who expect him to wear down pitchers at worst and punish mistakes at best.         \n\n\u201cEvery at-bat, I try to see a lot of pitches,\u201d Napoli said. \u201cI feel like the more pitches I see, the better for me. The more I get involved into that at-bat, the more I can see stuff.\u201d         \n\nWhenever the Red Sox start talking like this, explaining the reasons they saw more pitches than any other offense in the majors, they immediately hedge and insist they are aggressive at hunting strikes. But there is no need to apologize.         \n\nAs futile as they have seemed against Anibal Sanchez, Max Scherzer and Justin Verlander, the Red Sox\u2019 approach is working. In 21 innings against the Tigers\u2019 starters, Boston has 6 hits, 2 runs and 35 strikeouts. Yet what has it cost them?         \n\nIn Game 1, they drew six walks against Sanchez and drove him from the game after six innings. That time, the Tigers\u2019 shaky bullpen held a 1-0 lead. The next night, Scherzer came out after seven and the Red Sox devoured the Tigers\u2019 relievers. On Tuesday, because John Lackey and the bullpen pitched so well, the Red Sox needed only one homer to win.         \n\n\u201cTonight we didn\u2019t take many good swings,\u201d said Jake Peavy, who starts Game 4 for the Red Sox on Wednesday, \u201cbut we took the one good swing.\u201d         \n\nThe Red Sox set a franchise record for strikeouts this season, with 1,308. That is 111 more than their old record, set last season, when they lost 93 games and finished last. They gladly swapped all those empty at-bats for the overwhelming increase in runs: 119 more this season.         \n\nThe Tigers\u2019 pitchers, especially the ones the Red Sox have faced so far, are going to get their strikeouts. They almost have to; their ability to keep so many balls from going into play allows the Tigers to survive with a weaker defense than most teams.         \n\nThis year, Verlander, Scherzer and Sanchez became the first set of three teammates in 44 years to each record 200 strikeouts in a season. The staff as a whole set a single-season major league record for strikeouts. Verlander, in particular, is pitching as well as he ever has.         \n\n\u201cWe knew what we were going to get,\u201d Boston catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone thought we were going to walk all over this game and win. We were going to have to battle and grind. That\u2019s what made Lackey\u2019s start even better. We knew we weren\u2019t going to get a lot of runs.\u201d         \n\nThe Boston staff has been nearly flawless, holding Detroit to one run in 211/3 innings against all pitchers besides Clay Buchholz, who was hit hard in Game 2. Detroit\u2019s hitters ranked 28th in strikeouts this season and they have generally made decent contact this series. In 102 at-bats, the Tigers have struck out just 25 times.         \n\nBut in the big spots on Tuesday, they looked helpless. With runners at the corners and one out in the eighth, Farrell reached for a power arm against Miguel Cabrera, who has been diminished by an abdominal injury this postseason. Junichi Tazawa struck him out with a fastball away.         \n\n\u201cIt was a pivotal moment,\u201d Farrell said. \u201cYou\u2019re getting the best guy in baseball at the plate, trying to preserve a one-run lead. That was a swing moment, for sure.\u201d         \n\nKoji Uehara ended the eighth by striking out Prince Fielder with a splitter. He ended the game the same way against Alex Avila. As they so often are these days, the swing moments were misses.
