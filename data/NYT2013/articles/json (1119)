{"headline": "Bumpy Start for Teacher Evaluation Program in New York Schools", "body": "\nOver the 24 years Lily Din Woo has been the principal of  \n in Lower Manhattan, her typical day changed very little: sick or misbehaving students, budgets, curriculum woes and meetings with parents, many of whom do not speak English.         \n\nThis year, however, she and the assistant principal are spending parts of each day darting in and out of classrooms, clipboards and iPads in hand, as they go over checklists for good teaching. Is the lesson clear? Is the classroom organized?         \n\nAll told, they will spend over two of the 40 weeks of the school year on such visits. The hours spent sitting with teachers to discuss each encounter and entering their marks into the school system\u2019s temperamental teacher-grading database easily stretch to more than a month.         \n\n\u201cAt some point, something is just going to give,\u201d Ms. Woo, 62, said. \u201cThe observations are important, but so is counseling a troubled child or a family struggling to help their children at home.\u201d         \n\nAll the added work was a result of a new  \n that began in New York City this fall. A prime accomplishment of the education reform movement, the system \u2014 or versions of it \u2014 has been adopted in most states. It has been widely embraced, in theory, as an overdue improvement in the way teachers are measured.         \n\nBut it is also reordering the daily and weekly rhythms of the school experience in fundamental ways.         \n\nStudents must take more tests, in the name of rating their teachers, which has caused a  \n by parents and has already led to a  \n, particularly in the early grades.         \n\nCity education officials are sending out waves of \u201ctalent coaches\u201d to help principals with the assessments. They are also looking for money to hire retired supervisors to pitch in at schools where the workload is heavy. And last week, to address principals\u2019 concerns, officials said they would make the observation requirements more flexible.         \n\nThis is all coinciding with more rigorous academic standards, known as the Common Core, which require whole new curriculums in some cases.         \n\nOne morning last month at  \n in Park Slope, Brooklyn, nine adults were at work in a first-grade classroom of 30 general and special education students: the teacher being observed, a second teacher and three paraprofessionals assigned to the classroom, the principal, the assistant principal, a talent coach and a school system official serving as an adviser.         \n\nThe teacher being scrutinized, Nina Phillips, was using a book on castles to show students how to find evidence to test their beliefs. For instance, the students\u2019 original notion that \u201ceveryone had a castle a long time ago\u201d was proved untrue because the book showed it was mainly kings and queens and lords and ladies who lived in them.         \n\nLater, the principal, Linda Mazza, and the other observers discussed the visit for about an hour, praising the bulk of Ms. Phillips\u2019s performance, particularly in monitoring students\u2019 behavior, giving feedback and seamlessly transitioning between student discussions \u2014 known as turn-and-talks \u2014 and lecturing.         \n\nBut the talent coach, Marcella Barros, raised a question about Ms. Phillips\u2019s use of yes-or-no questions like \u201cDoes this remind you of anything that we came up with on our list of ideas?\u201d rather than a more open-ended prompt.         \n\n\u201cI guess I was wondering if there was a way to engage them more in questions,\u201d Ms. Barros said.         \n\nWhile Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio might be able to change some elements of the evaluation process, much of it is enshrined in state law. The new system rates teachers as highly effective, effective, developing or ineffective based on a mix of classroom observations, students\u2019 growth on state exams and locally developed tests or measures. Teachers rated ineffective two years in a row could be subject to firing.         \n\nFor observations, teachers can choose either six 15-minute sessions or three 15-minute visits and one for about an hour.         \n\nFor a principal like Ms. Woo, that adds up to nearly 90 hours for her and her assistant just to do the observations. They also must fill out paperwork and log their reports into a new computer program. Several principals described the program as inconvenient instead of helpful, and said it did not have a spell-check function and sometimes logged them off before they could save their work. Education officials said the problems were being fixed.
