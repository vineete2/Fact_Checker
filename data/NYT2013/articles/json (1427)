{"headline": "When Fury Can Be a Force for Good Ends", "body": "\n \n can grow easily irritated, and he minces fewer words the closer he gets to the end of his near-infinite mayoralty.         \n\nLast week, when two of Brooklyn\u2019s state senators put the kibosh on the mayor\u2019s request for cameras intended to nab drivers who speed near city schools, Hizzoner did not bother with conversational niceties.         \n\nHe offered to hand out the telephone numbers of the senators,  \n         \n\n\u201cMaybe you want to give those phone numbers to the parents of the child when a child is killed,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cIt would be useful so that the parents can know exactly who\u2019s to blame.\u201d         \n\nYou might wince at the mayor\u2019s ire except that it\u2019s hard not to applaud. I have written critically of the Police Department\u2019s investigation of pedestrian deaths, and under great pressure from the City Council and advocates, that department has budged of late.         \n\nIt\u2019s difficult, however, to quibble with the mayor\u2019s commitment, from pedestrian plazas to bike lanes, to make this a safer city for walkers and bikers. And the installation of red light and speed cameras has sharply cut pedestrian fatalities, from suburban London to Baton Rouge, La.         \n\nSpeeding was a factor in about 30 percent of New York City\u2019s traffic fatalities, which hit a four-year high last year. \u201cWhile we wait,\u201d notes the transportation commissioner, Janette Sadik-Khan, \u201cNew Yorkers are dying on our streets.\u201d         \n\nSuch arguments seem intellectually persuasive, although my thoughts tiptoe more in the direction of you-must-be-kidding. I wonder if the two state senators have tried walking across the six-lane Ocean Parkway as drivers rev their engines? The walk sign flashes, there are 16 seconds left on green, and your thought is that the penalty for miscalculation is death.         \n\nMaria Manzone paused on a recent sunny afternoon and peered warily at the traffic river that is Ocean Parkway. She\u2019s a silver-haired Brooklyn walker of many decades. \u201cPersonally? I\u2019m not a driver, O.K?\u201d she said. \u201cThe mayor and those cameras of his \u2014 it\u2019s fine with me, O.K.?\u201d         \n\nO.K.         \n\nTransportation advocates have put out  \n that  \n across the city. On the far eastern end of Senator Golden\u2019s district, on the fast-running Avenue U, there are two dots, which represent an 82-year-old man and an 88-year-old woman mowed down two years apart near that corner.         \n\nIn the last three years, nearly 60 pedestrians have died in traffic accidents in the districts of these two senators.         \n\nIn an interview, Senator Golden, a Republican, said that cameras were intrusive, and he\u2019d prefer to substitute speed bumps, flashing yellow lights and stop signs. All of that sounds good. But a recent city study found 29 schools where more than 90 percent of nearby drivers were speeding; a yellow light seems unlikely to persuade an over-caffeinated sport utility vehicle driver to brake on Linden Boulevard.         \n\nThe senator, perhaps more to the point, is a political friend of the Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Association, which would prefer that police officers sit at intersections rather than have the city rely on speed cameras. (This is law enforcement as a jobs program.)         \n\nSenator Felder, a Democrat who caucuses with Republicans, also has no use for cameras. He represents a district dominated by Orthodox Jewish voters, and his priority this session was to persuade the city and state to foot the bill to bus any child past 4 p.m., which in effect means mostly children who attend yeshivas. Mr. Felder and Mr. Golden succeeded in pushing through this legislation, which will cost the city $5.6 million this year.         \n\nAs the state senators are not unreasonable men, they even offered to bargain: they might allow speed cameras if Mr. Bloomberg agreed to foot the bill for this busing program.         \n\nThe mayor said no. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said no. But when his state budget emerged from behind closed doors in Albany it included this new and costly busing program.         \n\nThe Orthodox, who are adroit at pulling the levers of power, and their political allies claim all children could benefit. But that argument is evidence-starved. The state paid for a pilot program this year, and city school buses have picked up 1,000 children \u2014 from 29 yeshivas and one  \n.         \n\nSenator Golden, who has charted the growth of the Orthodox population in his district, shrugs off criticism. It is, he said, \u201cthe new normal.\u201d         \n\nThose three words came laden with many meanings this past week.
