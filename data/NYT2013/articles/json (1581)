{"headline": "A Lost Generation: Young Syrian Refugees Struggle to Survive", "body": "\nSABHA, Jordan \u2014 The parents were petrified the oldest of their seven children would be drafted into the Syrian Army. For their teenage girl, they feared rape and kidnapping. And the next oldest, verging on adolescence, had begun rabble-rousing at school and in the street against the government.         \n\nSo in September 2011, six months into the uprising against President  \n of  \n, the parents sent the three children \u2014 then 15, 13 and 11 \u2014 away from home in Hama Province with about $425 and a tent sewed out of Chinese rice sacks. The children have lived on their own in Jordan ever since. The eldest, now 17, picks vegetables for $8.50 a day when he can; the girl has learned to cook; the younger boy kicks a ball or plays cards. He has no actual cards, so he made his own, writing numbers on scraps of paper.         \n\n\u201cI used to just be a child \u2014 now I\u2019m the head of the house,\u201d said the 17-year-old, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified to protect his family in Syria. \u201cI need a budget and to manage my money. I never thought of that before.\u201d         \n\nAs the Syrian civil war rages into its third year, nearly one-third of the population of 22 million inside Syria  \nand 1.4 million have fled their homeland altogether. Of about 500,000 \n, about 55 percent are under 18. Their troubles and challenges \u2014 years out of school, trauma from having witnessed the killing of relatives, sexual abuse \u2014 mirror those of their peers struggling to survive in tents and hideaways in Turkey, Iraq, Lebanon and Syria\u2019s own shattered communities.         \n\nThese children, the next lost generation, make up a particularly troubling category of collateral damage from Syria\u2019s chaotic conflict, which has left 70,000 people dead. There is Ahmad Ojan, 14, who wanted to be a teacher, but now spends his days peddling tea in Jordan\u2019s sprawling Zaatari refugee camp. And there is Marwa Hutaba, 15, who still hopes to be a pharmacist, but is increasingly worried she might be married off to a wealthy foreigner \u2014 like the 14-year-old who disappeared from school after \u201cgetting engaged one day and married the next.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWhen you talk to them about the future,\u201d said Carolyn Miles, chief executive of  \n, \u201cthey can\u2019t see beyond, frankly, the next day.\u201d         \n\nChildren have been streaming across Syria\u2019s borders for more than two years, thousands of them separated from their families. Even those accompanied by their parents arrive traumatized:  \n found that three out of four Syrian youngsters had lost a loved one in the fighting.         \n\nBefore the war, more than 90 percent of Syrian children were enrolled in school; in Jordan about one in three of the refugees ages 6 to 14 attend class. The rest are left to learn the life of an exile, where guile and aggression matter more than books and tests. Where there is little to look forward to, only now.         \n\nIn Zaatari, children dodge tear gas at  \n. They shake down water tankers to get their buckets filled first. They throw stones at aid workers. Gangs have formed, looting doors and windows from trailers and busting through fences.         \n\n\u201cNine-year-olds are coming to the swings armed: that\u2019s a serious issue that we have to deal with every day,\u201d said Jane MacPhail, Unicef\u2019s coordinator for Jordan\u2019s camps. \u201cYour brain changes. Your ability to assess risk goes. What we have to do is reconnect these kids\u2019 neuropathways to their emotional brain. Otherwise we\u2019re going to lose this generation.\u201d         \n\nThis small desert nation of six million opened its doors to the newcomers but was quickly overwhelmed as they gobbled up jobs, taxed scarce water resources and forced schools into double shifts. About two-thirds of the refugees are squatting in Jordanian cities and villages, but the pathos and problems are most profound in  \n, where families live in row after mind-numbing row of tents or trailers, each day an endless cycle of finding food and water, clearing dust and debris, waiting in lines. The camp opened last July and now sprawls across five square miles, costs $1 million a day to run and has a population of perhaps 120,000 \u2014 by far the region\u2019s largest hub of refugees.         \n\nIt is a vast jungle of humanity, and disorder. Electricity is pirated. Rations are brazenly bought and resold right outside distribution centers. Riots break out many mornings at three sites where the  \n hands out half a million pieces of pita, as boys scale barbed-wire fences to skirt the lines.         \n\nIt is home, school, play \u2014 life \u2014 for these displaced children of Syria.         \n\nAhmad Ojan, 14, whose father died a decade ago, arrived with his mother and several siblings three months ago from Dara\u2019a. Each morning, just after 6, he heads to the bread line with a thermos of hot tea, which he sells for 15 cents a cup.         \n\n\u201cChai b\u2019hayl,\u201d tea with cardamom, he calls in a slightly mournful wail. A few other boys pass with similar thermoses. An old man has one, too.         \n\nOn a good day, Ahmad can make $8 to $10, refilling his thermos four times. After the bread line, he sells at the registration compound, trading tips about surviving in Zaatari for news from the front lines. Around sunset, he plies the endless, unregulated marketplace of corrugated tin stalls.
