{"headline": "A Trip to Camp to Break a Tech Addiction", "body": "\nThere was a phantom buzzing in my shorts. I had carried my iPhone in my left front pocket for so many years that my jeans have permanent rectangular fade marks over my thigh. By now the phone is almost an extension of my nervous system; even without the thing on my person, I could still feel it tingle like a missing limb.         \n\nBut my phone was stapled inside a Trader Joe\u2019s bag along with my watch, credit card and ID. Any buzzing I felt was surely imagined.         \n\nThen again, it could have been a mosquito.         \n\nThis was Day 2 at  \n, an adults-only summer camp held on former Boy Scouts quarters in Navarro, Calif., about two and a half hours north of San Francisco. A little more than 300 people had gathered there for three days of color wars, talent shows, flag-raisings and other soothingly regressive activities organized by  \n, an Oakland-based group dedicated to teaching technology-addled (or technology-addicted) people to, in the words of its literature, \u201cdisconnect to reconnect.\u201d         \n\nThe rules of Camp Grounded were simple: no phones, computers, tablets or watches; work talk, discussion of people\u2019s ages and use of real names were prohibited.         \n\nThere was a reason such strictures seemed appealing. A year ago, I was an editor at a news blog. My days started at the office at 7:30 a.m., where I routinely worked through lunch until 6:30 p.m. I was compelled to follow 1,200 Twitter users, skim 180 RSS feeds and edit dozens of posts a day on an ever-accelerating conveyor belt of content that would have made Lucy and Ethel choke. Evenings were a chance to catch up on \u201cimportant\u201d television shows between skimming Twitter.         \n\nThe work-life crises of the meth dealer Walter White on \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d and the advertising executive Don Draper on \u201cMad Men\u201d (or, when I was feeling particularly dark, Dexter Morgan, the serial killer on \u201cDexter\u201d) were amplified, better art-directed versions of my own 24/7 grind. At night, the iPhone was docked beside my bed, making me feel that even as I slept, I was on the banks of the data stream just in case anything important \u2014 or anything at all \u2014 happened.         \n\nAfter a few months, my hands became numb and I asked my doctor for a chest X-ray because I was convinced I had pneumonia. I was beyond burned out: I was scorched, like a marshmallow on a stick held too close to the fire.         \n\nAt Camp Grounded, however, we would no longer be bloggers, entrepreneurs, lawyers, consultants or any other title; we were just ourselves (in my case, answering to \u201cBrooklyn\u201d). By removing the things that supposedly \u201cconnect\u201d us in this wireless, oversharing, humble-bragging age, the founders of Digital Detox hoped to build real connections that run deeper than following one another on Twitter or \u201cliking\u201d someone\u2019s photo on Instagram.         \n\nWithout the distractions of the Web, social media, television and breaking news, campers, who, according to organizers, ranged in age from 19 to 67, were invited to share with one another and learn about ourselves.         \n\nAll of which started immediately upon driving up to the camp. Cars were met at the gate and we were greeted by counselors whose grinning positivity reminded me of that scene in the 1981 movie \u201cTicket to Heaven\u201d in which a reluctant recruit to a religious cult was met with a chant of \u201cBomb With Love!\u201d         \n\nI had had a long, twisty ride up the mountain to get to the camp, and wasn\u2019t prepared for so much full-body enthusiasm, especially not the hugs. Normally, I find myself pressed up against strangers only during my morning subway commute, and usually that\u2019s no cause for smiles.         \n\nWhat was I getting myself into?         \n\n\u201cMy goal now is to connect people,\u201d Levi Felix, Digital Detox\u2019s 28-year-old co-founder, told me. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be more media, more to do outside of where you are. The only moment that matters is right now.\u201d         \n\nMr. Felix, whose camp name was Fidget Wigglesworth, is part of an emerging shift toward mindfulness among users of technology. Rather than merely accept social media\u2019s intrusion on relationships, and the small, distancing lens onto experience that smartphones and tablets have become for many of us, some tech-savvy folks are rethinking their attachment to electronic devices.
