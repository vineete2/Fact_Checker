{"headline": "Who Knew That Greenwich, Conn., Was a Model of Equality?", "body": "\nManuel Bonilla looked at me, confused. I had just asked him if he worried about entering his son into the Greenwich, Conn., public-school system. Greenwich, of course, is one of the wealthiest towns in America, home to hedge-fund billionaires like Steven A. Cohen, who has a world-renowned art collection and had a private ice rink. Bonilla is a handyman whose family struggles to make the rent. Wasn\u2019t he just a little concerned that his child would feel self-conscious?         \n\nNo, Bonilla told me. In Greenwich schools, he said, \u201cthey teach ice-skating.\u201d His wife, Veronica Llerena, who works as a housekeeper and a cashier at a Peruvian restaurant, added, \u201cThey have everything \u2014 music, sports, art, drama.\u201d She and Bonilla, who farmed a small plot in El Ejido in Andalusia, recently left because \u201cin Spain, he has no future,\u201d Bonilla said, pointing at their 4-year-old son, Manuel Jr., who was sleeping in his mother\u2019s arms. In Greenwich, they thought he did.         \n\nThe Bonillas were sitting with other low-income families in the immaculate Greenwich Head Start building. I had long known that Greenwich \u2014 with its grand estates \u2014 was ground zero for the 1 percent, but I was surprised to learn that nearly 4 percent of its residents live below the poverty line. \u201cIt takes a lot of labor to run those estates,\u201d says Bob Arnold, president of Family Centers, a nonprofit social-service agency there. \u201cThey need housekeepers, cooks, landscapers.\u201d I figured that many of those lower-income workers commuted from nearby places like White Plains, N.Y., or Stamford, Conn., where the rents are much cheaper. And many certainly do, but Arnold told me that the families who opt to live just on the Greenwich side of the New York border or in the apartments above the stores on Greenwich Avenue, fit a very specific profile: they pay the costs to have access to the schools that Greenwich\u2019s high property-tax base affords.         \n\nWhat Greenwich doesn\u2019t have is an abundance of affordable housing. Megan Sweeney, a director at Family Centers, explained that information about them is often guarded by family members or close friends. The Bonillas moved to Greenwich only because Veronica\u2019s sister, Mercy Llerena, a manager of a private estate, went there from White Plains after marrying a man in town. Another woman I met, Estella Rozende, an immigrant from Brazil, learned about Greenwich from a family friend who has helped dozens get started there.         \n\nThe Bonillas and Rozende felt lucky to have children in Greenwich. But historically speaking, researchers haven\u2019t been so sure that it is beneficial to enroll low-income children in wealthier schools. A lot of sociological data, dating to the definitive Coleman Report of 1966, which studied the outcomes of 570,000 students, show that a child\u2019s success in school, more than anything, was determined by her parents\u2019 wealth and education level. So in the decades after the report was issued, attention was lavished on various reforms and integrating schools according to race, not economics.         \n\nNew research, however, suggests that economic integration may be the answer. Recently, Heather Schwartz, a policy researcher at the RAND Corporation, began studying the public-school system of Montgomery County, Md. The county, a suburb of Washington, has one of the most affluent populations in America and an innovative housing authority that allows low-income citizens to rent homes alongside wealthier neighbors at steeply discounted prices. The renters are randomly assigned to different parts of the county; some Montgomery County schools have many poor students, others have almost none. In 2009, Schwartz concluded that students from poor families did much better in predominantly wealthy schools than in predominantly poor ones. On average, the poorer children in wealthier schools cut their achievement gap in half compared with their peers in poorer schools.         \n\nThe same thing is happening at Greenwich High. Around 13 percent of the school\u2019s students receive free or discounted lunches, a commonly used proxy for low income. And more than three-quarters of those students scored at or above proficiency on the most recent statewide 10th-grade performance tests. At nearby Stamford High School, where nearly 47 percent of students are on the lunch program, almost half the students failed to meet proficiency levels.
