{"headline": "Why Am I Dining Out So Often?", "body": "\nThey were counting us out. They figured it was the millennials who were going to come in and save their bacon. But at the end of the day who\u2019s filling up the booths at T.G.I. Fridays? Who\u2019s getting the  \n breakfast at Denny\u2019s? Who\u2019s dialing up for pizza because, really, who feels like cooking tonight?         \n\nBaby boomers, that\u2019s who.         \n\nA recent  \n by a market research company, the NPD Group, found that over the last five years, restaurant visits by boomers and older Americans have grown steadily, while those by millennials (basically people under 30) have declined.         \n\nIt wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way.         \n\nBonnie Riggs, NPD\u2019s restaurant industry analyst, said the assumption had been that baby boomers would follow traditional patterns and spend less on dining out as they got older. \u201cSo even though there are a lot of them,\u201d she said, \u201cthey were not going to provide the support to the industry that they had when they were younger. Well, lo and behold, that turned out not to be true.\u201d         \n\nWe\u2019ll get to why that might be in a moment, but first a word of reassurance for our millennial friends: we are not trying to pick a fight. We know it has been a tough week for you. Just the other day, the folks at the Institute of Politics at Harvard put out a  \n describing you as disillusioned with major institutions and turned off by politicians. If you feel like just staying home and eating ramen, we understand.         \n\nBut we\u2019re heading out! Cause that\u2019s what we boomers do.         \n\nIn fact, that might help explain why older Americans now are hitting restaurants at an age when many people before them were slowing down. \u201cThe baby boomers, not surprisingly, are America\u2019s most-experienced restaurant generation,\u201d said Hudson Riehle, a senior vice president at the  \n. (They also helped fuel the take-out food market, so the next time you see a  \n bearing down on you, thank a boomer.)         \n\nSimple economics also plays a role. Many boomers are retiring later than people did in generations before them, giving them more disposable income. And they are also likely to be earning more than younger people, many of whom have been especially hard hit by the economic downturn.         \n\nBut some if it comes down to attitude. \u201cThe boomers happen to be very different than their predecessors,\u201d Ms. Riggs said. \u201cThey act younger. They eat younger. They want to live forever.\u201d         \n\nThat seems unlikely to happen. In fact, restaurant owners who want to keep boomers\u2019 business will have to think about things like readable menus for aging eyes and reduced ambient noise for aging ears, experts say. They will also need to make sure the furniture is comfortable. And a restaurant association study suggests that they may need to tread carefully when it comes to restaurant features that appeal to younger people, like electronic ordering systems at tables.         \n\nThe NPD study found that boomers and older people have increased their share of restaurant traffic by six percentage points, while Millennials have decreased their share by the same amount. This suggests, the group said, that restaurants that had been aiming their marketing at the younger audience need to rethink their approach.         \n\nOne of the ways NPD measures consumer behavior is with a longstanding survey involving 3,000 people at a time. \u201cWe go out every day and ask them what they did yesterday,\u201d Ms. Riggs said.         \n\nThis, of course, may pose a problem for many boomers:         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/booming/baby-boomer-restaurant-visits-are-up.html", "date": "2013-05-09", "description": "It was supposed to be younger people who were driving the restaurant business these days while baby boomers slinked back to their kitchens, but it has not worked out that way."}
