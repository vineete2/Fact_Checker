{"headline": "On the Ground in Mali, French and Local Troops Confront Islamist Forces", "body": "\nBAMAKO, Mali \u2014 French soldiers are battling Islamist militants in direct clashes on the ground in central  \n, Malian and Western officials said on Wednesday, acknowledging for the first time that  \n\u2019s campaign against the militants who have seized much of the nation has involved more than just airstrikes.         \n\nFrance had said that its ground forces had stayed out of the fighting so far, limiting its intervention in Mali to aerial assaults at the front lines and bombing runs on extremist strongholds deeper into the Islamist-held north.         \n\nBut diplomats at the United Nations Security Council said on Wednesday that 30 to 40 French special forces troops landed in central Mali last Thursday and joined Malian soldiers in ground combat against the militants almost immediately.         \n\nThe French troops had been sent in as spotters to help French bombers find their targets, the diplomats said, but after the Malian forces alongside them faced an intense militant onslaught, the French troops suddenly found themselves engaged in skirmishes last Friday.         \n\n\u201cOur enemies were well armed, well equipped, well trained and determined,\u201d said a senior French diplomat.         \n\nBeyond that, a Malian colonel said that his army\u2019s ground troops had joined French forces on Wednesday and ringed the village of Diabaly, which Islamist fighters had seized the day before. Now, he said, they were trying to extricate the militants, who had taken over homes and ensconced themselves, managing to stay put despite hours of airstrikes by French warplanes the night before.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very specialized kind of war,\u201d the colonel said about the effort to dislodge the militants. \u201cThe town is surrounded.\u201d         \n\nThe fighting took place for much of the day, another top-ranking Malian officer said, confirming that French ground forces had engaged in combat alongside Malian soldiers against the jihadists entrenched in Diabaly.         \n\nThe Islamists overran Diabaly and a nearby Malian Army outpost on Monday despite heavy air bombardment by French planes and helicopter gunships, embarrassing the French, who had said they had blunted the Islamist advance into southern Mali.         \n\nSince then, French officials have acknowledged that bombing alone would not be enough to drive out the Islamist fighters who have advanced ever further into Mali, but they have typically been reluctant to say when exactly ground operations would begin.         \n\nPresident  \n of France has been blunt about his overall intentions, however. \u201cWhat do we plan to do with the terrorists?\u201d he said on Tuesday. \u201cDestroy them. Capture them, if possible, and make sure that they can do no harm in the future.\u201d         \n\n \n is moving quickly toward a deeper engagement in Mali, trying to stabilize the south while hitting hard with air power at Islamist bases and concentrations in the north. France is building up its troops in Mali to 2,500 from 800 now, and officials made it clear that those troops would take the fight to the rebels along with Malian forces.         \n\nOther African nations have pledged troops, the Security Council diplomats said, including Togo, Nigeria, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Niger, Benin and Chad. The question is whether they are operational.
