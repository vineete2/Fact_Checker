{"headline": "Shy No More, N.R.A.\u2019s Top Gun Sticks to Cause", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Victims of the massacre in Newtown, Conn., had just been laid to rest when  \n, the chief executive of the  \n, met with his board of directors in early January. A national tide of grief had prompted new attacks on his group and a White House push for more gun control measures, while Mr. LaPierre \u2014 who had called for armed guards in every school \u2014 was pilloried as a \u201c \n\u201d on the cover of The New York Post.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why the N.R.A. or the Second Amendment and lawful gun owners have to somehow end up in a story every time some crazy person goes off and kills children,\u201d he complained to Cleta Mitchell, a board member, who says Mr. LaPierre was \u201chorrified\u201d by the deaths and \u201cinsanely angry\u201d that he and the N.R.A. were being blamed.         \n\n\u201cThese people are out to get us and the Second Amendment,\u201d she recalls him telling the board, \u201cand we\u2019re not going to let them.\u201d         \n\nNow, as the Senate takes up gun control measures, the no-compromise strategy Mr. LaPierre has honed over his 35 years with the association is facing its most difficult test in decades. Lawmakers may defy Mr. LaPierre by extending background checks on some gun purchases, which the N.R.A.  \n. But since that grim January planning meeting, Mr. LaPierre has prevented what he and his group feared most: bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.         \n\nThough Mr. LaPierre has long been on the public stage, today he provokes perhaps more debate than ever about who exactly he is. Supporters see him as a steadfast Second Amendment purist; critics cast him as a paranoid figure who believes, as he said last year, in \u201ca massive Obama conspiracy\u201d to seize the nation\u2019s firearms or as a cynical mouthpiece who is paid nearly $1 million a year to warn of crackdowns and crises he knows will never come.         \n\n\u201cWayne reminds me of the clowns at the circus,\u201d one of his most vocal detractors, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut, said after his state passed new gun control laws this month. \u201cThey get the most attention. That\u2019s what he\u2019s paid to do.\u201d         \n\nOnce so bookish that he was known for his copious note-taking and so clumsy with a gun that colleagues laughed at his shooting, Mr. LaPierre, 64, helped invent the modern N.R.A. and transformed himself along with it into a right-wing folk hero and a reliable source of polarizing statements.         \n\nLiberals search for explanations as to how a man who is no one\u2019s idea of a highly polished spokesman can be so effective, and they accuse Mr. LaPierre of buying influence with campaign cash and intimidating lawmakers by \u201cscoring,\u201d or issuing public report cards, on how they vote. But what his critics often overlook is the iron relationship Mr. LaPierre has forged with many N.R.A. members.         \n\nWeek after week, year after year, he is on the road, traveling to gun shows and hotel ballroom fund-raisers, where he dispenses affirmation and absolution, telling firearms enthusiasts that their N.R.A. ties have nothing to do with violence and everything to do with freedom.         \n\nThe attendees form a ready-made base that Mr. LaPierre can draw on whenever he sees a threat to gun rights, and after spending much of his career building the membership \u2014 now nearly five million, the group says \u2014 he knows it well.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got one guy on our committee, he\u2019s 72 years old, he\u2019s got a two-foot-long gray ponytail, and twice Wayne has picked him out at the national convention to give him a hug, to say, \u2018You\u2019re my trouper,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Gary Kamp, a judge in Cape Girardeau, Mo., who helped host a recent \u201c \n\u201d dinner there for educational and training charities.         \n\nN.R.A. members admire Mr. LaPierre, who declined to be interviewed for this article, as \u201ca guy who will never fold,\u201d said Grover Norquist, the antitax crusader who is another board member.         \n\n\u201cWe are so used to electing politicians who go to Washington, D.C., and trim their sails and trade favors and do things they say they would never do,\u201d Mr. Norquist said. \u201cIf you are going to ask people to write $25 checks, you have to signal to people, \u2018I\u2019m not folding; don\u2019t you think about folding.\u2019 And him not folding reminds everybody that we haven\u2019t given up.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nThree months and a day after the Newtown massacre, Mr. LaPierre, dressed in his trademark business suit and starched white shirt, arrived with a security detail at a convention hall overlooking the Potomac for the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, a gathering of thousands of activists sponsored, in part, by the N.R.A.         \n\nFrom the earliest days after the shooting, Mr. LaPierre had been working to counter any legislative impact: sowing concerns about background checks, which in the late 1990s he supported; introducing his \u201cNational School Shield\u201d plan to arm teachers, administrators and other school personnel; and making sure his base felt protected as the national trauma sank in.
