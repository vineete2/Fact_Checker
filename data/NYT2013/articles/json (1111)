{"headline": "After Hurricane Sandy, Reclaiming Christmas", "body": "\nOn the first day of December, from the time the children were little, I hung the Advent calendar on the door to the laundry room. I never liked that calendar much. It was ordinary, made of cloth, maybe three feet long with 25 pockets. Each day, as we counted the time left until Christmas, our four children, starting with the youngest, took turns filling another pocket with a small toy or candy cane or reindeer, and then finally, on Christmas morning, Santa\u2019s head.         \n\nI would have preferred a medieval-style cathedral made of wood with 25 hinged doors, or a cardboard gothic church with 25 stained-glass windows, but I had learned the hard way the perils of having fragile things within easy reach of small, curious hands.         \n\nBy the time the kids were old enough and I could have picked out something nicer, our Advent calendar had become a habit, carried down from the attic, dusted off and hung on that laundry-room door without a lot of thought.         \n\nThen, two Christmases ago, the wooden handle it hung by snapped in half, and I didn\u2019t think it was worth fixing. After the holiday, around the time the kids headed back to their colleges and jobs \u2014 they now range in age from 18 to 23 \u2014 I tossed it, planning to buy something special in the new year.         \n\nBut I didn\u2019t. I forgot. Or maybe I should say I was blindsided. Where we live, in Lido Beach, N.Y., on the island of Long Beach, Christmas 2012 will long be known as the  \n Christmas.         \n\nOur house was flooded with a foot of seawater. The entire downstairs \u2014 kitchen, living room, dining room, TV room, mudroom, two bedrooms, two full bathrooms, and various closets and hallways \u2014 had to be gutted, down to the concrete slabs. We lost 11 inside doors, and that, of course, included the door to the laundry room.         \n\nWe do count ourselves lucky. No one died in Long Beach. In many ways the community came together, with those who lost some things helping those who lost everything. Friends and family took us in and fed us in the early days after the storm, and once we were back on our feet, we volunteered for months, delivering food and clothing around town.         \n\nThrough it all, we had an upstairs to live in. When the children came home, the six of us spent most of the holiday crowded into two rooms. I became an expert at cooking scrambled eggs on a hot plate and washing dishes in the bathroom sink.         \n\nBut it didn\u2019t look much like Christmas.         \n\nThere were no decorations because there was no room. Friends who visited brought us a stuffed holiday stocking, which I placed on a bookcase.         \n\nMy usual \u201cWhite Christmas\u201d singalong party for the women in my family, our female friends and our daughters was canceled; everyone was too scattered by the flood. My two daughters and I like to bake while listening to our stack of holiday CDs. Christmas morning is always Handel\u2019s \u201cMessiah.\u201d         \n\nThere wasn\u2019t much music last Christmas. My husband lost many of his records in the flood, along with the Christmas CDs that were stored on lower shelves.         \n\nTo try to hold onto a little festivity, we took rooms for two nights at an inn on the East End of Long Island that had been untouched by the storm. The drive out east at night was surreal. The Ocean Parkway, which runs along Jones Beach, was being rebuilt, and detour lights shone as bright as day in the dark night. Driving through the middle of the island was unsettling, passing through neighborhoods that were still intact and houses decorated with holiday lights, when our own neighborhood was still so devastated.         \n\nAt the inn, our Christmas tree was plastic: three feet tall, pre-lit and sprayed silver. On Christmas Day, my older daughter and I watched \u201cChristmas in Connecticut,\u201d with Barbara Stanwyck, but it was kind of depressing.         \n\nSo this Christmas we feel our good fortune as never before. Our house has been repaired. Within the city of Long Beach, most stores are lit and stocked, much of the infrastructure is fixed and  \n and adorned with festive lights.         \n\nOur family has reclaimed much of our Christmas. We hosted a party for friends and family in our refurbished TV room. The hot plate is gone, and my daughters and I are baking again.         \n\nLost in the flood was the \u201cBetter Homes and Gardens Cook Book\u201d that I received as a wedding present nearly 30 years ago. But I was able to go to the magazine\u2019s website and find most of what I needed. For brunch on Christmas morning, I plan to serve bagels, lox and the ripest tomatoes I can find in December, as well as Irish bacon, scrambled eggs and French toast casserole.         \n\nA few weeks ago, my oldest went into the attic for the Christmas decorations and couldn\u2019t find the Advent calendar. In the chaos last year, she hadn\u2019t noticed it was gone. When I explained about the broken handle, she actually used the word \u201ccrestfallen.\u201d (She was an English major in college.) I\u2019d been slow to pick up on it, but somewhere along the line, that worn calendar had been transformed from habit to family tradition.         \n\nAs I write, we are about to go out and buy a new Advent calendar, although it won\u2019t be as fancy as I\u2019d once envisioned. Since the flood, money has been tight.         \n\nAdvent, of course, is all about waiting. The world over, children are waiting for the big day, waiting to celebrate the baby Jesus\u2019 birth, waiting for Santa and, yes, waiting for presents.         \n\nAnd still, our town is not fully restored. As many as a quarter of the residents have not returned to their homes. They are waiting for insurance money, waiting for government appeals, waiting for the day when a new concrete foundation will be poured. There is hope here, but also anger and sorrow, and despair, as people wait for Christmas to be Christmas again.
