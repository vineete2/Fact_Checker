Members of Congress from both parties have joined in the effort, directed at an obscure but increasingly powerful agency, the  \n, which has written and must approve some of the most contentious provisions.         \n\nBanks and overseas regulators are resisting an agency proposal, intended to go into full effect as early as mid-July, that would require overseas offices of American-based banks, foreign institutions and hedge funds to turn over information on foreign trades if they involve United States customers, or are guaranteed by a financial institution with American ties, requirements that the industry calls redundant and excessive.         \n\nThe battle \u2014 led by high-powered lawyers and lobbyists, including former top regulators and Congressional staff members, like a former aide to retired Representative Barney Frank, a chief author of the law \u2014 has played out in hundreds of meetings with  \n, the chairman of the commission, other commission members and major players on Capitol Hill.         \n\nIt has divided Democrats in Congress, caused strains in the commission and provoked public charges by industry officials that Mr. Gensler is overreaching his authority and private complaints that he is \u201creckless\u201d and \u201cstubborn.\u201d         \n\nA former investment banker, Mr. Gensler defends his proposals, arguing that too many bad bets in the global derivatives market can be traced to overseas locations \u2014 including the $6 billion loss last year by a JPMorgan Chase trader called the  \n \u2014 and threatened markets in the United States.         \n\n\u201cIt would be letting down the American public if we said, we are just about to complete the task but now, let\u2019s retreat,\u201d Mr. Gensler said in an interview. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do this right, we will blow a hole in the bottom of the boat of reform.\u201d         \n\n \nthat the proposals, called the cross-border guidance, will inevitably produce conflicts with foreign regulators and perhaps even drive trading away from Wall Street banks to competitors overseas.         \n\n\u201cWe should all care, because that cost will have to be passed on, in the form of higher prices for products sold to consumers or a lower return for investors,\u201d said  \n., a former House lawmaker turned financial industry lobbyist, whose organization Sifma has urged Mr. Gensler to compromise on the cross-border rules.         \n\nSome of the strongest objections have come from foreign regulators, including officials from Britain, Russia, Japan and Germany, who complained about the plan last month in a letter to Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew. Global markets, \n \u201cwill not be able to function under such burdensome regulatory conditions,\u201d advocating instead that the United States agree to respect rules each nation adopts, assuming they are reasonably compatible.         \n\nMary L. Schapiro, who recently stepped down as chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said she admired Mr. Gensler for his doggedness. But, she noted, \u201che believes very strongly in the positions he takes \u2014 that does not always lend itself to compromise quickly.\u201d         \n\nThe S.E.C., which has jurisdiction over a much smaller share of derivatives trading than Mr. Gensler\u2019s agency,  \n consider a narrower cross-border requirement on Wednesday. With American regulators in disagreement, the industry could have more leverage.         \n\nThe role of Mr. Gensler\u2019s agency greatly expanded under Dodd-Frank, which called for significantly tighter regulation of derivatives, used by a broad array of companies to help manage risk. An airline, for instance, uses them to hedge against the fluctuating cost of jet fuel. One form of derivatives,  \n, helped topple the giant insurer  \n in 2008, deepening the financial crisis.         \n\nIn the fight over the law\u2019s provisions, the commission has been outmatched, said  \n, one of three Democratic appointees on the panel. \u201cThey have really unlimited resources,\u201d he said of industry officials. Rules expected to take one year in the making have stretched out to three.         \n\n\u201cIt has created what I call dysfunction junction,\u201d he added.         \n\nBank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase were among the first to weigh in.  \n a former general counsel at the commodity commission and now a partner at the New York-based law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, said the plan would damage his clients in overseas markets, as foreign customers would start to avoid American banks. JPMorgan Chase alone had $70 trillion of derivatives outstanding at the end of last year, a large portion of which were booked overseas.         \n\n \n, a former Securities and Exchange Commission member and now a lawyer at Davis Polk & Wardwell, whose clients include Goldman Sachs and an industry trade association, said that foreign regulators, in most cases, should be able to oversee transactions that take place in their own nations, including those handled by American-based banks.         \n\n\u201cYou might have Citibank London doing business with a Swiss branch of a Dutch bank,\u201d Ms. Nazareth said in an interview. \u201cThat is the kind of stuff that is coming up every day.\u201d         \n\nThe protests by the banks have been reinforced by dozens of members of Congress, who have written letters complaining to Mr. Gensler, introduced legislation to try to block the cross-border plan and questioned him about the proposal.
