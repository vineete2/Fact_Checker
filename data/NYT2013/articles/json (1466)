{"headline": "The Proper Way to Eat a Pig", "body": "\nOn a recent morning in Portland, Ore., Camas Davis was teaching nine high-school kids how to butcher a pig. A 17-year-old named Mady called dibs on the front trotter, slicing through the skin near the pig\u2019s ankle, then using a hand saw to cut through the bone. Nathan, 15, moved up the leg and worked through the hock, while Karina, 16, eyed the shoulder. Pushing up the sleeves of her red cardigan, she placed her blade between the fifth and sixth ribs, scored the flesh, then gave the knife a long pull, separating the shoulder from the carcass, but leaving intact the coppa \u2014 a muscle around the pig\u2019s neck \u2014 in case anyone wanted to roast it.         \n\nThe kids were wearing aprons over their jeans. When it wasn\u2019t their turn to butcher, they gossiped and texted friends photos of the dead pig, which was splayed out on a jigsaw of white cutting boards, its head sitting nearby, gazing on; its eyelids had been sliced off during an inspection for parasites. On a counter, industrial plastic bins were marked: bellies, loin/chops, shoulders/roasts, hams, bones/trotters/hocks. The students took turns removing the pig\u2019s feet and breaking the animal down into four \u201cprimals\u201d: shoulder, loin, belly and ham. Then Davis stepped in to show them how to butcher it into the cuts they\u2019d seen at the grocery store and the ones they hadn\u2019t. She picked up a leg, peeling off the skin with her blade, removing the \u201cH-bone,\u201d and then turned it toward her students. \u201cInstead of muscling through this,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m going to use the tip of my knife to feather through the fascia,\u201d the pig\u2019s connective tissue. Davis held the knife in a butcher\u2019s grip and delicately separated the muscle groups to reveal a roast. \u201cNow it\u2019s your turn.\u201d         \n\nButchery is a new course being offered by the Oregon Episcopal School, an independent preparatory academy that prides itself on \u201cinquiry-based learning.\u201d Each year, the week before spring break, called Winterim, is reserved for experimental education projects. Some students go dog-sledding in Minnesota. Others play Dungeons & Dragons or opt for an intensive course in the art of hat-making. Recently, an English teacher at the school, Kara Tambellini, read an article about the Portland Meat Collective and proposed a course on butchery.         \n\nAnd so Davis, who has taught butchery to mothers and young professionals, to beer brewers and bike messengers, but never to high schoolers, devised a weeklong curriculum that covered the basics. This included a field trip on a Friday, when she took the students to a local farm to meet and select a pig, whom they named Wilbur and then, realizing she was female, renamed Wilburess.         \n\nThe next Monday morning, the class met up with Wilburess again at a local slaughterhouse, along with her 30-year-old owner, Bubba King, who had a thick brown beard and bounced a 5-month-old baby named Ulysses on his hip. When the recession hit, King explained, he borrowed some farmland \u2014 though he had no previous farm experience \u2014 to raise pigs. He learned how to butcher them on YouTube. Eventually, he got in touch with Davis, who, through the Meat Collective, gave him a formal lesson. Now her students buy his hogs for their butchery courses. King sells them for $3.25 per pound of hanging weight, which is how much an animal weighs after it has been slaughtered, gutted and drained of its blood. Wilburess, at 171 pounds, earned him $536 \u2014 he gave the students a discount.         \n\n \n era, community-supported-agriculture shares \u2014 in which families purchase farm goods through a weekly subscription \u2014 have become increasingly popular. Nowhere is that more true than in Portland, where people take their food ethics, among other things, very seriously. There is a sketch in the first episode of the IFC comedy \u201cPortlandia\u201d in which characters played by Fred Armisen and Carrie Brownstein persistently nudge their waitress for information about the chicken on the menu. After asking if the chicken was raised organically and about the size of its roaming area, they find out that the chicken was named Colin and that it grew up on a farm 30 miles outside Portland; later Armisen is handed the chicken\u2019s citizenship papers. (The line between Portland and \u201cPortlandia\u201d often blurs; for example, Armisen gave the commencement address to Oregon Episcopal\u2019s graduating class.)
