{"headline": "Swarming a Book Online", "body": "\nReviews on  \n are becoming attack weapons, intended to sink new books as soon as they are published.         \n\nIn the biggest, most overt and most successful of these campaigns, a group of Michael Jackson fans used  \n and  \n to solicit negative reviews of a new biography of the singer. They bombarded Amazon with dozens of one-star takedowns, succeeded in getting several favorable notices erased and even took credit for Amazon\u2019s briefly removing the book from sale.         \n\n\u201cBooks used to die by being ignored, but now they can be killed \u2014 and perhaps unjustly killed,\u201d said Trevor Pinch, a Cornell sociologist who has studied Amazon reviews. \u201cIn theory, a very good book could be killed by a group of people for malicious reasons.\u201d         \n\nIn \u201cUntouchable: The Strange Life and Tragic Death of Michael Jackson,\u201d Randall Sullivan writes that Jackson\u2019s overuse of plastic surgery reduced his nose to little more than a pair of nostrils and that he died a virgin despite being married twice. These points in particular seem to infuriate the fans.         \n\nOutside Amazon, the book had a mixed reception; in The New York Times, Michiko Kakutani  \n \u201cthoroughly dispensable.\u201d So it is difficult to pinpoint how effective the campaign was. Still, the book has been a resounding failure in the marketplace.         \n\nThe fans, who call themselves Michael Jackson\u2019s Rapid Response Team to Media Attacks, say they are exercising their free speech rights to protest a book they feel is exploitative and inaccurate. \u201cSullivan does everything he can to dehumanize, dismantle and destroy, against all objective fact,\u201d a spokesman for the group said.         \n\nBut the book\u2019s publisher, Grove Press, said the Amazon review system was being abused in an organized campaign. \u201cWe\u2019re very reluctant to interfere with the free flow of discourse, but there should be transparency about people\u2019s motivations,\u201d said Morgan Entrekin, president of Grove/Atlantic, Grove\u2019s parent company.         \n\nAmazon said the fans\u2019 reviews had not violated its guidelines but declined further comment.         \n\nThe retailer, like other sites that depend on customer reviews, has been faced with the problem of so-called sock puppets, those people secretly commissioned by an author to produce favorable notices. In recent months, Amazon has made efforts to remove reviews by those it deemed too close to the author, especially relatives.         \n\nThe issue of attack reviews, though, has received little attention. The historian Orlando Figes was revealed in 2010 to be using Amazon to anonymously vilify his rivals and secretly praise himself. The crime writer R. J. Ellory was exposed for doing the same thing last fall.         \n\nAttack reviews are hard to police. It is difficult, if not impossible, to detect the difference between an authentic critical review and an author malevolently trying to bring down a colleague, or organized assaults by fans. Amazon\u2019s extensive rules on reviewing offer little guidance on what is permissible in negative reviews and what is not.         \n\nWith \u201cUntouchable,\u201d Grove had hopes for a modest best seller. The book was excerpted in Vanity Fair, and Mr. Sullivan, a longtime contributor to Rolling Stone who lives in Portland, Ore., promoted it on \u201cNightline\u201d and \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d Amazon selected it as one of the best books of November, encouraging readers to \u201ccheck out this train wreck of a life.\u201d The retailer also selected it as one of the 100 best e-books of the year.         \n\nNone of that helped when Mr. Sullivan tried to complain, saying reviews of his book were factually false yet being voted up by the fans so that they dominated the page for \u201cUntouchable.\u201d The bookseller replied with boilerplate. \u201cRest assured, we\u2019ll read each of the reviews and remove any that violate our guidelines,\u201d adding, \u201cWe\u2019ve appreciated your business and hope to have the opportunity to serve you again in the future.\u201d         \n\nIn an interview, Mr. Sullivan asked: \u201cShould people be allowed to make flagrantly false comments about the content of a book or its author? This is suppression of free speech in the name of free speech.\u201d         \n\n\u201cUntouchable\u201d is 586 pages of text, with 200 pages of notes. Much of it focuses on Jackson\u2019s chaotic last years, including his efforts at comebacks, his struggles to remain solvent, his shocking death in 2009 and the battle over his estate.
