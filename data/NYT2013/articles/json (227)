{"headline": "Remember All Those Passwords? No Need", "body": "\n\u201cIf you want to avoid having your identity stolen, use long passwords that contain digits, punctuation and no recognizable words. Make up a different password for every Web site. And change all of your passwords every 30 days.\u201d         \n\nHave these security pundits ever listened to themselves?         \n\nThat advice is clearly unfollowable. I currently have account names and passwords for 87 Web sites (banks, airlines, blogs, shopping, e-mail, Facebook, Twitter). How is anyone \u2014 even a security professional \u2014 supposed to memorize 87 long, complex password strings, let alone remember which goes with which Web site?         \n\nSo most people use the same password over and over again, and live with the guilt.         \n\nThere are solutions. Most Mac and Windows Web browsers now offer to memorize passwords for you. But that feature doesn\u2019t work on all Web sites, and is generally of little help when you pick up your phone or tablet. At that point, the only person you\u2019ve locked out of all your online accounts is you.         \n\nThe only decent solution is to install a dedicated password memorization program (like  \n,  \n,  \n,  \n, and so on). Last week, one of the best was just improved:  \n, now at 2.0. It\u2019s attractive, effective, loaded with timesaving features and available for Mac, Windows, iPhone and Android \u2014 and it\u2019s free.         \n\nInstallation is quick. Dashlane works in Safari, Chrome, Internet Explorer and Firefox. It can import existing password \u201cvaults\u201d from rival programs.         \n\nDashlane has two primary features. First, yes, it\u2019s a password memorizer. Every time you type your account name and password into a Web page and press enter, Dashlane pops up, offering to memorize that information and fill it in the next time.         \n\nIn fact, it also offers to log you in \u2014 not just to enter your password, but also to click \u201clog in\u201d for you. In effect, Dashlane has just removed the login blockade entirely. When you go to Facebook, Twitter or Gmail, you just click your bookmark, smile at the briefest flash of the login screen and arrive at the site.         \n\nSince Dashlane is now storing and auto-entering your passwords, you\u2019re now free to follow the security experts\u2019 advice. You can make up long, unguessable passwords \u2014 a different one for every Web site, since you don\u2019t have to remember any of them. In fact, each time you sign up for a new account, Dashlane offers to make up such a password for you, and then, of course, to memorize it.         \n\nDashlane\u2019s second huge feature is even more amazing. It can also fill in other kinds of Web site forms: your name/address/phone number, and even your credit card information.         \n\nWhen you\u2019re buying something online, and you click into the credit card number box, Dashlane displays  \nof your credit cards: Visa, MasterCard, American Express or whatever \u2014 even PayPal.         \n\nWhen you click the one you want to use, Dashlane instantly fills in the long card number, your name, the expiration date, even that accursed security code, in the right boxes. Every time you order something online, you save between 30 seconds and five minutes, depending on whether you have your card information memorized or have to go burrow through your wallet.         \n\nWhen you make a purchase, Dashlane even offers to store all the details in a digital receipt that you can call up later, along with a screenshot of the Web site where you shopped. This feature makes online shopping so frictionless, every dot-com retailer on earth ought to be promoting Dashlane as if its profits depended on it.         \n\nIn fact, Dashlane can fill in all kinds of forms automatically: phone numbers, job titles, tax numbers and so on. If you\u2019ve ever recorded multiple answers \u2014 you have two different Twitter accounts, say \u2014 two tidy buttons appear beneath the name box, bearing the account names. Click the one you want.         \n\nUnlike some rival programs, Dashlane doesn\u2019t require you to associate one set of personal information to each \u201cprofile.\u201d If you have three addresses, for example, you\u2019re always offered those three when filling in a form. You don\u2019t have to create three personalities\u2019 worth of personal information.         \n\nSo far, Dashlane probably seems designed for convenience, and that\u2019s true. Behind the scenes, of course, its ultimate goal is security.
