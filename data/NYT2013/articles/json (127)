{"headline": "Dispute Over Budget Deepens a Rift Within the G.O.P.", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Republicans are locked in a widening internal dispute over future budget negotiations, splitting along generational and ideological lines on the party\u2019s approach to the central issue that drove the conservative surge in the Obama era: how to deal with the federal debt.         \n\nIn full view of C-Span cameras trained on the floor this week, Senators  \n of Arizona and Susan Collins of Maine jousted with a new generation of conservatives \u2014  \n of Florida, Ted Cruz of Texas, Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky \u2014 over the party\u2019s refusal to allow the Senate to open budget talks with the House despite Senate Republicans\u2019 long call for Democrats to produce a budget.         \n\nIt was the Old Guard versus the  \n, but with real ramifications, as Congress careens toward another  \n and spending crisis this fall with seemingly no one at the steering wheel. The newer members say negotiations should go forward only with a binding precondition that a budget deal cannot raise the government\u2019s statutory borrowing limit.         \n\n\u201cI have tremendous respect for this institution,\u201d Mr. Rubio said in an interview on Friday. \u201cBut I\u2019m not all that interested in the way things have always been done around here.\u201d         \n\nRepublicans made the failure of Senate Democrats to pass a budget a central talking point in the 2012 campaign, going so far this year as to pass legislation withholding Congressional pay if budgets were not approved this spring. Now, some Republicans say the fact that members of their own party are standing in the way of a House-Senate conference committee undermines their fiscal message.         \n\n\u201cThis to me is an issue of integrity,\u201d said Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee. \u201cWe\u2019ve pressed for a budget. We ought to go to conference.\u201d         \n\nBut the budget hawks have not budged, and they have even taken aim at their party in strikingly critical language.         \n\n\u201cHere is the dirty little secret about some of those on the right side of the aisle,\u201d Mr. Cruz said of his fellow Republicans. \u201cThere are some who would very much like to cast a symbolic vote against raising the debt ceiling and nonetheless allow our friends on the left side of the aisle to raise the debt ceiling. That, to some Republicans, is the ideal outcome.\u201d         \n\nMr. McCain called the demands of his Republican colleagues \u201cabsolutely out of line and unprecedented.\u201d The Senate  \n before dawn on March 23 after a grueling all-night session, he noted, saying it was time to try to reach a final deal with the House in a negotiating conference.         \n\n\u201cWill this deliberative body, whether it is the greatest in the world or the worst in the world, go ahead and decide on this issue, so we can at least tell the American people we are going to do what we haven\u2019t done for four years and what every family in America sooner or later has to do \u2014 and that is to have a budget?\u201d he asked. Although few of Mr. McCain\u2019s colleagues took to the floor to join him, many have expressed similar views.         \n\nSenator Roy Blunt of Missouri, a member of the Republican leadership, said that at this point, resistance had to give.         \n\n\u201cI suspect senators have held back long enough on the decision to go to conference,\u201d he said.         \n\nRepublicans who have made the deficit their central ideological focus are, in some sense, the dog that caught the bus. The nonpartisan  \n estimated this month that the deficit for this fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, will fall to about $642 billion, or 4 percent of the nation\u2019s annual economic output, less than half the 2011 deficit and about $200 billion lower than the agency had estimated three months ago.         \n\nThe agency forecast that the deficit, which topped 10 percent of the gross domestic product in 2009, could shrink to as little as 2.1 percent of the G.D.P. by 2015, a level most analysts say would be easily sustainable over the long run.         \n\nAnd a conservative stamp is hitting the government, thanks to the across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration. On Friday, 115,000 employees at the Internal Revenue Service, Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Housing and Urban Development and the small Office of Management and Budget \u2014 5 percent of the federal work force \u2014 stayed home on unpaid furlough.         \n\nHouse Republicans had envisioned a plan to reach a comprehensive deficit reduction deal predicated on a showdown in July over the debt ceiling. That showdown was supposed to drive both sides back to the bargaining table, but a rapidly falling deficit, rising tax payments and huge infusions of cash from the newly profitable, federally controlled home financing agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have scrambled those plans. Now, the debt ceiling may not have to be raised until October or November, in the next fiscal year.         \n\nBefore then, unless a budget deal can be struck, Congress must pass bills to finance the government based on very different guidelines in the House- and Senate-passed plans. The House Appropriations Committee will have to draft a bill financing labor, health and education programs at $121.8 billion, a 19 percent cut from current levels even after the across-the-board cuts took effect. The bill to finance the Interior Department and Environmental Protection Agency cannot exceed $24.2 billion, down 15 percent from the current levels after the cuts.         \n\n\u201cThere is not a member of our committee, Republican or Democrat, who is happy with these numbers,\u201d said Jennifer Hing, a spokeswoman for the committee.         \n\nThe Senate has no intention of swallowing those cuts, so unless budget negotiators can meet and reach a deal, Congress will be headed back toward a crisis come Sept. 30, said Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the Senate Budget Committee chairwoman.         \n\n\u201cThey could create crisis by having a government shutdown or holding everything back until November and threatening a debt default. That would be to their political detriment,\u201d Ms. Murray said. \u201cI think the American people have had it with that kind of hostage-taking.\u201d         \n\nBut Mr. Rubio said that he was not about to give in, and that a single senator might have the power to hold back negotiations indefinitely. \u201cI\u2019m not sure this is an issue I can ever change my opinion on,\u201d he said.
