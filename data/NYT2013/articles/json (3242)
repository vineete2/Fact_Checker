{"headline": "Backing Off  \u2018Wanting It All\u2019  From a Spouse", "body": "\n \n         \n\nDeborah Anna Luepnitz, a psychoanalyst and seasoned couples therapist on the clinical faculty at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, said feminists unhappy in their relationships should recall the first tenet of women\u2019s liberation: don\u2019t look to a partner to provide happiness.         \n\nWomen deserve love and a satisfying partner, but expecting it all from one person \u2014 knee-knocking romance, dazzling intellectual stimulation, rock-solid economic security and a balanced spreadsheet of dishes washed \u2014 is a setup for unhappiness, said Dr. Luepnitz, who wrote  \n a seminal book about gender published in 1988 and still widely taught today.         \n\nDr. Luepnitz says that \u201cwanting it all,\u201d by either partner, also fosters criticism, which is demeaning and can block intimacy. Instead, she says friends can fill needs that partners may not.         \n\n\u201cSometimes what is lacking in your partner is what you lack yourself,\u201d she said.         \n\nArlene Petty, in last week\u2019s Unhitched column, found out that truth \u2014 but too late to save her marriage. With her children in college, her resentments about running the household and raising children while her husband worked long hours led her to ask for a separation.         \n\nDr. Luepnitz, however, says capitalism contributed to this couple\u2019s difficulties. \u201cAmerican society doesn\u2019t have an economic safety net: people need to work harder, and for longer,\u201d she said, noting that the retirement age has risen.         \n\nChanging who works and who cares for children can be impossible unless both parents have equal earning power; yet waiting until the \u201cgolden years\u201d to work on an ailing marriage can be dangerous.         \n\nRegarding Mr. Petty\u2019s bad experience in counseling, Dr. Luepnitz said she would have floated a rule of \u201cno dating during therapy.\u201d She would also have asked the couple to imagine their lives if they never met anyone better. Would they be happy alone? Or with someone less compatible?         \n\n\u201cOften people are convinced there\u2019s someone with all the good qualities of their current partner, plus everything they perceive to be missing,\u201d she said.         \n\nThis is rarely true; statistics show the divorce rate in first marriages hovers between 40 percent and 50 percent, and studies have shown the rate for second marriages is slightly higher.         \n\nA good therapist, Dr. Luepnitz said, digs into presenting problems to unearth issues rooted in the unconscious. She cited the instance of a woman passionate about poetry and classic books, angered by her husband\u2019s refusal to share her appetite for literature.         \n\nDuring courtship, she would provide him with a reading list. Before they married, he found this endearing. But over time, he felt berated by his wife\u2019s demands. \u201cAs if marriage was a continuing education class,\u201d Dr. Luepnitz said.         \n\nIn therapy, the woman made an important connection: her father was barely literate, and her mother had continually humiliated him about his poor grammar. Unconsciously, the woman had picked up her mother\u2019s shame, and echoed that behavior in her own marriage. Once Dr. Luepnitz\u2019s client saw the roots of her fixation, she felt \u201cunburdened.\u201d She reassured her husband that nothing was wrong with him and the relationship survived.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s danger in wanting someone to change too much, but I do advocate compromising,\u201d Dr. Luepnitz said. Say one partner wants to travel, the other might want to trade traveling for involvement in a new hobby.         \n\nAs for last week\u2019s divorced couple, Dr. Lupenitz lauds their generosity of spirit: They protected their children and didn\u2019t demonize each other. And they remained friends.         \n\n\u201cI would like to know them,\u201d she said.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/14/booming/backing-off-wanting-it-all-from-a-spouse.html", "date": "2013-11-14", "description": "Deborah Anna Luepnitz, a couples therapist, says an unhappy spouse can benefit by realizing that \u201csometimes what is lacking in your partner is what you lack yourself.\u201d"}
