{"headline": "What Do You Look for in Modern Translation?", "body": "\nEach week in Bookends, two writers take on pressing and provocative questions about the world of books. This week, Daniel Mendelsohn and Dana Stevens write about what they look for in modern translation.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \nDaniel Mendelsohn \n\n\u201cHe has Me beaten to my knees.\u201d By the time Lawrence of Arabia wrote those words, in June 1928, his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 was so dense with dashing military exploits that the casual reader would be forgiven for thinking he was referring to some cunning Ottoman general. But the \u201che\u201d in question was Homer. Six months into a new prose translation of the \u201cOdyssey,\u201d he had produced six drafts of his rendering of only the first 441 lines (out of some 12,000). \u201cI see now,\u201d he wrote miserably, \u201cwhy there are no adequate translations of Homer. He is baffling.\u201d         \n\n \n. Every text is, to some extent, a bafflement to its translator, because every language, like every writer, has characteristics that can\u2019t be \u201ccarried across\u201d \u2014 which is what \u201ctranslate\u201d means \u2014 into another tongue, another culture. (Think of words like \u201cchutzpah\u201d and \u201cchic.\u201d)  \n, the Italians pun: \u201cThe translator is a betrayer.\u201d Yet translations must be made.         \n\nAnd reviewed. What often baffles readers of book reviews are the standards applied in judging a translation. What qualities make a translation feel \u201cright\u201d? How important is faithfulness to the original? Do the same criteria apply equally to classic and contemporary works? Every critic has his or her own criteria. To my mind, no translation can work without the following:         \n\n \n. You can argue about the fine points of certain words, but some things aren\u2019t up for discussion. The Italian translator of one of my books thought the \u201c20-dollar bill\u201d one character handed to another on her deathbed referred to an invoice rather than a bank note, with results that inverted the meaning of the scene. But while insufficient accuracy is a problem, so, in a way, is too much accuracy. In the first lines of the new \u201cIliad\u201d by the distinguished Homer scholar Barry Powell, we meet a character called Chryses, a priest of Apollo. Powell renders  \n, a Greek word for \u201cpriest\u201d (literally, \u201cone who prays\u201d), as \u201ca praying man.\u201d But while this is correct, strictly speaking, it betrays the original: for English readers, \u201ca praying man\u201d is a devout individual, not an officiant at a religious ritual, which is what Chryses is.         \n\n \n. While it\u2019s often impossible to recreate elements like rhythm, rhyme and enjambment, to ignore them is another kind of betrayal. The fantastically precise meters and word positioning of the Roman poet Horace have confounded translators for centuries; but no serious translator would render his famously lapidary lyrics as (say) free verse dribbling down the page, because in Horace, the formal meticulousness is inextricable from his message, his cautious ethics (this is the poet who gave us \u201c \n\u201d). The translator must be intimate with the author\u2019s larger outlook, not just the \u201cwords.\u201d         \n\n \n. Good translators work hard to bring across the feel of the original writing: the liquid smoothness of Ovid\u2019s slyly shape-shifting \u201cMetamorphoses,\u201d the suggestive meanderings of Proust\u2019s sentences, the precocious adolescent grandiosity of \u201cThe Catcher in the Rye.\u201d The best translations find just the right way to convey even the unappealing qualities of the original. Richard Howard\u2019s 1999 rendering of Stendhal\u2019s \u201cCharterhouse of Parma\u201d went so far as to reproduce the grammatical errors in that hasty writer\u2019s prose: you  \n the novel was written in seven weeks.         \n\n \n. Tone is everything. A novel in which characters say \u201cI daresay\u201d is galaxies apart from one in which characters say \u201cI kinda think.\u201d Aeschylus\u2019 \u201cAgamemnon\u201d is notorious for its elaborate diction and inscrutable syntax \u2014 a murky Greek that nicely suggests the moral and political murkiness that is the play\u2019s subject. When David R. Slavitt chose to pepper his 1997 translation of this titanic masterpiece with phrases like \u201clearning curve,\u201d \u201cstress-related\u201d and \u201cWatch what you say, mister,\u201d he was not only cheapening the diction but hamstringing the play\u2019s larger meanings. Clytemnestra is  \n Joan Crawford.         \n\nThen again, \u201cWatch what you say, mister\u201d is great advice for all translators. Or in the words of Rilke \u2014 to elevate the tone a bit \u2014 \u201cWhat, if not this deep translation, is your ardent aim?\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\n\u25c6 \u25c6 \u25c6         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \nDana Stevens \n\nTranslating Homer \u2014 as Barry B. Powell has just done with the \u201cIliad\u201d and Stephen Mitchell with the \u201cOdyssey\u201d \u2014 is either an act of hubris worthy of Achilles himself or a gesture of great translatorly humility. To add one\u2019s own puny mortal voice to the generation-spanning chorus that has told and retold these stories is to join the longest transmission bloodline in Western literature.         \n\nEver since the oral epics were first set down in writing, they have been, in one way or another, undergoing a continual process of translation. Powell, a classics professor now retired from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, has made the controversial argument that the Greek alphabet was created (that is to say adapted, with important variations, from existing writing systems) by a single individual for the purpose of recording the poetry of Homer \u2014 which, if true, would make that primal act of transcription the  \n Homeric translation. Mitchell, a poet who has translated the verse of Rilke, the epic \u201cGilgamesh,\u201d the Bhagavad-Gita and, in 2011, an \u201cIliad\u201d of his own, holds a different view, aligning himself with scholars who maintain that the \u201cIliad\u201d and the \u201cOdyssey\u201d were composed by two separate poets who lived a generation or more apart.         \n\nHowever it was these campfire tales about the Trojan War and its aftermath came to be written, from the moment stylus hit papyrus it was open season for succeeding generations and cultures to reinterpret and reshape them as their own. The Greek tragedians made free use of Homeric themes and characters, elaborating on incidents suggested by but absent from the poems. Plato denounced the power that Homer\u2019s poetry held over the popular culture of the day. Around the time of Christ\u2019s birth, Virgil appropriated elements from both Homeric epics for the \u201cAeneid,\u201d a deliberate reboot of the form for Roman imperial culture. Fourteen centuries later, the Italian humanist scholars Petrarch and Boccaccio almost single-handedly rescued Homer from obscurity by obtaining manuscripts of the Homeric epics for their libraries \u2014 but neither poet could read Greek, so Boccaccio commissioned a bare-bones Latin translation that Petrarch, with endearing chutzpah, proceeded to critique.         \n\nThroughout Western history, to talk about Homer has been to talk about the process by which these ancient songs, their melodies lost, are transformed into documents with something to tell the living about war and grief and survival and homecoming. John Keats\u2019s ecstatic sonnet \u201cOn First Looking Into Chapman\u2019s Homer\u201d is as much an ode to the alchemy of translation as it is to the power of poetry. Keats seems to imply that he had never truly gotten the point of Homer\u2019s verse (\u201cYet did I never breathe its pure serene\u201d) until a friend passed him a copy of the vivid rhymed-couplet \u201cOdyssey\u201d translated by the Elizabethan playwright George Chapman. Matthew Arnold gave a series of lectures on the problems of Homeric translation in which he compared and assessed multiple English versions, from Chapman\u2019s to the 18th-century rendering by Alexander Pope, praised by Pope\u2019s contemporary Samuel Johnson as \u201ca performance which no age or nation can pretend to equal.\u201d Arnold named four qualities a good translation of Homer must hold in balance: his rapidity, his plainness and directness in both language and ideas, and his \u201cnobility.\u201d         \n\nIn their eagerness to make Homer accessible to impatient 21st-century ears, both new translations sometimes opt for speed and directness at the cost of nobility. In Powell\u2019s \u201cIliad,\u201d a displeased Achilles poutily informs Agamemnon, \u201cO.K., I\u2019m off to Phthia.\u201d Mitchell is also a believer in swiftness, eliminating many of the fixed epithets that give the Greek poem its stately rhythms, only occasionally allowing the dawn to show off her rosy fingers or Athena her flashing eyes. But Mitchell\u2019s fresh, elegant diction and the care he lavishes on meter \u2014 turning the original dactylic hexameter into an irregular five-beat rhythm inspired in part by the late poems of Wallace Stevens \u2014 brought me closer to the transfigurative experience Keats describes on reading Chapman\u2019s Homer: \u201cThen felt I like some watcher of the skies / When a new planet swims into his ken.\u201d         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/books/review/what-do-you-look-for-in-modern-translation.html", "date": "2013-10-08", "description": "Daniel Mendelsohn and Dana Stevens on the qualities any superior translation should contain."}
