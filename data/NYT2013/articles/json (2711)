{"headline": "Key Syrian Rebel Groups Abandon Exile Leaders", "body": "\nBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 As diplomats at the United Nations push for a peace conference to end Syria\u2019s civil war, a collection of some of the country\u2019s most powerful rebel groups have publicly abandoned the opposition\u2019s political leaders, casting their lot with an affiliate of Al Qaeda.         \n\nAs support for the Western-backed leadership has dwindled, a second, more extreme Al Qaeda group has carved out footholds across parts of Syria, frequently clashing with mainline rebels who accuse it of making the establishment of an Islamic state a priority over the fight to topple President Bashar al-Assad.         \n\nThe fractured nature of the opposition, the rising radical Islamist character of some rebel fighters, and the increasing complexity of Syria\u2019s battle lines have left the exile leadership with diminished clout inside the country and have raised the question of whether it could hold up its end of any agreement reached to end the war.         \n\nThe deep differences between many of those fighting in Syria and the political leaders who have represented the opposition abroad spilled into the open late Tuesday, when 11 rebel groups issued a statement declaring that the opposition could be represented only by people who have \u201clived their troubles and shared in what they have sacrificed.\u201d         \n\nDistancing themselves from the exile opposition\u2019s call for a democratic, civil government to replace Mr. Assad, they called on all military and civilian groups in Syria to \u201cunify in a clear Islamic frame.\u201d Those that signed the statement included three groups aligned with the Western-backed opposition\u2019s Supreme Military Council.         \n\nMohannad al-Najjar, an activist close to the leadership of one of the statement\u2019s most powerful signers, Al Tawhid Brigade, said the group intended to send a message of disapproval to an exile leadership it believes has accomplished little.         \n\n\u201cWe found it was time to announce publicly and clearly what we are after, which is Shariah law for the country and to convey a message to the opposition coalition that it has been three years and they have never done any good for the Syrian uprising and the people suffering inside,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe statement was issued just as Western nations are striving to raise the profile of the \u201cmoderate\u201d Syrian political opposition, which is led by Ahmad al-Jarba. The United States and its allies have been reluctant to fully align with and arm the rebels because their ranks are heavily populated by Islamists.         \n\nFrance has scheduled an event on Thursday on the sidelines of the annual session of the United Nations General Assembly at which Mr. Jarba is to speak along with foreign ministers who have backed him, including Secretary of State John Kerry.         \n\nThere was no immediate comment from Mr. Jarba, whose coalition is formally known as the National Coalition of Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces. Mr. Jarba canceled a news conference that had also been scheduled for Thursday.         \n\nA senior State Department official who accompanied Mr. Kerry to the United Nations meetings this week said the United States was still trying to strengthen Mr. Jarba\u2019s coalition and suggested that some of the factions that had broken with him included extremists.         \n\n\u201cWe, of course, have seen the reports of an announcement by some Islamist opposition groups of their formation of a new political alliance,\u201d the State Department official said.         \n\n\u201cAs we\u2019ve already said clearly before, we\u2019ve been long working toward unity among the opposition,\u201d the official added. \u201cBut we also have had extreme concerns about extremists.\u201d         \n\nAnother American official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was discussing internal deliberations, said the coalition had recently made \u201creal progress\u201d in broadening its base by including an array of Kurdish parties as well as members of local councils in \u201cliberated\u201d areas of northern and eastern Syria.         \n\nBut the official acknowledged that the coalition had more to do to build up its credibility inside the country, since its headquarters are in Turkey and not Syria.
