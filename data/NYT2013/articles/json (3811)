The skull had arrived by truck from Colorado two days earlier and had just been suspended above a plywood wall spray-painted black that had been hastily erected near the building\u2019s main entrance.         \n\n\u201cThis looks better than I thought it would,\u201d Mr. Kopelman said. He pointed to the spiky fangs and horns with their creepy decay and added, \u201cI didn\u2019t like the color, so I had my painter go back and add cracks and stuff.\u201d         \n\nMr. Kopelman is a professional haunted house producer and designer, or \u201chaunter\u201d in industry parlance. He opened his first haunted house 30 years ago in Phoenix, and promoted it by driving a huge Frankenstein head around in a truck, making sure it broke down on the city\u2019s busiest corner during rush hour. (\u201cI read P. T. Barnum\u2019s book,\u201d he said.) In recent years, he has designed or promoted multiple \u201chaunts\u201d across the country every Halloween season.         \n\nA genial, salt-and-pepper-haired man of 56 who lives in Houston, he isn\u2019t a big fan of horror films or Goth culture \u2014 or, for that matter, dressing up on Halloween. He sees haunted houses as a profitable business, and likes the theatricality. \u201cI always had the dream of producing movies,\u201d he said.         \n\nHe was at the Fairplex to oversee construction of  \n, a collaboration with the rock musician and horror-film director, based on the gory Rob Zombie oeuvre. The production, Mr. Kopelman said, is the biggest of his career: a $2 million budget; three haunted houses encompassing 33,000 square feet; a \u201cBloody Boulevard\u201d outdoors; and 150 employees, including three seamstresses and \u201ca guy that shoots you with CO \n as you go through.\u201d         \n\nGreat American Nightmare may be the best example yet of the upsizing of haunted houses over the last decade, in the vein of \u201cmega haunts\u201d like Netherworld in Atlanta and the Beast in Kansas City, Mo., which have elaborate sets and are staffed by actors and the prop and makeup artists who have found themselves out of work in a C.G.I.-dominated Hollywood.         \n\nThere are now more than a thousand such large-scale attractions around the country, said Larry Kirchner, editor of  \n, and haunting has become a sophisticated, $1 billion-a-year industry. Even the season itself has expanded: many haunted houses open in late September and extend past Halloween to early November. This year, the National Retail Federation\u2019s annual Halloween survey found that more than 31 million Americans plan to visit a haunted house, often paying from $15 to $30 each.         \n\nRay Kohout, who created one of the first large-scale, themed haunted houses in St. Louis in 1991, marveled at the evolution. \u201cNow there\u2019s animatronics and realistic props,\u201d said Mr. Kohout, who franchised his project, known as Silo X, to nine cities at its peak before getting out of the business 10 years ago. \u201cBack then, it was much more primitive and simplistic, a lot more about blood and guts.\u201d         \n\nFor Rob Zombie, who remembers the lame haunted rides at carnivals in his \u201970s youth, the goal is a Disney-like level of art direction. \u201cGoing into the Haunted Mansion as a kid, your jaw drops,\u201d he said. \u201cThe attention to detail at Disneyland is outrageous. That\u2019s what I want to be able to do here.\u201d         \n\nAs with his movies, however, he wants visitors to leave with a vague sense of revulsion. \u201cMy approach has been to create that weird, unnerving feeling that you can\u2019t shake,\u201d he said. \u201cI like to screw with your head.\u201d         \n\nTHE MOST COMMON TRICK haunted house designers employ is the startle scare: the man who jumps from behind a corner; the animatronic skeleton that drops from the ceiling, its jaw clattering; the sudden, bloodcurdling scream. Timothy Haskell, an owner and the creative director of  \n, a popular and long-running haunted house in Manhattan, said startles are necessary but \u201cephemeral.\u201d         \n\nA veteran theater director, Mr. Haskell writes a 20-page script every year and \u201cplays upon people\u2019s empathy,\u201d he said, to induce a more lasting bout of heebie-jeebies. Last year, for his serial-killer theme, he designed a set where visitors executed Ted Bundy. \u201cThey had to actually flip the switch,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd feel in their hands the electricity pulsing through.\u201d         \n\nBen Armstrong, of Netherworld, strives to incorporate new forms of technology, he said, which he often finds at the Halloween and Attractions Show, an industry trade show held every spring in St. Louis. Lately, he has been experimenting with projection effects. \u201cI found a particular material that you can see through, but it grabs light,\u201d Mr. Armstrong said. \u201cYou see the ghost, but you see past him to the background.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/24/garden/house-haunters.html", "date": "2013-10-23", "description": "For designers who specialize in haunted houses, it\u2019s high season.
