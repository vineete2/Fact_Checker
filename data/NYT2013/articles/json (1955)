{"headline": "Health Site\u2019s Woes Could Dissuade Vital Enrollee: the Young and Healthy", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Sean Jackson, like tens of thousands of other Americans, has had trouble signing up for medical coverage using the  \n insurance marketplace, despite several attempts.         \n\n\u201cI was able to create an account on Oct. 2, and I haven\u2019t been able to get into there since,\u201d said Mr. Jackson, a sports journalist living in Ohio, a note of annoyance in his voice. \u201cI\u2019ll try at random times, like late at night or early in the morning. I sign in. It just goes to a blank screen.\u201d         \n\nThe economists and policy wonks behind the Affordable Care Act worry that the technical problems bedeviling the federal portal could become much more than an inconvenience. If applicants like Mr. Jackson decide to put off or give up on buying coverage, rising prices and even a destabilized insurance market could result.         \n\nThe enrollment of people like Mr. Jackson, who is 32, is vital for the  \n \u2014 and, for that matter, the entire health care system \u2014 to work. Younger people, who tend to have very low anticipated medical costs, are supposed to help pay for the medical costs of older or sicker enrollees. Without them, so-called risk pools in Ohio and other states might become too risky, forcing insurers to raise premiums. Those higher premiums could dissuade more of the young and healthy from signing up, forcing insurers to raise prices again.         \n\nEconomists call the process \u201cadverse selection\u201d and warn that in its worst iteration it could lead to a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d of falling enrollment and climbing prices.         \n\nEconomists and health analysts said the chances of such a spiral were slim in most states because Americans who go without insurance would face penalties, starting next year. But they said that the endemic problems with the Web site posed a serious question about the enrollment balance in many state plans.         \n\n\u201cIf there are significantly more of the older and higher-cost people purchasing coverage than are expected, that\u2019s going to have a significant impact on premiums for the following year,\u201d said Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, a lobbying group for insurers covering 200 million Americans. He added, \u201cIt could ultimately destabilize the market.\u201d         \n\nThe young and healthy have always been seen as crucial to making the health law work, and the Obama administration and many state governments have focused on getting them to sign up.         \n\nFor the White House, that has meant using the demographic microtargeting techniques used during the 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns to identify and reach young people in the hope that they would make up about 40 percent of new enrollees in the health exchanges. For Colorado, it has meant creating an  \n showing \u201cbros\u201d drinking beer while celebrating insurance coverage. \u201cKeg stands are crazy,\u201d the ad reads. \u201cNot having  \n is crazier.\u201d         \n\nBut getting \u201cyoung invincibles,\u201d as insurers sometimes call them, to sign up for insurance is an uphill climb. Even with the public campaigns, only about one in four 19- to 29-year-olds is even aware of the exchanges where they might buy affordable insurance, and the ignorance is especially acute among the uninsured, according to a  \n this year by the Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit research group.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s very low awareness among young adults,\u201d said Sara R. Collins, an economist with the Commonwealth Fund. \u201cIt\u2019s a concern in states that aren\u2019t actively promoting these exchanges. People might remain unaware,\u201d she said, referring to the 36 states that have opted to let the federal government run their exchanges for them. They include Texas and Mississippi, where public officials are campaigning against the health law.         \n\nThat lack of awareness makes it all the more important that those who do know about  \n \u2014 and try to purchase insurance there \u2014 are not dissuaded because of the glitches, the analysts said. Older and sicker Americans have a stronger incentive to keep trying to sign up despite the clunky site, they said.         \n\nThough economists, insurers and health analysts are concerned about the problems with HealthCare.gov, which the Obama administration has promised to fix by Nov. 30, they said it was too early to tell whether the problems would cause an underenrollment of the young and healthy. \u00a0Insurers would have a good sense of any problems by next spring, they said.\u00a0         \n\nNo statistics are available on how many of them have signed up. States are providing no demographic details on enrollees. And the Obama administration has declined to say how many people have purchased insurance in the 36 states where it runs the exchanges.         \n\nJonathan Gruber, an economist with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who helped create the Affordable Care Act, said lessons could be drawn from Massachusetts, which in 2006 implemented a similar law to provide near-universal coverage in the state.         \n\nMany Massachusetts residents waited until just before the state law\u2019s tax penalty kicked in before signing up for insurance, he said. Just 123 people signed up for subsidized insurance in the first month of enrollment, and only about 2,000 in the second month.         \n\nMs. Collins, of the Commonwealth Fund, also said the federal requirement to buy insurance might compel the young and healthy to sign up. \u201cAs people learn about the provisions, and become aware of them, enrollment increases,\u201d she said. \u201cIt may be that healthy people procrastinate longer than unhealthy people.\u201d         \n\nGary Claxton, a policy expert with the Kaiser Family Foundation, noted that provisions in the law help ease the costs to insurers if the enrollment mix raises medical costs more than expected, so they might not increase premiums too sharply.         \n\n\u201cIf insurers are convinced the people that they\u2019ve enrolled are going to continue to be sicker than expected, premiums will go up,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if they believe people who didn\u2019t enroll in the first year will show up in the second, it might not have that big an impact on premiums.\u201d         \n\nFor now, the Obama administration is rushing to make signing up as smooth as possible to ensure that the young and healthy enroll. Mr. Jackson, of Ohio, intends to see his application through.         \n\n\u201cAt this point, I\u2019m just printing it out and sending it in,\u201d he said, referring to one of the offline options for signing up. \u201cI\u2019ll probably have it done by the end of the month.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/28/us/health-sites-woes-could-dissuade-vital-enrollee-the-young-and-healthy.html", "date": "2013-10-27", "description": "Officials worry that insurance risk pools could become too risky if not enough younger people sign up for coverage, causing premiums to escalate."}
