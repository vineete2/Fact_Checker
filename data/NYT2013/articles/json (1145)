{"headline": "Obama Commutes Sentences for 8 in Crack Cocaine Cases", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama, expanding his push to curtail severe penalties in drug cases, on Thursday  \n. Each inmate has been imprisoned for at least 15 years, and six were sentenced to life in prison.         \n\nIt was the first time retroactive relief was provided to a group of inmates who would most likely have received significantly shorter terms if they had been sentenced under current drug laws, sentencing rules and charging policies. Most will be released in 120 days. The commutations opened a major new front in the administration\u2019s efforts to curb soaring taxpayer spending on prisons and to help correct what it has portrayed as inequality in the justice system.         \n\nIn a  \n, Mr. Obama said that each of the eight men and women had been sentenced under what is now recognized as an \u201cunfair system,\u201d including a 100-to-1 sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine offenses that was significantly reduced by the  \n.         \n\n\u201cIf they had been sentenced under the current law, many of them would have already served their time and paid their debt to society,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cInstead, because of a disparity in the law that is now recognized as unjust, they remain in prison, separated from their families and their communities, at a cost of millions of taxpayer dollars each year.\u201d         \n\nThe commutations have come during a pendulum swing away from tough mandatory minimum sentencing laws enacted a generation ago amid the crack epidemic. The policies fueled an 800 percent increase in the number of prisoners in the United States. They also carried a racial charge: Offenses involving crack, which was disproportionately prevalent in impoverished black communities, carried far more severe penalties than those for powder cocaine, favored by affluent white users.         \n\nAccording to  \n, about  \n are serving time for crack offenses committed before Congress reduced mandatory minimum sentences, going forward, in the 2010 law.         \n\nThe commutation recipients included Clarence Aaron of Mobile, Ala., who was sentenced to three life terms in prison for his role in a 1993 drug deal, when he was 22. Mr. Aaron\u2019s case has been taken up by civil rights groups and congressional critics of severe sentencing for nonviolent drug offenses, and has received\u00a0 \n news  \n\u00a0 \n.         \n\nMargaret Love, his lawyer, said she received a call informing her of the decision on Thursday morning and called her client, who along with his family was \u201cvery grateful.\u201d         \n\n\u201cHe was absolutely overcome,\u201d Ms. Love said. \u201cActually, I was, too. He was in tears. This has been a long haul for him, 20 years. He just was speechless, and it\u2019s very exciting.\u201d         \n\nRights groups like the  \n, which had profiled several of the recipients in a recent  \n, greeted the announcement with praise and calls for additional efforts.         \n\nReaction among conservatives,  \n, was muted. The top Republicans on the House and Senate Judiciary Committees declined to comment.         \n\nThe commutation recipients also included Reynolds Wintersmith, of Rockford, Ill., who was 17 in 1994 when he was sentenced to life in prison for dealing crack, and Stephanie George, of Pensacola, Fla., who  \n in 1997, when she was 27, for hiding a boyfriend\u2019s stash of crack in a box in her house. In both cases, the judges criticized the mandatory sentences they were required to impose, calling them unjust.         \n\nIn December 2012, The New York Times published an  \n about Ms. George\u2019s case and the larger rethinking of the social and economic costs of long prison terms for nonviolent offenders. Mr. Obama mentioned the article in  \n that day and said he was considering asking officials about ways to do things \u201csmarter.\u201d         \n\nAround that time, a senior White House official said, Mr. Obama directed Kathryn Ruemmler, his White House counsel, to ask the Justice Department to examine pending clemency petitions to assess whether there were any in which current inmates serving long sentences would have benefited from subsequent changes to sentencing laws and policy.         \n\nThe deputy attorney general, James M. Cole, who oversees the pardon office, worked on the policy shift and ultimately returned the eight cases with positive recommendations from the department, the official said.         \n\nIn 2010, there was bipartisan support in Congress for reducing the disparity in sentences between crack and powder cocaine, against a backdrop of crime rates that have plunged to the lowest levels in four decades. And in August, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr.  \n to omit listing any quantities of illicit substances in indictments for low-level drug offenses in order to avoid triggering mandatory minimum sentences.         \n\nBut those moves have left unanswered what, if anything, to do about federal inmates serving lengthy sentences for crack offenses committed before the Fair Sentencing Act.         \n\n \n co-sponsored by Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, and Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, would make the Fair Sentencing Act retroactive for some offenders, allowing inmates to apply to a judge for a review of whether a reduced sentence would be appropriate.         \n\nThe Obama administration supports that bill, the White House said on Thursday, as an orderly way to ensure case-by-case analysis in addressing the broader problem.         \n\n\u201cIn the new year, lawmakers should act on the kinds of bipartisan sentencing reform measures already working their way through Congress,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cTogether, we must ensure that our taxpayer dollars are spent wisely, and that our justice system keeps its basic promise of equal treatment for all.\u201d         \n\nMr. Obama, who has made  \n, also pardoned 13 people who completed their sentences long ago. Those cases involved mostly minor offenses, in line with his previous pardons.
