{"headline": "Time Reveals Lower Death Toll From Oklahoma Tornado", "body": "\nMOORE, Okla. \u2014 At the end of the day on Monday, on the last week of the school year, students at Plaza Towers Elementary in this blue-collar suburb were zipping their backpacks. A fifth-grade class had just finished watching a movie about a boy who survives a crash-landing in the Canadian wilderness.         \n\nThen the sirens started to wail.         \n\nClaire Gossett\u2019s teacher hurried the class into the hallway, then into a bathroom as a tornado that was more than a mile wide drew closer. Claire, 11, crammed into a stall with six other girls. They held onto each other. The sirens wailed two, three, four times.         \n\nEcho Mackey, crouched in a hallway with her son, Logan, recalled, \u201cI heard someone say, \u2018It\u2019s about to hit us,\u2019 and then the power went out.\u201d         \n\nThe mountain of rubble that was once Plaza Towers Elementary School has become the emotional and physical focal point of one of the most destructive tornadoes to strike Oklahoma. Although the casualty toll fluctuated wildly early on, officials said on Tuesday that at least 24 people had died, including 9 children, 7 of them at Plaza Towers.         \n\nThroughout the 500-student school, teachers and parents had shielded students and crammed into closets and anywhere else they could squeeze as the tornado bore down. Then school windows were smashed and the ceiling ripped away, showering the students with glass, wood and pieces of insulation. \u201cI couldn\u2019t hear anything but people screaming and crying,\u201d Claire said. \u201cIt felt like the school was just flying.\u201d         \n\nThe tornado swirled out of a fast-developing storm that began cutting a destructive path through Moore and other sections of the southern Oklahoma City suburbs on Monday about 2:45 p.m. It plowed through 17 miles of ground over 50 minutes, damaging or destroying hundreds of homes, businesses, schools and hospitals in Moore and in Oklahoma City itself. Winds reached speeds of up to 210 miles per hour, and many structures were wiped clean to their foundations.         \n\nSevere weather has become an almost routine part of life in Oklahoma City and its suburbs, a section of Middle America where the lore of twisters and thunderstorms has long been embraced and at times even celebrated. The National Basketball Association team is called the Thunder, and there is an annual National Weather Festival, where families gather for weather balloon launchings and storm-chaser car shows. But the 1.3-mile-wide tornado that struck Plaza Towers on Monday stunned Oklahomans, in both its size and the number of victims, dozens of whom were students who were killed or injured.         \n\nAt a news conference on Tuesday in the lobby of Moore City Hall, which was running on generators because of a widespread power failure, Gov. Mary Fallin said she took an aerial tour of the tornado\u2019s path and inspected the damage by car and on foot. She said she was left speechless. \u201cThere\u2019s just sticks and bricks, basically,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cIt was very surreal coming upon the school because there was no school. There was just debris.\u201d         \n\nOfficials said it was still too early to say precisely how many people had been killed, but the toll appeared to be significantly less than initially feared. State officials lowered the death toll to at least 24, down from their estimate late Monday night of nearly 100 fatalities. One reason for the uncertainty was that officials believed that some bodies might have been taken to local funeral homes instead of the state medical examiner\u2019s office, which was doing the official count. But it appeared that the 48 people who were believed to be missing on Monday night \u2014 and were feared dead \u2014 had been found. More than 200 were injured, including 70 children.         \n\nThe confusion only added to the unease. As officials spoke at City Hall, heavy rain and booms of thunder could be heard, severe weather that had periodically delayed rescuers and those assessing the damage throughout the day.
