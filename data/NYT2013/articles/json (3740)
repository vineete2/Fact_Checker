{"headline": "Week 1 in Fantasy Football: Matchup Breakdown", "body": "\nUpward  \nand many of them will be participating in the first week of the fantasy football season. There are  \n these days, and we are honored that you chose us to help you prepare for Week 1.         \n\nFor those who are unfamiliar with this column, each week we will highlight some players who are not automatic fantasy starts who have a chance to perform well based on their matchups for the week. You do not need us to know that Peyton Manning or Adrian Peterson should be in your starting lineup. But you may benefit from learning about those who are not in the elite tier of fantasy players.         \n\nThe players featured in these posts will coincide with  \n and will help explain why certain players are ranked where they are.         \n\nSince we cannot say for sure how this season\u2019s defenses will fare, the first few weeks are always the toughest to measure. We can only assume some of last year\u2019s units will perform in a similar fashion when considering their preseason performances and off-season moves.         \n\nWe will also be taking your lineup questions all season on Twitter.  \n and best of luck this season!         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \nA Redskins secondary that ranked third worst in the league against the pass in 2012 returns as basically the same unit in 2013, outside of safety Madieu Williams. It will be tested early by the new fast-paced attack of Chip Kelly\u2019s Eagles, an offense that Vick, in the preseason, has looked like a natural fit to run \n         \n\n \nRomo torched the Giants\u2019 secondary for 307 yards and 3 TDs in last season\u2019s opener, and totaled 437 yards and a score in their second meeting. While the Giants\u2019 run defense looked much improved this preseason (2.9 yards per carry, tied for lowest in the league), their secondary remains a weakness and something opposing teams should continue to exploit.         \n\n \nStafford holds a 25.6-point fantasy average in his last three starts against the Vikings, and that was before he had the luxury of one of the best pass-catching backs in the league (Reggie Bush) lining up behind him.         \n\n \nThe Titans allowed 20 fantasy points a game to the position last season (ninth most) and Roethlisberger nearly hit that mark during his Week 7 outing against them in 2012, racking up 363 yards and a score. With the Steelers\u2019 running game left reeling after the LeVeon Bell injury, they are likely to lean on Roethlisberger\u2019s arm more until his return, and that could be trouble for the struggling Titans cornerbacks Alterraun Verner and Tommie Campbell.         \n\n \n         \n\n \nIn his two meetings with last season\u2019s 31st ranked run defense, Ridley tallied 204 yards and 3 touchdowns. He carried the ball exactly 22 times in each contest, and should have no problems reaching the 20-plus mark again in Week 1, as the Patriots are expected to lean on the run even more this season.         \n\n \nJackson will make his official Falcons debut this weekend against 2012\u2019s most favorable fantasy running back matchup (23 FPPG). The Saints\u2019 new 3-4 defense has looked surprisingly solid against vanilla offensive schemes this preseason (3.5 YPC), but it will be kicking off the new season under less than ideal circumstances, with summer injuries to the starting linebackers Victor Butler and Will Smith, as well as the main backups Junior Galette and Martez Wilson. The Saints\u2019 best linebacker, Jonathan Vilma, is also not likely to play in the opener.         \n\n \nM.J.D. showed no ill effects over the summer from the Lisfranc surgery eight months ago, and has a great chance to put up top 10 RB numbers this weekend against a Chiefs defense that allowed 19 fantasy points a game on the ground in 2012 (eighth most).         \n\n \nIn Gore\u2019s two run-ins with the Packers last season, he exploited them for almost 6 yards per carry; 112 rushing yards and a score in Week 1, and 119 yards and a TD during an encounter in the playoffs.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n The Eagles\u2019 secondary allowed the sixth most fantasy points to opposing wideouts last season, including a league-high 23 touchdowns to the position. Nnamdi Asomugha and Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie have been replaced by Bradley Fletcher and Cary Williams, but both players have had a hard time staying on the field this summer.         \n\n \nA Titans pass defense that struggled in 2012 (seventh worst in N.F.L.) is still trying to decide on a starting right cornerback (Alterraun Verner or Tommie Campbell). Neither player performed well enough in the preseason to claim the role.         \n\n \nHilton was one of the hottest receivers this preseason, racking up 7 receptions, 114 receiving yards and 3 TDs despite being a WR3 in the Colts\u2019 offense. He is a solid WR3 fantasy choice as well this week against a suspect Raiders secondary featuring a shaky Tracy Porter and the rookie D.J. Hayden, who was cleared for contact less than three weeks ago.
