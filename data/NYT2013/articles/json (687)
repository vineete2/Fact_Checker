{"headline": "Rules for Reverse Mortgages May Become More Restrictive", "body": "\nMany baby boomers will need to consider how their homes \u2014 and the value locked inside \u2014 will help finance their retirement years. Reverse mortgages, which essentially allow people to use their home as an A.T.M., could become an integral part of many retirees\u2019 financial plans, especially those who are short on cash but do not want to move.         \n\nRight now, practically anyone who is breathing can  \n \u2014 no underwriting or credit scores necessary. But that might be about to change.         \n\nMost reverse mortgages, which allow homeowners 62 and older to tap their home equity, are made through the \n, whose Federal Housing Administration arm insures the loans. But declining home prices after the housing crisis took a big toll on the federal program. So did the popularity of one type of mortgage, which allowed homeowners to withdraw the maximum amount of money available in a big lump sum.         \n\nThe F.H.A. eliminated that type of loan this year. And over the last few years, in an effort to strengthen the program, the agency raised its fees and reduced the amounts people could borrow.         \n\nBut now, the F.H.A. says it will need to take even bigger steps by the beginning of its new fiscal year in October.         \n\nBecause of the turmoil in the housing market and because many borrowers in the program didn\u2019t have enough money to pay their property taxes and homeowners insurance over the long term, the F.H.A. wants to require borrowers to undergo a financial assessment. It may also factor in borrowers\u2019 credit scores, something it has not done in the past.         \n\nBefore the agency can do either, it needs Congressional approval. The House \n last month, but it\u2019s unclear whether the Senate will follow suit.         \n\nIf the F.H.A. fails to get Congress\u2019s blessing, it will have to take more draconian actions in the coming months, according to F.H.A. officials who did not want to be named because they were still working with Congress on the issue. That means that effective Oct. 1, yet another of its  \n will probably be eliminated, leaving borrowers with options that would allow them to get access to 10 to 15 percent less cash than they can now.         \n\n\u201cInstead of using a scalpel, they will have to use a hatchet,\u201d said Christopher J. Mayer, professor of real estate, finance and economics at Columbia Business School, who is also a partner in a start-up company, Longbridge Financial, that provides reverse mortgages.         \n\nBorrowers who are now contemplating what is called a HECM (pronounced HECK-um) Standard (for home equity conversion mortgage) reverse mortgage should know that it could disappear in the fall. (Of course, that doesn\u2019t mean borrowers should rush out and get one. We will probably know the fate of the loan sometime next month.)         \n\nWith all reverse mortgages, the amount of cash you can obtain largely depends on the age of the youngest borrower, the home value and the prevailing interest rate. The older you are, the higher your home\u2019s value and the lower the interest rate, the more money you can withdraw. You don\u2019t have to make payments, but the interest is tacked onto the balance of the loan, which grows over time. When borrowers are ready to sell (or when they die), the bank takes its share of the proceeds from the sale, and borrowers or their heirs receive whatever is left, if anything.         \n\nRight now, using a \u201cstandard\u201d reverse mortgage, a 65-year-old borrower with a home worth $400,000 could tap about $226,800 in cash or a line of credit after various fees, according to calculations by ReverseVision Inc., a reverse mortgage software company.         \n\nBorrowers can receive the money in several other ways, too, including payments over the life of the loan or in installments in higher amounts over a specific term.         \n\nIf the F.H.A. were to eliminate the standard mortgage, the same borrower could instead use the \u201csaver\u201d reverse mortgage, which has lower fees but permits you to withdraw less: this homeowner could withdraw about $194,800, or 14 percent less than the \u201cstandard,\u201d in cash or a line of credit, after all fees. (Another \u201csaver\u201d option would also be available; see the chart accompanying this article for more specifics).         \n\nF.H.A. officials told me that they would prefer to keep all of the agency\u2019s mortgage offerings and instead put rules into place that would help ensure that they accept only borrowers who can actually afford to pay their property taxes and homeowners insurance, which is required to avoid foreclosure. Nearly 10 percent of reverse mortgage borrowers are in default because they failed to make those payments.
