{"headline": "Twitter Speaks, Markets Listen and Fears Rise", "body": "\nCould the global economy hinge on 140 characters?         \n\nThat is the question the financial industry and government regulators are trying to answer  \n that claimed President Obama was injured in an explosion at the White House. That report caused the Dow Jones industrial average to drop temporarily by 150 points, erasing $136 billion in market value.         \n\nThe markets recovered in minutes, but the episode has heightened concern among regulators about the combination of social media and  \n.         \n\nThe vulnerability, in part, stems from the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s decision this month  \n like Twitter and Facebook to broadcast market-moving news.         \n\nHigh-frequency trading systems are designed to make trades based on keywords within milliseconds. The hoax message also went out on a new feature on Bloomberg\u2019s financial data terminals that delivers select Twitter posts to hedge funds, investment banks and other users.         \n\nOn Tuesday, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission plans to hold a public meeting in Washington with a couple of dozen high-frequency traders to discuss whether there should be additional safeguards to protect against the effects of social media on markets.         \n\nEven as markets rebounded on Tuesday, some investors lost money on the quick decline while others made money if they bet on a sharp drop.         \n\n\u201cIn 2010, we passed Dodd-Frank, the big financial reform bill, but nowhere in there do they mention high-speed trading or technology,\u201d said Bart Chilton, a member of the trading commission. \u201cThat\u2019s how quickly markets are morphing. Now, here we are three years later, woefully unprepared.\u201d         \n\nThe false report (\u201cBreaking: Two Explosions in the White House and Barack Obama is injured\u201d) was posted on Tuesday after Syrian hackers broke into The Associated Press\u2019s Twitter feed.         \n\nImmediately, the mood shifted on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.         \n\n\u201cIt was nine, 10, 11 seconds and it was fast and then the question was \u2018Why\u2019?\u201d said Andrew Frankel, co-president of the brokerage firm Stuart Frankel & Company.         \n\nHe said traders realized shortly after that the post was a hoax since the television screens showing Bloomberg and CNBC had nothing about an explosion at the White House. Still, the episode recalled the 2010 \u201cflash crash,\u201d when an automated trading program caused the Dow to sink more than 600 points, and it left a deep skepticism of social media on the trading floor.         \n\n\u201cYou look at how quickly that happened and now everyone wants to release corporate earnings on Twitter,\u201d Mr. Frankel said, in between calling out, \u201cSell!\u201d to his team. He added: \u201cThe concern is \u2018How do you know what\u2019s right and what\u2019s not? How do you know what\u2019s hacked and what isn\u2019t?\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nSpokesmen for Twitter and The A.P. declined to comment.         \n\nEven though Syrian hackers remain the prime suspects, the trading commission is now investigating 28 different futures contracts and specifically examining the five-minute period before and after The A.P.\u2019s Twitter account was hacked. It is looking to see if there were anomalous trades, and investors who benefited from them.         \n\n\u201cTo think it was all lost because of this hack attack is very disconcerting,\u201d Mr. Chilton of the commission said. \u201cWe would be irresponsible if we turned a blind eye to these debacles.\u201d         \n\nThe decision to allow market information on social media came after Reed Hastings, chief executive of Netflix, had  \n that the service had exceeded one billion hours of streamed video a month, sending its stock price up.         \n\n\u201cWe appreciate the value and prevalence of social media channels in contemporary market communications, and the commission supports companies seeking new ways to communicate,\u201d the S.E.C. said on April 2.         \n\nTwo days later, Bloomberg introduced a feature on its financial data terminals that incorporates a stream of relevant Twitter posts delivered to investors. All of Bloomberg\u2019s more than 310,000 subscribers, who pay at least $20,000 a year for access to the terminals, now have access to those posts, which the company says are clearly identified as Twitter messages.         \n\n\u201cThe S.E.C.\u2019s decision reflects the reality that we were dealing with in that this information is being distributed by companies and investors are consuming it and we needed to get it on the terminal,\u201d said Brian Rooney, the company\u2019s core product manager for news, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re not in a world where people live in a vacuum.\u201d         \n\nAt the same time, the use of algorithms designed to peruse millions of sources of information like blogs and social media to analyze and execute trades is only becoming more widespread.
