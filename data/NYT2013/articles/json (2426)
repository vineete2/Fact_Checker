{"headline": "Trying Unlikely Comeback, Ex-Iran President Strikes Chord With Public", "body": "\nTEHRAN \u2014 There was a time when Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani seemed to have it all. A founder of the Islamic Revolution, he headed a family empire that owned the second biggest Iranian airline, Mahan, had a near monopoly on the lucrative pistachio trade and controlled the country\u2019s largest private university, Azad.         \n\nBut then things started to go wrong. Iranians, angered by his wealth, back-room dealings and supposed involvement in the killing of dissidents, nicknamed him \u201cAkbar Shah,\u201d after the old Persian rulers who sat on velvet cushions in lush courtyards. Political rivals, jealous of his grip on the economy, seized on his support for reformists and labeled him an \u201caristocrat,\u201d a \u201ccapitalist\u201d and a supporter of \u201cAmerican Islam\u201d         \n\nHis political stock fell so low that in 2002 he could not even muster the votes to win a seat in Parliament. He suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the 2005 presidential election, and two of his children ended up in jail. His speech in favor of greater freedom during the 2009 protests alienated him from Iran\u2019s conservative clerics and military commanders.         \n\nNow, from the fringes of Iran\u2019s closed circle of power, Mr. Rafsanjani, 79, is attempting a comeback, entering his name last Saturday for the June 14 presidential elections. Though once widely reviled, his reputation as an economic pragmatist and modernizer \u2014 by Iranian standards, anyway \u2014 seems to be hitting a responsive chord with the public.         \n\n\u201cHe is the only one that can fix this mess,\u201d said Farshad Ghorbanpour, a journalist who spent several months in jail for his ties to the opposition. \u201cThis man is an icon of our revolution. He owns the shop, so to speak. He will fix the economy.\u201d         \n\nTired of Iran\u2019s stumbling economy and galloping inflation rate, most Iranians yearn for policies that stimulate business while lowering the prices of staples, real estate and foreign exchange. While generally fed up with politics, many in Tehran say that Mr. Rafsanjani, whose policies as president formed the basis for Iran\u2019s modern day middle class, is the man for the job.         \n\n\u201cHe is a master of economy, and at the moment my business is doing really bad,\u201d said Hasan Sarhangi, 35, a trader from the poorer southern part of Tehran. \u201cWe have no one with his qualities. He can make us rich again.\u201d         \n\nIf approved as a candidate \u2014 and that is by no means assured \u2014 Mr. Rafsanjani is likely to find himself walking a tightrope, trying to address his natural constituency of dissatisfied urban Iranians who want more freedoms and realistic economic policies while not further alienating the country\u2019s leaders, many of whom say he should be tried for corruption and links to the opposition.         \n\nA close associate of the Islamic republic\u2019s founder, Ayatollah Khomeini, and president from 1989 to 1997, Mr. Rafsanjani was once the nation\u2019s kingmaker, said to have brought the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to power after Ayatollah Khomeini\u2019s death. It is only that pedigree, most analysts agree, as well as Ayatollah Khamenei\u2019s continuing support, that has allowed him to survive his fall and even hope to fight his way back into power.         \n\nAnd even then, the road back is bound to be treacherous. Iran\u2019s intelligence minister, Heydar Moslehi, an appointee of Ayatollah Khamenei\u2019s, recently warned Mr. Rafsanjani not to become a candidate. The only reasons Mr. Rafsanjani was not under house arrest for his speech in 2009, the minister said, were \u201ccertain considerations by the system,\u201d meaning his relationship with the supreme leader.         \n\n\u201cDo not make the mistake to think the role you have played is forgotten by the revolution,\u201d said Mr. Moslehi, referring to the 2009 protests.         \n\nAnother hurdle is whether the Guardian Council, an evaluating body whose 12 members are appointed by Ayatollah Khamenei, as well as the head of the judiciary, and confirmed by Parliament, will even allow Mr. Rafsanjani to participate in the elections.
