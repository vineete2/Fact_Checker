{"headline": "In the Village, an Intersection of Paint and Quaint", "body": "\nNo village street better illustrates how the artists\u2019 studio movement of the 1910s swamped the original private house character of the Village than Waverly Place between Sixth Avenue and Washington Square West. An immaculate row of prim 1840s brick houses on the north side coolly faces down the insouciantly picturesque artists\u2019 studios on the south. Both, as it turns out, are in short supply.         \n\nIn the mid-19th century, this block of Waverly Place played a mild second fiddle to the certifiably grand houses of Washington Square. Nos. 107 to No. 111, a nearly pristine series of brick houses, survive.         \n\nNo. 107 has remarkable Greek Revival ironwork. That was the house of  \n, a Boston-born merchant and importer. In 1854, he and his wife and daughter Mary, who had just finished her studies abroad, went down with the steamer  \n when it sank after being rammed by another ship.         \n\nThe elite began leaving the neighborhood within a few decades, most before 1891, when an apartment house invaded what were once sacred precincts. This was the modest Cecilia at 116 Waverly.         \n\nAround 1900, artists including the Ashcan School painter Everett Shinn began flocking to the cheap rents and quaint character of the village. Shinn moved into 112 Waverly and made the rear courtyard into a playhouse where he designed sets and put on performances.         \n\nVincent Pepe smelled the turpentine on the wind and began fixing up run-down houses for this new kind of tenant, remaking them with Mediterranean-style facades. Among them was the old Greek Revival house at 124 Waverly, inhabited by an artificial-limb maker and a chauffeur, not the types to respond to the emerging charms of the city\u2019s Latin Quarter.         \n\nPepe evicted them so he could redo the place to suit artists. But prospective tenants \u2014 including the sculptor  \n, who took the top-floor studio and would go on to do the statue of Thomas Jefferson at the Jefferson Memorial \u2014 complained about the loss of the original architectural features.         \n\nPepe relented and in 1917 expressed surprise to The Real Estate Record and Guide: \u201cIt seems that the mahogany doors, with silver knobs and old marble mantels and columns, possess particular charm.\u201d In the end, he gave No. 124 a simple stucco front but left its Greek Revival door surround.         \n\nFor Pepe, there was certainly charm in running the numbers \u2014 after the renovation, the rent roll at No. 124 rose to $4,700 from $1,000 per year.         \n\nThis chapter of Village history is deftly captured by  \n in his 2009 book \u201cThe Row House Reborn.\u201d         \n\nThe income level bounced up a few notches with the arrival of the society portrait painter Murray Percival Bewley. In 1920, around the time The New York Sun wrote that Bewley \u201cpaints cleverly, perhaps too cleverly,\u201d he bought the old brick house at 114 Waverly Place, retaining the little-known William Sanger to turn it into one of the most memorable residences in New York \u2014 not solely because it has been painted salmon-pink for decades.         \n\nSanger gave his client a sumptuous Mediterranean facade, with wide arched window openings, broad French windows and, at the top, a strange arcade of mini-windows below a striking half-oval studio window.         \n\nBy 1940 almost all the old private houses had been converted to apartments and studios; the census of that year found the actor Joseph Cotten, just beginning the film \u201cCitizen Kane\u201d with his friend Orson Welles, in an apartment at No. 122.         \n\nChange has again overtaken Waverly Place. Everett Shinn\u2019s old house, No. 112, has been immaculately renovated with honey-colored French windows and now bears a plaque declaring it the \u201cRichard Easton Carriage House,\u201d even though there is not the slightest trace of a carriage entrance. (Mr. Easton worked on Wall Street, but cashed out and created what his Web site describes as \u201cthe world\u2019s most exclusive dating club.\u201d)         \n\nCotten would gasp at his old building, No. 122, fixed up within an inch of its life, with frosted glass windows, impeccably cleaned brick and top-drawer replacement windows. Building records indicate it was renovated half a dozen years ago by Gerald Rosenfeld, the former head of investment banking at Lazard Fr\u00e8res. It is now for sale for $18.9 million.         \n\nAcross the street the sober Federal-style houses have been polished like a pair of cavalry boots from John Lobb; the black-painted front door of 111 is as flawless.         \n\nOn the south side, next to the Bewley house, is an astonishing project: Spruce 116 Waverly L.L.C., for which the principal is not identified, has taken the bedraggled old Cecilia, a near-tenement, and converted it into a private house. This indicates that the stock of private houses eligible for restoration has just about been exhausted, and supports the maxim of the Stribling broker Kirk Henckels that the New York market is so hot, \u201cthere\u2019s simply a shortage of unaffordable housing.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/30/realestate/in-the-village-an-intersection-of-paint-and-quaint.html", "date": "2013-06-27", "description": "Waverly Place between Sixth Avenue and Washington Square West has been remodeled quite a bit since its days as a polite address."}
