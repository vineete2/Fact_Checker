{"headline": "Young Catcher Can Help Tell Ending to Rivera\u2019s Story", "body": "\nThe young man who caught Mariano Rivera\u2019s final pitches at Yankee Stadium was born the year after Rivera made his debut in the minor leagues. John Ryan Murphy, known as J. R., No. 66 in your Yankees program, grew up a Red Sox fan in Bradenton, Fla., though he came of rooting age when the Yankees and Rivera owned major league baseball.         \n\n\u201cAs long as I\u2019ve ever been alive, or at least a baseball fan, Mariano\u2019s been the closer,\u201d Murphy said late Thursday night after participating in what to a 22-year-old September call-up felt like a grand reality show, \u201cCatching With the Stars.\u201d \u201cBeing part of this is something I\u2019ll never forget, something I\u2019ll be able to tell my kids I was a part of.\u201d         \n\nIt was a memorable night for baseball fans of all ages, high drama both staged and improvised, the Bronx as Broadway. But to Murphy\u2019s point about already looking forward to sharing Rivera\u2019s Stadium farewell with children he envisions having \u2014 wasn\u2019t that the true gift of Rivera, a man who year after year produced moments we could all learn something from and pass on?         \n\nHe made an emotional mess out of his normally rigidly composed manager, Joe Girardi, who was already sympathizing with the poor schlub who will succeed Rivera as the closer next season.         \n\n\u201cEvery time something goes wrong, they\u2019re going to say, \u2018That wouldn\u2019t have happened with Mo,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Girardi said. \u201cBut, you know, it did happen to Mo.\u201d         \n\nYes, Rivera wasn\u2019t perfect, but he was always poised, creating the sense of always having it all in perspective. From the man who saved so many games, we knew by following his greatest failures \u2014 not that there were all that many \u2014 that he truly understood it was just a game.         \n\nI have my own permanently engraved memory of Rivera making a bad throw to second base, surrendering a one-run lead and losing to the Arizona Diamondbacks in the ninth inning of Game 7 of the 2001 World Series. In the context of baseball intersecting with real life, this was probably the most important game of Rivera\u2019s career, as a post-9/11 run for a brutally scarred city came up tantalizingly short.         \n\nAn 11-year-old boy nestled next to me on the couch was sent to bed that Sunday night in utter disbelief. Mariano blew it? How could that be? Yes, but try to remember how he dealt with failure \u2014 throwing no tantrums, pointing no fingers. It happened. Move on. There will be another chance to do better.         \n\nThat boy, now about the same age as J. R. Murphy, had a seat in the right-field grandstand Thursday night. He, too, grew up knowing only Rivera as the greatest ninth-inning insurance policy in baseball history and he bought the ticket months ago with the anticipation that something special would happen when it was finally time to say goodbye.         \n\nAnd still it was hard to fathom the time had come.         \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe he\u2019s not going to be there anymore,\u201d he said early Friday morning on the way out the door to work.         \n\nAt his dressing stall, Murphy expressed similar sentiment \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s going to be strange next season\u201d \u2014 while sounding a little disbelieving of the whole experience at about the time Rivera was settling in with his family to address the news media in the interview room.         \n\nHad he been nervous when he saw his name in the lineup card?         \n\n\u201cNervous? No,\u201d he said. \u201cAnxious, yes.\u201d         \n\nThe game was  \n, as they were swept by the Tampa Bay Rays on their way to Houston for the hometown finale appearance of Andy Pettitte. Rivera registered his first career save for Pettitte and might well get his last for him Saturday. But the end we shall choose to remember began to unfold Thursday night when Girardi summoned Rivera with one out and two on in the eighth inning.         \n\nMurphy waited with the manager at the mound, an extra suddenly cast in a lead supporting role.         \n\n\u201cIt was the loudest it\u2019s ever been since I\u2019ve been around a baseball field,\u201d he said, while conceding that Rivera\u2019s entrance to get four straight outs was only an appetizer for the main event, his exit.         \n\nGirardi had asked the umpiring crew chief, Mike Winters, for permission to send out Pettitte and Derek Jeter to pull their longtime teammate. Teammates converged on the mound. With his mask pushed up on his head, Murphy was an unfamiliar fresh face, the young Moonlight Graham joining the grizzled ghosts on Ray Kinsella\u2019s Iowa Field of Dreams.         \n\nRivera hugged Pettitte and heaved in tears. Murphy stayed back, knowing his place.         \n\n\u201cI think we all just wanted to give them their space,\u201d he said. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t hear anything they were saying because the crowd was so loud but you could see right away how emotional it was. I was trying to hold it together myself. I mean, I\u2019m 22 years old and I\u2019ve been here for a month.\u201d         \n\nHowever long he lasts, he will be tethered to Rivera in highlights that will be replayed for generations with all the others on the big screen in center field. J. R. Murphy caught Mariano Rivera\u2019s last pitches at Yankee Stadium. His one regret was that it wasn\u2019t for the last out and a save.         \n\nGirardi, conversely, wasn\u2019t so sure what would have happened had the Yankees been winning, if he could have resisted sending out Jeter and Pettitte. These are the Yankees, after all, long famous for finishing with a flourish. And for what feels like forever \u2014 but officially for the last 17 years \u2014 with the grace and greatness of Mariano Rivera.
