{"headline": "Finding Inner Peace With the Angriest Punk of \u201970s New York", "body": "\n\u201cWe\u2019ve suffered enough as human beings and as women,\u201d Lydia Lunch said one bright morning in Ojai, Calif., as she gazed beneficently around her. Sixteen women, most of them middle-aged, had gathered at Ananda Verandah (\u201cAnanda\u201d is Sanskrit for \u201cbliss\u201d) to take Lunch\u2019s Post-Catastrophe Collaborative workshop.         \n\nAt 54, Lunch combines the louche air of an Italian starlet with the authority of a den mother. She has alabaster skin and voluptuous curves and wears her hair in a strategically choppy cut. Some might find it difficult to reconcile the Lunch smiling at her assembled guests with the Lunch whom many of her fans remember best \u2014 the self-styled nihilist and lead singer of Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, a seminal \u201970s No Wave band whose songs featured lyrics like \u201cLittle orphans running through the bloody snow.\u201d She lived in a loft in downtown New York with a sign in the window that read, \u201cThe Home for Teenage Dirt,\u201d and later performed in the sexually transgressive films of her friend Richard Kern. \u201cShe was famous,\u201d says the writer and D.J. Jim (The Hound) Marshall, \u201cas the first person everybody slept with when they got to New York.\u201d (\u201cDo you know how many teenage boys thanked me?\u201d Lunch says.)         \n\nBut Lunch insists that her second act as a women\u2019s empowerment coach makes perfect sense: \u201cI\u2019m the No Wave Anthony Robbins,\u201d she says. \u201cMy goal has always been to punch my way out of the trauma zone into the light.\u201d During the three-day seminar, participants meditated, chanted and threw negative memories into a campfire. There were hugs, shoulder rubs and skinny-dipping. \u201cAnyone who asks why we need a workshop for only women in 2013,\u201d Lunch told me, \u201cdoesn\u2019t realize the effect the patriarchy has had on our psyches.\u201d         \n\nBorn Lydia Anne Koch, Lunch grew up in Rochester, the second of four children. Her mother was a housewife, and her father sold vacuum cleaners. By age 13, Lunch had begun to rebel. Greg Prevost, a musician who worked at a record store in Rochester where Lunch and her friends hung out, remembers her as \u201ckind of like Alex in \u2018A Clockwork Orange,\u2019 only with glammed-up chicks.\u201d By 10th grade, she\u2019d dropped out, moved to Lower Manhattan and begun performing.         \n\nHer shows with Teenage Jesus were abrasive and pioneering. Sets rarely lasted longer than 15 minutes. \u201cA good show for Teenage Jesus would be they\u2019d clear the place out,\u201d says David Godlis, who photographed their first appearances in clubs like CBGBs. Lunch\u2019s spoken-word performances were equally brutal. In \u201cDaddy Dearest,\u201d she accused her father of sexual abuse starting when she was 6 or 7. (Lunch\u2019s parents both died in the early \u201990s.) When asked, her brother, Robert, could neither confirm nor deny Lunch\u2019s account. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get any indication anything was going on,\u201d he says, \u201cbut it could have happened. If she\u2019s putting it down in words, then that has to be the way it was.\u201d         \n\nHer fans embraced Lunch\u2019s rage about sexual abuse as liberating. \u201cShe is the first singer I ever heard who could invoke female lust and horrific abuse in the same phrase,\u201d says the singer Kathleen Hanna. It was a hard-core image that Lunch continued to hone. In her writings, she boasts of killing a stray cat with a shovel, terrorizing drivers who gave her rides and picking up teenage boys. \u201cIf people have just seen those early, scary films with Richard Kern, I can see how they\u2019re afraid of her,\u201d says V.Vale, the founder of RE/SEARCH Publications, \u201cbut in real life, she\u2019s very generous and empathetic.\u201d Many of her friends describe her as a kind of earth mother. They point to her 2012 cookbook, \u201cThe Need to Feed,\u201d with its recipes for kale chips and jerk chicken. Even her name, they say, reflects her generosity. The band Mink DeVille dubbed her \u201cLunch\u201d because she stole food for them from a bar where she worked. The musician J. G. Thirlwell says that in the seven years they lived together, he even saw her feed the squirrels on their fire escape.         \n\n \n Lunch ranted about the state of the planet, then warmly encouraged the women to purge themselves of shame and anger. When \u201cOOO-AAHH-AAAAA!!!\u201d echoed from the avocado grove where some of the workshop attendees had gathered to do Butoh-inspired movement, Lunch looked up from her laptop and proclaimed the cry \u201cthe sound of feminine power being released into the universe.\u201d Later the women took turns reading lists of their inner demons. Some had pages\u2019 worth; Lunch had hardly any.         \n\n\u201cShe\u2019s had this life of tremendous criminality and brutality,\u201d marveled one workshop member, \u201cbut when we talked about what gnaws at us, she had nothing. I admire how she processes everything so quickly.\u201d Another participant compared her to the Hindu destroyer-mother goddess Kali.         \n\nAt the close of the workshop, Lunch posed for photos with participants. \u201cPleasure is the ultimate rebellion, and these women have had a pleasurable time the past few days,\u201d Lunch said between drags on a Marlboro. \u201cI\u2019m feeling damn fine. I might take my clothes off and jump in the pool.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/22/magazine/finding-inner-peace-with-the-angriest-punk-of-70s-new-york.html", "date": "2013-12-20", "description": "Lydia Lunch has transformed herself into a self-help guru.
