{"headline": "Bike Sharing in New York: The Tourist\u2019s Perspective", "body": "\nWhen New York\u2019s transportation commissioner, Janette Sadik-Khan, announced plans for the city\u2019s  \n at a 2011 press conference she called it \u201ca fast, easy, affordable way to get around town.\u201d         \n\nSo now that the program has kicked off with 6,000 cobalt-blue Citi Bikes at 300 locations south of 59th Street in Manhattan, and in parts of Brooklyn, how fast, easy and affordable is it?         \n\nFor the purposes of this column, of course, affordable comes first. For annual members, who pay $95 plus tax ($60 plus tax in  \n) for a year\u2019s worth of unlimited 45-minute rides, it\u2019s a good deal. It also can be fast: with all those stations a ride is  \n than a subway-and-walk combination. \u201cEasy\u201d might be a stretch, but once local riders get used to the challenges of Manhattan cycling, I\u2019ll grant that to the commissioner as well.         \n\nBut what about for tourists? On Sunday,  \n 24-hour and weekly access passes became available, I planned a day around the city to see if it would be fast, easy and affordable for a traveler new to the city.         \n\nThe answer: not for everyone.         \n\nTo be clear, I\u2019m an unabashed fan of bike sharing and am overjoyed New York finally caught up with many European cities. I also had a great day \u2014 pedaling from Midtown to Murray\u2019s Bagels in the Village for breakfast, then down to the Staten Island Ferry terminal, up to Chinatown for lunch, over to the High Line for a stroll and then back to Midtown for some late-afternoon culture at MoMA. Fast? Yes. But it wasn\u2019t so easy, and it definitely was not cheap.         \n\nIf you don\u2019t know how bike sharing works, it\u2019s pretty much the same around the world: Users pick up bikes at any station and can return it to any other within a specified time frame, often 30 minutes. (There\u2019s almost always a mapping app to find the nearest station.) They can do that as many times as they like, without additional charge, for the rest of the day or week or year. They can also keep the bike longer, but will be charged a bit more; the idea is to use the bikes as transportation, not sheer recreation.         \n\nBut in New York, short-term users pay more \u2014 both overall and when compared with annual members \u2014 than in comparable cities elsewhere.  \n, the daily pass is \u00a32 ($3), about 2 percent the cost of an annual pass.  \n, it\u2019s 1.70 euros ($2.15), 6 percent of an annual pass. In New York, it\u2019s $10.83, tax included, more than 10 percent the cost of a yearly membership.         \n\nPut another way, the cost of a day\u2019s biking in London or Paris is almost precisely the cost of a single subway trip; in New York it\u2019s about four times that amount. (The weekly pass is $25 plus tax, compared with \u00a310 in London and 8 euros in Paris.)         \n\nOf course, the bikes aren\u2019t meant to be a replacement for the subway system, exactly: they\u2019re meant to supplement public transportation and to be enjoyable. But in London and Paris (and Brussels and Berlin and Toulouse, three other cities I\u2019ve been to recently) they clearly save you money as well. That is not the case in New York. The weekly pass is a slightly better deal, but it won\u2019t replace a $30 weekly MetroCard: there are too many trips you can\u2019t make in 30 minutes, and the bikes don\u2019t yet extend north of 59th Street (think Central Park, the Metropolitan Museum, Harlem). Yearly members can take the bikes out for 45 minutes at a time; for daily or weekly members, it\u2019s 30 minutes. And the penalties for going beyond those time frames are steeper for nonsubscribers: $4 for an extra 30 minutes, instead of $2.50.         \n\nFor those considering how this compares with renting a bike from a shop: An all-day rental, including helmet and lock, from  \n in Midtown is $32 with a reservation, $39 without \u2014 but of course that allows you to travel without time limits or geographical restrictions.         \n\nAll that said, if you love biking, or if you will use the bikes to substitute for taxis rather than subways, then the deal doesn\u2019t sound quite as bad. So let\u2019s move on.         \n\nWhat about fast?         \n\nI\u2019d say yes. They are fast. Not literally: the bikes are heavy, so you won\u2019t see program users careening down Broadway like crazed bike messengers. But assuming you\u2019ve mapped out directions in advance, for just about any trip in a 20- to 25-block range, they beat the subway or bus. On all five routes I took, even when I got lost and took roundabout routes to use bike lanes, I never came close to the 30-minute limit, and always ended up within a two-minute walk of my destination \u2014 and sometimes right next to it, like at the  \n. The 15 or 20 minutes each trip took was almost certainly quicker than walk-subway-walk.         \n\nFinally, was it easy? Hey, this is New York: nothing is easy. And there are two learning curves for short-term users. First, the details of the system itself: how to pay, how to remove the bikes, how to plan within those 30-minute limits. But the real shock comes from simply biking on city streets. Despite great improvements in signage and bike lanes, New York is no Copenhagen or Berlin when it comes to biking. You\u2019ll need to get the hang of planning your routes to avoid potential pitfalls like the narrow streets of Chinatown, the jarring cobblestones of SoHo and the nightmarish avenues without bike lanes but with plenty of daredevil cabdrivers.
