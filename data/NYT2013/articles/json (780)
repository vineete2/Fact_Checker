{"headline": "Facing a Recall After Supporting Stronger Gun Laws in Colorado", "body": "\nDENVER \u2014 As he prepared to vote for some of the strictest gun control measures in the country earlier this year, John Morse, a former police chief and president of the State Senate, knew he would infuriate some constituents.         \n\n\u201cThere may be a cost for me to pay, but I am more than happy to pay it,\u201d he said in a recent interview.         \n\nNow, after months of gathering signatures and skirmishing in court, gun activists in Colorado, with the support of the National Rifle Association, have forced Mr. Morse and a fellow Democrat, Senator Angela Giron, into recall elections. The recall effort is seen nationally as a test of whether politicians, largely Democrats, outside big cities and deep-blue coastal states can survive the political fallout of supporting stricter gun laws.         \n\n\u201cLegislators should be scared,\u201d said Becky Mizel, chairwoman of the Republican Party in the old steel and railroad town of Pueblo, Ms. Giron\u2019s home district. \u201cWe have a battle here.\u201d         \n\nAround his Colorado Springs-area district, Mr. Morse has spent the summer in campaign overdrive. He walks door to door, explaining his votes to people in his narrowly divided district.         \n\nAt first, the recall drive was against four Democrats. But the organizers failed to collect the required signatures against two of them, leaving only Mr. Morse and Ms. Giron to face a recall vote on Sept. 10, a first for the state. Voters must decide whether either of the Democrats should be recalled and, if so, who should replace them. So far, only two Republicans \u2014 one a former police officer, the other a former city councilman \u2014 are expected to be on the ballot to replace the incumbents.         \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to turn out to ride me out of town on a rail,\u201d Mr. Morse said. \u201cSymbolically, if you could take me out, that would be a benefit to the special gun interests.\u201d         \n\nFor Colorado gun-rights supporters \u2014 and their allies like the N.R.A. and the Republicans who opposed the gun bills \u2014 the recall elections are a chance to send a message to any politician who would support similar legislation. If Mr. Morse and Ms. Giron survive the recall vote, it might bolster lawmakers in other gun-friendly states to consider more controls on firearms.         \n\nThe recall campaign began just weeks after the state\u2019s Democratic-controlled Legislature passed Colorado\u2019s first new gun limits in more than a decade \u2014 measures that required background checks for private transactions and limited the rounds in ammunition clips.         \n\nTo supporters, the limits were an overdue response to mass shootings that have haunted Colorado since the Columbine High School attack in 1999. But in a state where avid support for hunting and sport shooting crosses generations and partisan lines, the measures drew an angry response from many quarters.         \n\nSupporters of the new gun laws \u2014 including Gov. John W. Hickenlooper, a Democrat \u2014 said they were tailored for Colorado. Lawmakers increased the proposed limits on clip size to 15 rounds from 10, and added provisions to allow parents to pass down guns to their children without a background check. Supporters released opinion polls showing they had the support of solid majorities of Colorado residents.         \n\nBut to Victor Head, a plumber in Pueblo, the new measures were a travesty. One day, Mr. Head said, he was chatting with friends on a Web site for enthusiasts of the AR-15 assault rifle when the discussion shifted to how they could strike back at their legislators.         \n\n\u201cYou can only write so many e-mails and go to so many meetings and protests,\u201d Mr. Head said. \u201cThey have to listen to a recall.\u201d         \n\nDemocrats criticized the recall effort as a waste of time that would cost taxpayers $200,000. They pointed out that Mr. Morse had to step down next year because of term limits, and that Ms. Giron, a first-term senator, would be up for re-election.         \n\nBut gun-rights activists said they needed to act.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sick of saying, \u2018Let\u2019s just wait until next year,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Head said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to send a message.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/29/us/facing-a-recall-after-supporting-stronger-gun-laws-in-colorado.html", "date": "2013-07-28", "description": "A recall election in Colorado serves as a national test of whether politicians can survive the fallout of passing strict gun-control measures."}
