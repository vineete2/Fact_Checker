{"headline": "Justices Weigh Constitutionality of New York Town\u2019s Prayers", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court, which begins its sessions with an invocation to God,  \n whether a town in upstate New York had crossed a constitutional line in opening its Town Board meetings with mostly Christian prayers. The justices seemed to find the issue unusually difficult, with several of them suggesting there was no satisfactory principled answer.         \n\nJustice Elena Kagan, asking the first question, wanted to know whether the Supreme Court could open its sessions with an explicitly Christian prayer from a minister, one acknowledging, for instance, \u201cthe saving sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross.\u201d Such prayers were offered before Town Board meetings in Greece, N.Y., near Rochester.         \n\nThomas G. Hungar, a lawyer for the town, said a 1983 Supreme Court decision allowed Christian prayers in legislative settings, though perhaps not in judicial ones. The decision,  \n, upheld the Nebraska Legislature\u2019s practice of opening its sessions with an invocation from a paid Presbyterian minister, saying such ceremonies were \u201cdeeply embedded in the history and tradition of this country.\u201d         \n\nJustice Anthony M. Kennedy seemed frustrated with Mr. Hungar\u2019s argument, which relied almost exclusively on the Marsh decision and the history it reflected. \u201cThe essence of the argument is that we\u2019ve always done it this way, which has some force to it,\u201d Justice Kennedy said. \u201cBut it seems to me that your argument begins and ends there.\u201d         \n\nAt the same time, Justice Kennedy appeared reluctant to have judges or other government officials decide what prayers are acceptable. Such a practice. he said, \u201cinvolves the state very heavily in the censorship and the approval or disapproval of prayer.\u201d         \n\nJustice Antonin Scalia said prayers in a legislative setting were different from the hypothetical ones in court that Justice Kagan had asked about. \u201cPeople who have religious beliefs,\u201d he said, \u201cought to be able to invoke the deity when they are acting as citizens and not as judges.\u201d         \n\nDouglas Laycock, representing two women who challenged the prayers in New York as a violation of the First Amendment\u2019s ban on government establishment of religion, said there were important differences between the Nebraska case and the new one. The prayers in New York were often explicitly sectarian, he said, and town residents were forced to listen to them in order to participate in local government.         \n\nJustice Samuel A. Alito Jr. asked Mr. Laycock for an example of a prayer that would be acceptable to people of all faiths.         \n\nMr. Laycock said \u201cprayers to the Almighty\u201d and \u201cprayers to the Creator\u201d would be all right.         \n\n\u201cWhat about devil worshipers?\u201d Justice Scalia asked.         \n\nMr. Laycock said that \u201cif devil worshipers believe the devil is the almighty, they might be O.K.\u201d         \n\nJustice Kagan said the wide-ranging discussion, which included questions about polytheism and atheism, missed the key point. \u201cIsn\u2019t the question mostly here in most communities,\u201d she said, \u201cwhether the kind of language that I began with, which refers repeatedly to Jesus Christ, which is language that is accepted and admired and incredibly important to the majority members of a community, but is not accepted by a minority, whether that language will be allowed in a public town session like this one?\u201d         \n\nBut Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., like several of the justices, seemed wary of the government distinguishing acceptable prayers from unacceptable ones. \u201cWho was supposed to make these determinations?\u201d he asked.         \n\nMr. Laycock said town officials could simply tell those offering prayers to avoid discussing \u201cpoints on which believers are known to disagree.\u201d         \n\nIan H. Gershengorn, a deputy solicitor general, argued on behalf of the federal government in support of the town, saying the prayers there were permitted by \u201cour nation\u2019s long history of opening legislative sessions not only with a prayer, but a prayer given in the prayer giver\u2019s own religious idiom.\u201d         \n\nThat position seemed to trouble Justice Kagan. A resident attending a town meeting was, she said, \u201cforced to identify whether she believes in the things that most of the people in the room believe in.\u201d         \n\nMr. Gershengorn acknowledged that \u201cthe strongest argument for the other side\u201d was \u201cthat there is an element of coercion.\u201d         \n\nThe case, Town of Greece v. Galloway, No. 12-696, arose from the Town Board\u2019s practice of starting its public meetings with a prayer from a \u201cchaplain of the month.\u201d Town officials said that members of all faiths and atheists were welcome to give the opening prayer.         \n\nIn practice, the federal appeals court in New York said in ruling against the town that almost all of the chaplains were Christian.         \n\n\u201cA substantial majority of the prayers in the record contained uniquely Christian language,\u201d Judge Guido Calabresi wrote for  \n, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. \u201cRoughly two-thirds contained references to \u2018Jesus Christ,\u2019 \u2018Jesus,\u2019 \u2018Your Son\u2019 or the \u2018Holy Spirit.'\u201d         \n\n\u201cThe town\u2019s prayer practice must be viewed as an endorsement of a particular religious viewpoint,\u201d Judge Calabresi wrote.         \n\nOn Wednesday, Justice Stephen G. Breyer suggested ways in which the conflicting interests in the case might be accommodated, including with an effort to invite chaplains of many faiths. He said the House of Representatives, which starts its sessions with a prayer, told chaplains to bear in mind that the House was \u201ccomprised of members of many different faith traditions.\u201d         \n\nJustice Kennedy suggested that the court might make such suggestions but in a nonbinding way. \u201cShould we write that in a concurring opinion?\u201d he asked.         \n\nSome justices worried that any ruling from the court could do more harm than good. \u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u201d Justice Kagan said, \u201cbecause the court lays down these rules and everybody thinks that the court is being hostile to religion and people get unhappy and angry and agitated in various kinds of ways.\u201d         \n\nJustice Scalia wondered where a ruling from the court would leave nonbelievers. \u201cWhat is the equivalent of prayer for somebody who is not religious?\u201d he asked Mr. Hungar, who had no answer.         \n\nBut Justice Breyer suggested he might have one, though he did not give it. \u201cPerhaps he\u2019s asking me that question,\u201d he said of his colleague, \u201cand I can answer it later.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/07/nyregion/supreme-court-justices-consider-new-york-towns-prayer-practice.html", "date": "2013-11-06", "description": "The Supreme Court questioned lawyers about whether the Town of Greece, N.Y., violated the Constitution in opening board meetings with mostly Christian prayers."}
