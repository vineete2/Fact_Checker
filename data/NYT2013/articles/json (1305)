{"headline": "To Curb Suits, City Now Opts to Fight Them", "body": "\nThe Bloomberg administration has embarked on an aggressive legal strategy intended to curtail the rising number of federal civil-rights lawsuits filed against New York. Instead of offering small settlements to avoid trial, the city started to identify weaker cases and has been contesting them in court, pushing many to trial.         \n\nThe city said it was too early to judge whether the strategy, which began in July 2011, had discouraged lawyers from reflexively suing the city, but it believes the policy has had some effect: after five years where the number of federal civil-rights suits against the city had increased, the number declined slightly in the most recent fiscal year.         \n\nThe city also noted that the number of such suits that are dismissed or withdrawn before trial rose by about 75 percent in the first year after the policy went into effect.         \n\nThose cases had been typically viewed as not being worth the time or expense to fight in court. But city officials said they had concluded that while settling small-scale federal lawsuits might have been expedient, it did nothing to discourage lawyers from bringing marginal lawsuits.         \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re sort of feeding the monster, if you will,\u201d said  \n, the city\u2019s corporation counsel and top lawyer. \u201cSo we started saying to ourselves, \u2018Let\u2019s be more aggressive here.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nThe city\u2019s Law Department directed its staff to identify civil-rights lawsuits that it believed were based on weak evidentiary or legal grounds, city lawyers said. Those cases were designated \u201cno-pay\u201d cases.         \n\nThe city would seek to have such cases \u2014 which typically accuse the city of rights violations like false arrest, malicious prosecution or use of excessive force \u2014 withdrawn or dismissed, and where that failed, it would forgo settlement talks and push them to trial.         \n\nSince then, the city says it has taken 20 no-pay cases to trial, winning 16 and losing 3. (One resulted in a mistrial, which the city won when it was retried.)         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a saying that I will paraphrase: The definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting a different result,\u201d Muriel Goode-Trufant, a senior city lawyer, said. \u201cIn order to get a different result, we needed to try something different.\u201d         \n\nAbout 60 cases are currently pending trial; the city has declined to settle 52 of those cases, Ms. Goode-Trufant said recently.         \n\nShe said the city had also begun pushing more cases to trial in which the plaintiff had rejected the city\u2019s last settlement offer. Over the past year and a half, she added, the city has won two-thirds of about 30 such trials that have been held.         \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re boasting about it, both to us and the court,\u201d said Gabriel P. Harvis, a plaintiff\u2019s lawyer whose firm was involved in three of the recent trials. (The firm lost one, had a mistrial and, in a third, won $600 in damages and collected $78,000 in legal fees.)         \n\nIn the past, Mr. Harvis added, \u201cI think it was a foregone conclusion that there would be a settlement of virtually every case.\u201d         \n\nAnother plaintiff\u2019s lawyer, Gerald M. Cohen, whose firm has been involved in four such trials, said the city\u2019s new approach had made him more selective about which lawsuits he brought.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be honest: we kind of got fat and lazy,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. \u201cWe were settling all of these cases. But this actually forces us to do more, and creates the potential to be more successful for our clients and for ourselves.\u201d         \n\nMr. Cohen\u2019s firm lost two trials but also beat the city twice, including winning a $190,000 verdict in a false-arrest suit in which the judge also awarded $208,000 in legal fees.         \n\nThe city, which has appealed the verdict, said that case was an example of a lawsuit it pushed to trial after the plaintiff, Joshua Marshall, rejected its last offer. (One of Mr. Marshall\u2019s lawyers, Jon L. Norinsberg, said that offer was for $10,000.)         \n\n\u201cWe would have settled that case for $30,000,\u201d said Mr. Norinsberg, a former city lawyer, who criticized the city\u2019s strategy as \u201cterribly misguided.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI think in the end, it\u2019s going to cost the city much more money than it\u2019s going to save,\u201d he added.
