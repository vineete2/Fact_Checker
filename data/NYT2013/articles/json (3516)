{"headline": "Firm Is Accused of Sending Spam, and Fight Jams Internet", "body": "\nA squabble between a group fighting spam and a Dutch company that hosts Web sites said to be sending spam has escalated into one of the largest computer attacks on the Internet, causing widespread congestion and jamming crucial infrastructure around the world.         \n\nMillions of ordinary Internet users have experienced delays in services or could not reach a particular Web site for a short time.         \n\nHowever, for the Internet engineers who run the global network the problem is more worrisome. The attacks are becoming increasingly powerful, and computer security experts worry that if they continue to escalate people may not be able to reach basic Internet services, like e-mail and online banking.         \n\nThe dispute started when the spam-fighting group, called Spamhaus, added the Dutch company Cyberbunker to its blacklist, which is used by e-mail providers to weed out spam. Cyberbunker, named for its headquarters, a five-story former NATO bunker, offers hosting services to any Web site \u201cexcept child porn and anything related to terrorism,\u201d according to its Web site.         \n\nA spokesman for Spamhaus, which is based in Europe, said the attacks began on March 19, but had not stopped the group from distributing its blacklist.         \n\nPatrick Gilmore, chief architect at Akamai Technologies, a digital content provider, said Spamhaus\u2019s role was to generate a list of Internet spammers.         \n\nOf Cyberbunker, he added: \u201cThese guys are just mad. To be frank, they got caught. They think they should be allowed to spam.\u201d         \n\nMr. Gilmore said that the attacks, which are generated by swarms of computers called botnets, concentrate data streams that are larger than the Internet connections of entire countries. He likened the technique, which uses a long-known flaw in the Internet\u2019s basic plumbing, to using a machine gun to spray an entire crowd when the intent is to kill one person.         \n\nThe attacks were first mentioned publicly last week by CloudFlare, an Internet security firm in Silicon Valley that was trying to defend against the attacks and as a result became a target.         \n\n\u201cThese things are essentially like nuclear bombs,\u201d said Matthew Prince, chief executive of CloudFlare. \u201cIt\u2019s so easy to cause so much damage.\u201d         \n\nThe so-called distributed denial of service, or DDoS, attacks have reached previously unknown magnitudes, growing to a data stream of 300 billion bits per second.         \n\n\u201cIt is a real number,\u201d Mr. Gilmore said. \u201cIt is the largest publicly announced DDoS attack in the history of the Internet.\u201d         \n\nSpamhaus, one of the most prominent groups tracking spammers on the Internet, uses volunteers to identify spammers and has been described as an online vigilante group.         \n\nIn the past, blacklisted sites have retaliated against Spamhaus with denial-of-service attacks, in which they flood Spamhaus with traffic requests from personal computers until its servers become unreachable. But in recent weeks, the attackers hit back with a far more powerful strike that exploited the Internet\u2019s core infrastructure, called the Domain Name System, or DNS.         \n\nThat system functions like a telephone switchboard for the Internet. It translates the names of Web sites like Facebook.com or  \n into a string of numbers that the Internet\u2019s underlying technology can understand. Millions of computer servers around the world perform the actual translation.         \n\nIn the latest incident, attackers sent messages, masquerading as ones coming from Spamhaus, to those machines, which were then amplified drastically by the servers, causing torrents of data to be aimed back at the Spamhaus computers.         \n\nWhen Spamhaus requested aid from CloudFlare, the attackers began to focus their digital ire on the companies that provide data connections for both Spamhaus and CloudFlare.         \n\nQuestioned about the attacks, Sven Olaf Kamphuis, an Internet activist who said he was a spokesman for the attackers, said in an online message that, \u201cWe are aware that this is one of the largest DDoS attacks the world had publicly seen.\u201d Mr. Kamphuis said Cyberbunker was retaliating against Spamhaus for \u201cabusing their influence.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/27/technology/internet/online-dispute-becomes-internet-snarling-attack.html", "date": "2013-03-26", "description": "A squabble between a group battling spam and a Web hosting company said to be sending it has escalated into an attack clogging up infrastructure worldwide."}
