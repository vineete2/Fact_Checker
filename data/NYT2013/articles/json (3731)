{"headline": "Gay and Married Couples in New Land of Taxation", "body": "\nIt\u2019s now official: same-sex married couples across the country are allowed to check one of the \u201cmarried\u201d boxes on their  \n, even if their own state doesn\u2019t recognize their union.         \n\nMany of those couples who fought long and hard to win that right may pleasantly find themselves paying Uncle Sam far less and may even get a refund from previous years. (But plenty of others will pay more.)         \n\nThe Internal Revenue Service this week set down the rules that will cost or save a particular couple money. That will depend on how much they earn, whether both spouses are working, and whether, together, they earn too much to claim the same sort of tax-saving deductions and credits they did when they were filing as singles (many of which phase out as income rise).         \n\nThe rules also begin to clarify how couples residing in the 37 states that do not sanction same-sex marriages will fare. (Warning: Filing state returns won\u2019t be easy, but not so bad that you\u2019ll consider moving.)         \n\nGay couples can now plan for how their financial lives will change when it comes to federal taxes, even though big questions remain about benefits like Social Security and veterans\u2019 benefits. The ruling applies to a broad range of tax rules where marriage comes into play, and some will result in major savings. Some couples will no longer have to pay thousands of dollars in taxes on the value of their spouse\u2019s health insurance, something their opposite-sex peers did not have to pay. Individuals can inherit a spouse\u2019s retirement account and other assets without any extra tax implications. Nonworking spouses will be able to open an I.R.A. on their spouse\u2019s earnings record. And the list goes on.         \n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court opened the door to nationwide recognition of same-sex marriage, but the Internal Revenue Service swung it wide open,\u201d said John McGowan, who heads the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender practice at Northern Trust.         \n\nFirst the best news: If you would have received a refund by filing a joint federal return, you can generally collect that money for the last three years. (Keep reading, I\u2019ll tell you how below). If you would have owed money, you are under no obligation to pay more.         \n\nFor the 2013 tax year, all legally married couples will be required to file their returns together as either \u201cmarried filing jointly\u201d or \u201cmarried filing separately,\u201d according to the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service, which announced the rules on Thursday. That\u2019s the case even if, for instance, a gay couple legally married in the District of Columbia goes back home to Virginia where gay  \n         \n\nHere are some answers to several questions that may be on couples\u2019 minds:         \n\n \n Generally speaking, couples will pay less in federal income tax when one person earns much less than the other or does not work at all. High-income couples with two working spouses will probably pay more. That\u2019s the marriage penalty. You\u2019re welcome.         \n\nA married same-sex couple in which one spouse earns $100,000 and one stays at home with their child will save about $4,200 in federal taxes by filing a joint federal return, according to Pan Haskins, an accountant in Oakland, Calif., who works with gay couples. \u00a0(If the same couple lived in a community property state like California, Washington or Nevada, their federal taxes would be the same as married couples in other states, but they would pay about $600 more than they pay now.)         \n\n \n If a couple would have received a federal tax refund had they filed a joint return, they are entitled to claim that money for three years from the date the return was filed or two years from the date the tax was paid, whichever is later,  \n. So generally speaking, most people will be able to amend their returns for 2010, 2011 and 2012. Taxpayers should use I.R.S. Form  \n, which will allow them to amend previous returns.         \n\n \n Perhaps. Unlike straight married couples, most gay individuals with same-sex spouses who were covered by their employer\u2019s health plan owed income taxes on the value of that coverage (unless the employer paid them for the employee,  \n. In addition, these workers also paid for their portion of the premium using after-tax dollars instead of being able to pay pretax and reduce their taxable income.         \n\nIf you paid those extra taxes, you can claim a refund on both of those items, according to the I.R.S. (which said it would be issuing streamlined procedures to help taxpayers). So if you paid extra income taxes on, say, $3,000 worth of health insurance annually for each of the last three years, or $9,000, you could get a nice chunk of money back, depending on your tax bracket.         \n\n \n If you live in a state that recognizes your union, your life just got much easier. Couples residing in places like California, Massachusetts or New York can file a joint federal tax return as well as a joint state return, just as opposite-sex couples do.         \n\nBut it\u2019s not entirely clear what will happen in each of the states that do not recognize same-sex marriage, experts said, since some states require that a taxpayer\u2019s state return filing status mirror their federal return. \u201cI love that state taxing authorities are having to wrestle with this,\u201d said \n, a professor at Santa Clara University School of Law and an expert on sexuality and federal tax law. \u201cIt does remain to be seen, but it is likely that you won\u2019t be filing jointly at the state level\u201d if your state does not recognize your union.         \n\nIf that\u2019s the case, filing your state tax return will become more cumbersome. Each spouse will probably need to fill out a dummy federal return as if they were filing on their own (either as single or head of household) and then transfer the information on that return to their state return, which also must be filled out as single or head of household, according to tax experts. \u201cIt will be awkward, it will be time-consuming, but not necessarily difficult,\u201d said \n, who leads the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender practice at Marcum, an accounting firm.
