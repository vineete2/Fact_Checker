{"headline": "How to Spend 47 Hours on a Train and Not Go Crazy", "body": "\nVickie, Alice, Lisa, Debbie, Barbara, Chris, Clair and Cootz boarded the Los Angeles-bound Sunset Limited in Schriever, La., and immediately took residence in the glass-sheathed Sightseer Lounge car. The eight women squeezed into two booths on either side of the aisle and began to scream with laughter.         \n\nWith a quiet, pneumatic exhalation, the Sunset Limited left the station; it was 90 minutes into its journey, with 45 hours and 5 minutes to go. After leaving New Orleans Union Passenger Terminal, its point of departure, the seven-car train had rumbled first alongside the New Orleans Arena, where the Hornets play basketball, and then alongside the empty open-air courts, separated from the tracks by chain-link fence and concertina wire, where inmates at Orleans Parish Prison play basketball. It climbed steadily for two miles before passing over the dizzyingly narrow span of the Huey P. Long Bridge. From up there, 145 feet above the Mississippi River, the river\u2019s full double turn, like a lowercase m written in a lazy cursive, was visible; you could see why they called New Orleans the Crescent City.         \n\nWheezing out of Schriever, the train rattled and jerked, and when I entered the lounge car, I had to grab onto the back of a booth to prevent myself from falling facedown in Clair\u2019s lap.         \n\n\u201cWoo!\u201d screamed the eight ladies, as if cheering on a toreador. \u201cHey-ey!\u201d \u201cChoo-choo!\u201d They dissolved into hysterics. It was a little past 10 a.m. They had told each other that they wouldn\u2019t dip into their vodka until noon.         \n\nCootz was 52 years and 364 days old, and they were celebrating. \u201cWe wanted to take a long train ride together,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we weren\u2019t sure how long we could last. This is a trial run.\u201d They left their husbands at home in Thibodaux (\u201cThey\u2019re happy to let us go,\u201d Lisa said) and were traveling to Lake Charles, a five-hour ride, where they would check into L\u2019Auberge Casino Resort. After gambling for two days, they would return. If everything went well, they might make it an annual trip. Why, they could go to Memphis (8 hours, 15 minutes), Houston (9 hours, 18 minutes), even San Antonio (15 hours, 5 minutes). They were dressed smartly in pearls, dark sunglasses, shawls, silver bracelets, silver watches and silver medallions with lapis lazuli. Most of the women appeared to have styled their hair especially for the excursion. Alice possessed a vaporous cloud of wavy brown hair \u2014 her husband called it \u201cbig, sexy hair.\u201d Barbara had what she described as a gray dome. She said that when the eight of them got together, it was only so long before someone started catching the wall.         \n\n\u201cSomeone show that boy how to catch the wall!\u201d         \n\nBarbara pulled out her phone and showed videos of friends catching the wall. There are three steps to catching the wall. First, you go down on your hands and knees on the floor, facing away from a wall. Then you jog your legs up the wall, one at a time, until you\u2019re halfway to a headstand. Finally, with your palms planted on the ground, your feet planted on the wall and your butt sticking up in the air, you jiggle. \u201cMy stomach hurts because we laugh so much,\u201d Barbara said between laughing fits. \u201cIt\u2019s like an aerobic exercise. We\u2019ll all have six-packs by the time we get off the train.\u201d         \n\nThe women were playing Pedro (\u201cPEE-dro\u201d), a card game popular in Cajun country, something of a cross between bridge and spades. For their trip, Cootz printed out special scorecards on which she had typed her friends\u2019 names. They had played Pedro as long as they could remember; it was not uncommon for them to play for 12 hours at a time. While they played, they sang. Lisa led the group in a round of \u201cGas-Food-Lodging,\u201d a song she wrote when she was 7. Her friends knew all the words.         \n\nSix of the women had been teachers; Clair is an office manager; and Barbara was a secretary \u2014 a \u201csexy-tery,\u201d she clarified. Four were the exact same age. Debbie\u2019s and Chris\u2019s husbands worked together. Alice, Vickie and Cootz taught together at St. Joseph Catholic Elementary School. Chris had been Alice\u2019s second-grade teacher. (\u201cShe was extremely stylish, with her brown suede boots,\u201d Alice said. \u201cShe\u2019s the reason I wear boots today.\u201d) Vickie, Lisa, Clair and Cootz attended E. D. White high school. All eight women attended Nicholls State University in Thibodaux. Vickie, Debbie and Chris were sorority sisters. Lisa Ford Ray and Clair Ford Lee were cousins.
