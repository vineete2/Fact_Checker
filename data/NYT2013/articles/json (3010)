{"headline": "Pentagon Finds Nuclear Strides by North Korea", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A new assessment by the Pentagon\u2019s intelligence arm has concluded for the first time, with \u201cmoderate confidence,\u201d that  \n has learned how to make a nuclear weapon small enough to be delivered by a ballistic missile.         \n\nThe assessment by the  \n, which has been distributed to senior administration officials and members of Congress, cautions that the weapon\u2019s \u201creliability will be low,\u201d apparently a reference to the North\u2019s difficulty in developing accurate missiles or, perhaps, to the huge technical challenges of designing a warhead that can survive the rigors of flight and detonate on a specific target.         \n\nThe assessment\u2019s existence was disclosed Thursday by Representative Doug Lamborn, Republican of Colorado, three hours into a budget hearing of the House Armed Services Committee with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey. General Dempsey declined to comment on the assessment because of classification issues.         \n\nBut late Thursday, the director of national intelligence,  \n, released a statement saying that the assessment did not represent a consensus of the nation\u2019s intelligence community and that \u201cNorth Korea has not yet demonstrated the full range of capabilities necessary for a nuclear armed missile.\u201d         \n\nIn another sign of the administration\u2019s deep concern over the release of the assessment, the Pentagon press secretary, George Little, issued a statement that sought to qualify the conclusion from the Defense Intelligence Agency, which has primary responsibility for monitoring the missile capabilities of adversary nations but which a decade ago was among those that argued most vociferously \u2014 and incorrectly \u2014 that Iraq had  \n.         \n\n\u201cIt would be inaccurate to suggest that the North Korean regime has fully tested, developed or demonstrated the kinds of nuclear capabilities referenced in the passage,\u201d Mr. Little said.         \n\nA spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry, Kim Min-seok, said early Friday that despite various assessments. \u201cwe have doubt that North Korea has reached the stage of miniaturization.\u201d         \n\nNonetheless, outside experts said that the report\u2019s conclusions could explain why Mr. Hagel has announced in recent weeks that the Pentagon was bolstering long-range antimissile defenses in Alaska and California, intended to protect the West Coast, and rushing another antimissile system, originally not set for deployment until 2015, to Guam.         \n\nAlso Thursday, Mr. Clapper sought to tamp down fears that North Korean rhetoric could lead to an armed clash with the United States, South Korea and regional allies, and a high South Korean official called for dialogue with North Korea.         \n\nMr. Clapper told a hearing of the House Intelligence Committee that in his experience, two other confrontations with the North \u2014 the seizure of the Navy spy ship Pueblo in 1968 and the death of two military officers in a tree-cutting episode in the demilitarized zone in 1976 \u2014 stoked much greater tensions between the two countries. The statement by the South Korean official, Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-jae, was televised nationally, and it represented a considerable softening in tone by President Park Geun-hye\u2019s government.         \n\nSecretary of State John Kerry, meanwhile, was scheduled to arrive in Seoul on Friday and to travel to China and Japan after that. He has two principal goals on the last leg of a six-nation trip: to encourage China to use its influence to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program while reassuring South Korea and Japan that the United States remains committed to their defense.         \n\nThe report issued by the Defense Intelligence Agency last month was titled \u201cDynamic Threat Assessment 8099: North Korea Nuclear Weapons Program.\u201d Its executive summary reads: \u201cD.I.A. assesses with moderate confidence the North currently has nuclear weapons capable of delivery by ballistic missiles; however the reliability will be low.\u201d         \n\nA spokesman for Mr. Lamborn, Catherine Mortensen, said the material he quoted during the hearing was unclassified. Pentagon officials said later that while the report remained classified, the one-paragraph finding had been declassified but not released. Republicans in Congress have led efforts to increase money for missile defense, and Mr. Lamborn has been critical of the Obama administration for failing to finance it adequately.         \n\nNorth Korea has conducted three nuclear tests, including one this year, and shot a ballistic missile as far as the Philippines in December. American and South Korean intelligence agencies believe that another test \u2014 perhaps of a midrange missile called the Musudan that can reach Japan, South Korea and almost as far as Guam \u2014 may be conducted in the coming days, to celebrate the birth of Kim Il-sung, the country\u2019s founder. At the Pentagon, there is particular concern about another missile, yet untested, called the KN-08, which may have significantly longer range.         \n\n\u201cNorth Korea has already demonstrated capabilities that threaten the United States and the security environment in East Asia,\u201d Mr. Clapper told the House Intelligence Committee.
