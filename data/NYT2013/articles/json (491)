{"headline": "Who Made That Kickstand?", "body": "\n\u201cLike many bike accessories, the kickstand was reinvented various times,\u201d says David V. Herlihy, author of \u201cBicycle: The History.\u201d Herlihy likes to point to what is surely the world\u2019s first blueprint for a kickstand, drawn by a Frenchman named Alfred Berruyer in 1869.It was designed for an early bicycle, a model whose frame rode high off the ground; Berruyer, lacking a convenient spot to bolt his kickstand, attached it beneath the handlebars. Which meant that the kickstand had to be enormous. In his sketch (see sidebar), it looks as if it might have been two feet long. A contemporary of Berruyer\u2019s praised the invention as perfect for bons vivants who might like to stop and rest on the seats of their bicycles to light a cigar or enjoy the scenery.         \n\nIn 1926, Eldon Henderson patented another kind of kickstand. Short, discreet and suited to the modern bike, it could flip up and tuck under the frame. This type of kickstand caught on in the decades that followed, as kids cruised around the suburbs on two-wheeled behemoths that might weigh 50 pounds and needed to be propped up.         \n\nIn the 1970s, with the introduction of the wispy 10-speed racer, the tide turned. Detractors called the kickstand a useless appendage that added extra pounds to the elegant frames. \u201cRiding a bike with a kickstand is like going to a prom in dungarees,\u201d wrote Eugene Sloane, author of a series of popular bike-repair manuals. Many of today\u2019s cyclists grew up in the era of anti-kickstand sentiment and so do not use one, Herlihy says. Besides, most urban neighborhoods now provide racks designed to cradle bikes and hold them upright. The city itself has become an enormous kickstand.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \nMy friends and I were talking about treadmill desks \u2014 the desks you combine with an exercise machine so that you can walk while you work. And I thought, Wouldn\u2019t it be cool if I could ride a bike at my desk?         \n\n \n When we launched the desks in 2011, I thought the customer would want an opulent desk, and we made it out of premium steel. On the larger desks, you could slide the tabletop out of the way so that you could change gears while keeping your monitor and everything else in position. But those were priced at about $1,700. We were really taken aback by the response that we got \u2014 thousands of hits per day to our Web site. The feedback was pretty consistent. It was like, This is a really cool idea, but it\u2019s too expensive, I can\u2019t afford it. So we\u2019ve just redesigned the whole desk, and we\u2019ve dropped the price to $349.         \n\n \n Right. The desk is for people who already own a bike. And you have to buy your own training stand to hold up the bike and create resistance when you pedal.         \n\n \n It can. We recommend that people have different saddles if they\u2019re going to be working on it throughout the course of the day.
