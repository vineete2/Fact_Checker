{"headline": "Now Taking World Cup Bookings, Rio\u2019s Slums", "body": "\nRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014  \n still boom through the streets. Drug dealers still ply their trade in the labyrinth of alleyways. Residents of the Rocinha neighborhood still fume over the brutal tactics of the police, who were recently charged with  \n an impoverished bricklayer.         \n\nBut with hotel rooms in perilously short supply and even modest hostels in Rio de Janeiro charging as much as $450 for a bed during the World Cup in Brazil next year, the residents of Rocinha and other favelas, or slums, are making the most of the city\u2019s acute shortage of lodging for the event: They are renting out their homes to fans from around the globe.         \n\nMaria Clara dos Santos, 49, is preparing to take as many as 10 World Cup visitors into her three-bedroom home in Rocinha (pronounced ho-SEEN-ya), which commands a stunning view of Ipanema\u2019s sun-kissed beaches in the distance. True, Ms. dos Santos notes, untreated sewage reeks on her street and steel bars on her windows are needed to deter break-ins, so she is offering guests a comparative bargain \u2014 about $50 a night to stay with her during the tournament.         \n\n\u201cWe can provide a level of human warmth and authenticity that places down below cannot,\u201d she said, reflecting the growing popularity of favelas for their vibrant musical scenes, cheaper prices and absence of pretension compared with ritzier parts of town.         \n\nHousing tourists in Rio\u2019s slums might well turn out to be one of the smoother aspects of preparing for the World Cup, an event that has been more a source of contention for Brazil than a crowning achievement in its push for global acclaim.         \n\nHuge cost overruns and chronic delays as well as  \n involving workers falling to their deaths or being crushed by towering cranes are bedeviling the lavish stadiums under construction.         \n\nThe Brazilian football confederation remains tarnished by bribery scandals at its highest levels. And if the  \n against government spending for the World Cup were not enough, anger is now building over the costly transportation projects intended to get soccer fans to the matches. Some will not even be completed before the last goal in the tournament is scored.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real lack of robust governance structures here to deal with an event this size, so things start breaking and people start dying,\u201d said Christopher Gaffney, a scholar at Brazil\u2019s Federal Fluminense University who studies large sporting projects. \u201cThe absurd prices ahead of the World Cup are part of this phenomenon. People perceive the event as bringing only short-term benefits, so they\u2019re seizing on the immediate opportunities around the event.\u201d         \n\nBrazilian authorities expect the nation to receive as many as 600,000 foreign tourists around the month of the World Cup, which starts in June and will be held in 12 cities. Here in Rio, which will host the tournament\u2019s final game, hotel operators are clearly salivating at the coming influx.         \n\nOne reason: The city has only about 55,400 hotel beds for as many as 300,000 expected visitors, leading rates to surge to an average of about $460 a night, roughly double what they regularly cost, according to a report by Brazil\u2019s state tourism agency.         \n\nAlfredo Lopes, the president of the Brazil Hotel Industry Association\u2019s Rio chapter, said the price increases should be expected. \u201cRio\u2019s image is being exalted around the world at this time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be absurd to try to regulate hotel prices when there are people prepared to pay what the market determines is the correct price.\u201d         \n\nGoing further, Mr. Lopes compared Rio with certain coveted luxury brands. \u201cSome people are prepared to pay triple the money for a Harley-Davidson than for another motorcycle, and there\u2019s a reason for that,\u201d he said. \u201cThe same goes for Rio,\u201d he added.         \n\nNever mind that the state of Rio de Janeiro is grappling with a new crime wave,  \n around the city, the shooting of a 25-year-old German tourist in Rocinha\u00a0 and a string of muggings on beaches frequented by foreign tourists.         \n\nFor those who cannot afford to stay in Rio\u2019s more glamorous districts, or who are simply turned off by the city\u2019s already high hotel rates, favela lodgings are emerging as an alluring option.         \n\n\u201cI wanted to learn more about the heart of Brazil, rather than the facade,\u201d said Isom Hightower, 30, an aviation consultant from San Francisco now paying around $11 a night for a bunk bed in a Rocinha guesthouse.
