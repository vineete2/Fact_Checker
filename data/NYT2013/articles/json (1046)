{"headline": "Cornered by Accusations, Christie Parries With Jokes and Stonewalls With Snarls", "body": "\nGov.  \n is a wonderfully primal New Jersey politician who embraces three truths: Transparency is for squares, bluster is your friend and fingerprints are a pain.         \n\nA host of circumstantial evidence, not to mention a mother lode of common sense, suggests that aides close to him shut several traffic ramps to the George Washington Bridge after the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee failed to see the wisdom in endorsing the Republican governor.         \n\nLegislators are investigating. To date, the governor\u2019s childhood friend has resigned his position at the Port Authority, along with the governor\u2019s top appointee there. When a legislator asked about a culture of fear, top officials fell into sheepish silence.         \n\nBut no one sold out the governor. In fact, Mr. Christie all but did a public pirouette, joking that, oh yeah, he moved those traffic cones himself.         \n\nFunny guy.         \n\nMr. Christie deploys his moves with muscular artistry. His administration announced last spring it would use federal disaster dollars to produce a public-relations campaign for the storm-ravaged Jersey Shore.         \n\nTwo ad firms were finalists. Sigma Group and its partner Weber Shandwick cut costs to $2.5 million. But the evaluation committee gave it to MWW and Brushfire, at $4.7 million.         \n\nHere the coincidences pile up. The winning proposal from MWW noted that its vice president of public affairs once ran the Burlington County Republican Committee.         \n\nMichele Brown, chief executive officer of the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, led the selection team. A former federal prosecutor, she ran into a patch of trouble six years ago when she took a $46,000 loan from her boss, then United States attorney, Chris Christie.         \n\nShe resigned but Mr. Christie did not forget her. Upon becoming governor, he appointed her economic development czar at a salary of $225,000. Several New Jersey newspapers noted she lacked the technical background and expertise to participate in the selection process.         \n\nThe winning ad firm\u2019s proposed campaign prominently featured the governor and his family. Its television campaign, \u201cStronger Than the Storm,\u201d ran all last summer. Each commercial ended with Mr. Christie, wearing a pink dress shirt on a boardwalk with his family. \u201cBecause we\u2019re stronger than the storm,\u201d he says to the camera.         \n\nThere was a final stone-cold coincidence: Mr. Christie was running for re-election at the time.         \n\nI called Shannon Morris of Sigma Group, which had the losing bid. She is an award-winning pro. But she is not a political player and she admitted that her proposal did not include the governor. \u201cThe Jersey Shore has such a strong identity; it is iconic,\u201d Ms. Morris said. \u201cI thought Chris Christie was distracting.\u201d         \n\nHer oops, right?         \n\nThe Asbury Park Press asked to see the bid papers. They ran afoul of another Christie rule: Transparency is for chumps.         \n\nState officials told The Asbury Park Press there were \u201chundreds of potentially responsive documents.\u201d It promised to roll those out in early October.         \n\nThat did not happen. As  \n, the state released some documents in December, hours after the article appeared on its website.         \n\nFinally, there\u2019s the shore reconstruction, which has bumped along with more than a few flat tires. Months ago, the Fair Share Housing Center, a well-known advocacy group, asked to examine detailed information about the recovery. Then they waited and waited and eventually a state judge peered at state lawyers and suggested, pointedly: Settle this.         \n\nIt turned out that there are great disparities between the aid given to black and Latino families, and white families. State officials also did not complete their eligibility manual until October, past the application deadline.         \n\nThe Fair Share Housing Center unearthed a script for the housing assistance line. Should questions from the displaced prove time-consuming, employees were advised to reply: \u201cI wish I had more time to talk with you, but I have a lot of your neighbors on hold waiting to speak with me.\u201d         \n\nAs stonewalling had failed him, and as his administration\u2019s fingerprints were unfortunately spackled all over these documents, the governor turned to a reliable standby: The snarl.         \n\n\u201cJust so it\u2019s general notice to all of you, don\u2019t ask me any questions about Fair Share Housing,\u201d said Mr. Christie. It not worth \u201cmy time or my breath.\u201d         \n\nI told Ms. Morris that the governor has said he wants to run another round of ads. Would she bid again?         \n\nShe paused several beats. \u201cOh my gosh, would you bid again if you were me?\u201d         \n\nIn New Jersey, probably not.
