{"headline": "Absence of Trust Fuels Yankees\u2019 Melodrama", "body": "\nARLINGTON, Tex. \u2014 As the Yankees dressed for batting practice Tuesday, a television in the visitors\u2019 clubhouse at Rangers Ballpark blared the latest report of distress between the Yankees and Alex Rodriguez, their $275 million faded star.         \n\n\u201cWhy is this so loud?\u201d pitcher Phil Hughes said.         \n\nThe noise surrounding Rodriguez has become deafening over the past month, an unwelcome soundtrack for a season of flagging expectations. The Yankees have fallen into fourth place, six and a half games behind the first-place Red Sox. The din is expected to intensify as the Yankees are forced to figure out what do with Rodriguez, a player who is still owed nearly $100 million, who is challenging the team doctor\u2019s medical judgment, and who is a target of Major League Baseball\u2019s investigation into performance-enhancing drugs.         \n\nThis unusual melodrama, sometimes bordering on farce, is fueled by increasing distrust and animosity. Most immediately, the team and the player once regarded as the game\u2019s best are feuding over whether Rodriguez\u2019s left quadriceps muscle is healthy.         \n\nRodriguez wants to play now and does not trust the Yankees\u2019 medical evaluations, according to two people with knowledge of the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity. The Yankees are making him wait at least another week.         \n\nAfter a tense conference call with all the parties Thursday afternoon, including Rodriguez\u2019s lawyer, Rodriguez grudgingly agreed that he would play in a simulated or minor league game on Aug. 1 and could return to the team a day or two later.         \n\nIt may have been the first conference call in baseball history in which the player\u2019s lawyer participated in a discussion about a mild thigh injury. But the presence of Rodriguez\u2019s lawyer on the call is only one indication of the level of distrust that exists.         \n\nThe Yankees are considering disciplinary action against Rodriguez \u2014 most likely a fine \u2014 according to a team official who asked not to be named because he was not permitted to speak publicly on the matter. They will charge that Rodriguez violated the collective bargaining agreement when he sought a second opinion for his quadriceps injury. Rodriguez could respond by filing a grievance.         \n\n\u201cI would not comment,\u201d General Manager Brian Cashman said Thursday regarding a possible team-imposed penalty for Rodriguez.         \n\nThe most recent chapter of this saga began Sunday, when Rodriguez was on the verge of being activated after 19 days of playing in the minor leagues to rehabilitate his surgically repaired hip. Rodriguez had complained the night before of tightness in his quad and said he could not play third base but could bat.         \n\nSo the Yankees sent him to New York on Sunday night to have a magnetic resonance imaging test and see the team physician Dr. Christopher Ahmad. Rodriguez, sensing a conspiracy to keep him from playing Monday as scheduled, found the urgent timing of the M.R.I. suspicious. The Yankees steadfastly deny they are blocking Rodriguez from returning.         \n\n\u201cThe hope on the Yankees\u2019 end has always been to have Alex back as soon as possible,\u201d Cashman said.         \n\nDr. Ahmad diagnosed a Grade 1 strain, and Rodriguez was told to rest for about a week, similar to Ahmad\u2019s recommendation for Derek Jeter, who is recovering from a similar injury.         \n\nAccording to one of the officials, Rodriguez called the Yankees\u2019 president, Randy Levine, at home late Tuesday night and told him that he did not trust the Yankees\u2019 physician, Dr. Ahmad, and had sought a second opinion. He did not mention the name of the doctor. It was left that they would discuss the matter further Wednesday, the official said. That morning, Levine and Cashman called the Yankees\u2019 trainer at their minor league facility in Tampa, Fla., where Rodriguez is rehabilitating.         \n\nThe trainer, Tim Lentych, has been helping Rodriguez in his rehabilitation from his off-season hip operation. Cashman and Levine told Lentych to get Rodriguez on the phone, but Rodriguez said he was busy with his workout, the official said. Lentych told Cashman and Levine that he informed Rodriguez to call them back. He never did.
