{"headline": "Ousted General in Egypt Is Back, as Islamists\u2019 Foe", "body": "\nCAIRO \u2014 A year after the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak, the man responsible for rooting out government corruption, Gen. Mohamed Farid el-Tohamy, faced a very public barrage of allegations that he had deliberately covered up years of cronyism and self-dealing.         \n\nPresident Mohamed Morsi promptly fired the general, prosecutors opened an investigation, the news filled the papers and his career appeared to end in disgrace.         \n\nBut now the general is back, and more powerful than ever. His prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and friend, Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi, ousted Mr. Morsi about four months ago, and virtually the first move by the new government was to rehabilitate General Tohamy and place him in charge of the general intelligence service, one of the most powerful positions in Egypt.         \n\nWestern diplomats and Egyptians close to the government say General Tohamy has emerged as the leading advocate of the lethal crackdown on Mr. Morsi\u2019s Islamist supporters in the Muslim Brotherhood, in a drive to eviscerate the movement.         \n\nAny public trace of the corruption charges \u2014 leveled by one of the general\u2019s own investigators \u2014 has disappeared.         \n\n\u201cWhat happened to the prosecutors\u2019 claim of evidence of his corruption and obstruction of justice?\u201d asked Hossam Bahgat, one of the few Egyptian human rights advocates willing to publicly criticize General Tohamy. \u201cWhy was he ousted in that humiliating fashion? Why was he brought back from retirement the morning after the military takeover?\u201d he continued. \u201cThere is zero public discussion of these very serious questions.\u201d         \n\nGeneral Tohamy declined to be interviewed for this article and did not answer written questions. No court has evaluated the allegations against him. His accuser, Lt. Col. Moatassem Fathi, a police officer, has also declined to be interviewed. In a television appearance last fall, he acknowledged that at one point he temporarily quit working for General Tohamy at the Administrative Oversight Authority, the main anticorruption watchdog. He was upset over a job transfer that he deemed punitive, and it could have left him with a grudge.         \n\nBut critics of General Tohamy say he was the quintessential Mubarak man, the handpicked guardian of the system of corruption and impunity that was a central grievance of the revolution of January 2011. And his swift and silent return, the critics say, signals a restoration of the old order after the military takeover.         \n\nYezid Sayigh, a researcher at the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut, Lebanon, who has written about the Administrative Oversight Authority, asked: \u201cOf all the qualified people in Egypt, why bring in Tohamy, who is way past his retirement age and under a cloud already? Why is this so urgent?\u201d         \n\nWestern officials who have met with General Tohamy and other leaders of the military-led government say he quickly distinguished himself as the most influential advocate of a crackdown.         \n\n\u201cHe was the most hard-line, the most absolutely unreformed,\u201d one Western diplomat said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss private meetings with General Tohamy. \u201cHe talked as if the revolution of 2011 had never even happened.\u201d         \n\nGeneral Sisi and the civilian ministers around him initially pledged to try to include Mr. Morsi\u2019s Islamist supporters in a new democratic process. For more than a month, General Sisi appeared to consider the arguments of former Vice President Mohamed ElBaradei and a few others urging restraint in the interest of reconciliation with the Islamists, who had camped out by the tens of thousands at sit-ins protesting the takeover.         \n\nBut within days of the takeover, General Tohamy was already arguing against any inclusion of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group that led the voting in elections for Parliament and the presidency. Its members were \u201cterrorists\u201d whose movement must be excluded and crushed, General Tohamy argued, according to the Western officials who met with him and with Egyptians in the new government.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/30/world/middleeast/ousted-general-in-egypt-is-back-as-islamists-foe.html", "date": "2013-10-30", "description": "Gen.
