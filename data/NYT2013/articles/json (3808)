{"headline": "What\u2019s Behind the Notion That Nonfiction Is More \u2018Relevant\u2019 Than Fiction?", "body": "\nEach week in Bookends, two writers take on pressing and provocative questions about the world of books. This week, Rivka Galchen and Pankaj Mishra discuss the boundaries of fiction and nonfiction, and the way each form reflects the world in which we live.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \nRivka Galchen \n\nNonfiction generally has the lead over fiction in being true: on having a substantial glitter of one-to-one correspondences to verifiable details of what we fairly and efficiently term the \u201creal world.\u201d This may be the force behind the notion that nonfiction is the more relevant of the two. Sometimes the relevance concerns a trend of babies wearing overalls made out of watermelons, and sometimes it relates to an understanding of civil forfeiture in the American justice system, but either way, nonfiction is, basically, more true and more relevant, more or less.         \n\nBut of course fiction also claims to be true. In Mary Shelley\u2019s preface to \u201cFrankenstein\u201d (a preface that turns out to have been ghostwritten for her by Percy Bysshe Shelley), she (or he) says of her tale of the monster jolted to life by electricity, \u201cHowever impossible as a physical fact,\u201d it \u201caffords a point of view . . . for the delineating of human passions more comprehensive and commanding than any which the ordinary relations of existing events can yield.\u201d She (or he) adds, \u201cI have thus endeavoured to preserve the truth of the elementary principles of human nature, while I have not scrupled to innovate upon their combinations.\u201d         \n\nFiction, the argument follows, can be true in the same way \u201cIf\u201d statements are true. If I collide two hydrogen atoms just so, then . . . there will be an explosion. Or, If a man awakens to discover himself turned into a monstrous insect, then. . . . As Marianne Moore said of poets, a fiction writer aims to make \u201cimaginary gardens with real toads in them.\u201d         \n\nThat most fiction arguably fails at this is just a practical definition of \u201cmost,\u201d and a parallel of the fact that most journalism, also, is good enough only for the \u201cjour\u201d \u2014 the day. When Ezra Pound observed of literature that it is \u201cnews that stays news,\u201d he was excluding a majority of nonfiction and fiction, and also admitting a measure of each.         \n\nBut fiction and nonfiction do tend to deploy different methods for getting to the truth. Fiction, we have been told, tells the truth but tells it slant. It familiarizes the strange and estranges the familiar. Nonfiction aims, if not exclusively and not uncomplicatedly, for Orwell\u2019s model of the clear pane of glass.         \n\nIn that case: Is there something about our present moment \u2014 the Internet! late capitalism! the death of reading! the overuse of exclamation points! \u2014 that makes the methods of nonfiction consistently yield more truth than those of fiction? Was there an ideal era for epic poetry, and are we now in the epoch fated for fact-checked tweets? Maybe.         \n\nBut I suspect it is the techniques of fiction, also often used by nonfiction writers, that are especially valuable now. I say this because it\u2019s possible that we as a culture suffer from a particularly debilitating case of thinking we know much more than we know. (A statement with a grammatical subject as broad as \u201cwe as a culture\u201d has acquired a lot of inaccuracy and even profound wrongness before it reaches its predicate \u2014 and we as a culture seem more drawn than ever to these sorts of broad pronouncements.)         \n\nThis false sense of knowing \u2014 not a new problem, but perhaps a newly pressing one \u2014 has been made worse by the ease with which we find Web sites devoted to telling us what we already want to hear and already suspect is true. There are even algorithms for this; confirmation bias has never been more pervasive or insidious. We inhabit fanciful castles of facts.         \n\nMostly we read the nonfiction that suits our fancy, and tend to ignore that which does not. Not for aphoristic economy alone did Nietzsche observe that convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth than lies. Because we are less sure of what fiction is \u201csaying,\u201d we are less pre-emptively defended against it or biased in its favor. We are inclined to let it past our fortifications. It\u2019s merely a court jester, there to amuse us. We let in the brazen liar and his hidden, difficult truths.         \n\n \n         \n\n\u25c6 \u25c6 \u25c6         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \nPankaj Mishra", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/27/books/review/whats-behind-the-notion-that-nonfiction-is-more-relevant-than-fiction.html", "date": "2013-10-22", "description": "Rivka Galchen and Pankaj Mishra discuss the boundaries of fiction and nonfiction, and the way each form reflects the world in which we live."}
