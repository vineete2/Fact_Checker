{"headline": "G.O.P. Rifts Lead Congress to Spending Impasse", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Hours before leaving on summer recess, Congress on Thursday hit a seemingly intractable impasse on government spending, increasing the prospects of a government shutdown in the fall and adding new urgency to fiscal negotiations between the White House and a bloc of Senate Republicans.         \n\nThe group of eight lawmakers headed to the White House to find a way forward after Senate Republicans filibustered a housing and transportation spending measure, saying it violated a spending deal struck two years ago. The blockade of the Senate bill came after House Republican leaders on Wednesday gave up on a more austere version of the bill when moderate Republicans balked and said the cuts in the House measure were too deep.         \n\nFor more than two and a half hours, the group met with the White House chief of staff, Denis R. McDonough, senior budget officials and, for nearly an hour, with President Obama. They emerged to say they would meet again at least once during the August recess.         \n\nSenator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, said the president pressed the group to aim for a deficit-reduction deal that would be larger than simply replacing the across-the-board spending cuts known as sequester with savings elsewhere in the budget.         \n\n\u201cEach time we meet there\u2019s a little more clarity,\u201d Mr. Corker said. But he warned, \u201cNobody should get overly excited.\u201d         \n\nThe collapse of the spending measures on both sides of the Capitol left leaders of both parties pointing fingers and a resolution up in the air until the House and Senate return after a five-week break.         \n\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t recognize the reality of those failures, then we\u2019ve got big problems,\u201d said Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia, the unofficial leader of the Senate Republican negotiators.         \n\nRepresentative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 House Democrat, was pessimistic about avoiding another fiscal crisis in the fall.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult, dark path ahead, dark to the extent that I can\u2019t tell you what the alternative is,\u201d he said.         \n\nCongress appeared at a dead end, unable to pass spending bills at the levels mandated by the across-the-board spending cuts, but unwilling to retreat to higher numbers set by the 2011 Budget Control Act before those cuts went into force.         \n\nNo one suggested a breakthrough was imminent, though Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the new White House budget director, said the rift within the Republican Party could be an opening for compromise. Large sections of the government will shut down on Oct. 1 unless Congress can find accommodation on new spending measures, and lawmakers will have little time to do so when they return on Sept. 9.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a $16 trillion debt,\u201d said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader. \u201cWe\u2019re spending hundreds of billions of dollars a year we don\u2019t have. This is how you get Greece. This is how you get Detroit. So we can\u2019t do this.\u201d         \n\nSpeaker John A. Boehner said he had no intention of retreating from the spending levels set by the sequester, and insisted that in September, Republican leaders would find the votes to pass spending bills at that level. \u201cI\u2019m sure our August recess will have our members in a better mood when they come back,\u201d he said.         \n\nOther Republicans said the struggle would only get harder. Facing another rebellion, the House Appropriations Committee on Wednesday set aside the formal drafting of an interior and environmental program spending bill that would have cut the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s budget to $5.5 billion from $8.3 billion, slashed clean-water grants by 83 percent, and cut the national endowments for the arts and humanities by 49 percent.         \n\nThe final domestic bill, which finances labor, health and education programs, would have the deepest cuts of all.         \n\nModerate Republicans from the Northeast have found such cuts impossible to swallow, and when their numbers were combined with ardent conservatives who never support appropriations bills, leaders have found themselves short by dozens of votes. Representative Jim Gerlach, Republican of Pennsylvania, said he could not accept Amtrak cuts, which would have reduced rail financing by one-third, and cuts to Community Development Block Grants below the level set when the program began under President Gerald R. Ford.
