{"headline": "Will New York\u2019s Casino Plan Really Work?", "body": "\nAs I walked down the main drag in Ellenville, N.Y., a small town about halfway between Manhattan and Albany, I noticed that if you turn your head at the proper angle, at the right time of day, at just the right intersection, the future doesn\u2019t seem so scary. Right where Hermance Street runs into Canal, there\u2019s the Shadowland Theater, a beautifully restored vaudeville house that abuts Aroma Thyme Bistro, which has four stars on Yelp. Off in the distance is the lush Witch\u2019s Hole State Forest and the valley around Rondout Creek.         \n\nBut if you lower your gaze a little or look just over your shoulder, another reality sets in fast. Canal Street is littered with abandoned storefronts. One block over, almost all the shops were torn down in a federal urban-renewal project. And because nothing ever replaced them, all you see are a lot of empty parking lots without much worth visiting. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of parking,\u201d Mary Sheeley, the village manager, told me.         \n\nLike many small towns in New York\u2019s borscht belt, Ellenville was fairly prosperous throughout the 20th century. The town had a factory for Channel Master, a leader in TV antennas, and the Nevele, a classic Catskills resort. These days, though, nearly half of Ellenville\u2019s adults don\u2019t work. Channel Master closed in the 1980s. Imperial Schrade Cutlery, which took over the factory, closed in 2004. The Nevele also closed that decade. The average income in town is now just over $19,000 a year.         \n\nBut Ellenville just got some hope. Last month, the New York State Legislature and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo agreed on a deal to give the town a shot at one of the state\u2019s four new proposed casinos. (A referendum is expected to be held in November.) As I was walking up Center Street, I couldn\u2019t help wondering if this town had what it took to host a casino. Or if a casino could really persuade people to spend their money in Ellenville and turn around its moribund economy. But Michael Treanor, the current owner of the Nevele, who runs the company that is hoping to get the state\u2019s gaming license, told me that that wasn\u2019t the right way to look at it. \u201cOur ability to do business is based upon a  \n of casinos,\u201d he told me. If the state allowed a dozen casinos to break ground, Ellenville would be toast. \u201cWe would never be able to build something luxurious enough to draw people,\u201d he said. With only four casinos spread out over the entire state, though, whoever got a license could thrive.         \n\nWhatever you think of gambling, its regulations are mesmerizing. Gambling is outlawed in one way or another in all 50 states, but almost all \u2014 except Hawaii (surprisingly) and Utah (less so) \u2014 have exceptions. Most offer state-run lotteries. Thirty allow Indian casinos. Seventeen have full-scale non-Indian casinos (New York and Massachusetts are poised to join that group.) In each case, government officials limit the number of casinos and determine where they will be located.         \n\nEconomically speaking, these anticasino regulations are the single greatest profit generator for casino operators. By limiting the number and location, and therefore artificially keeping the market underserved, governments essentially guarantee outsize profits for those in business. (The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, which limits cab licenses, ensures a similar regulatory oligopoly, as do many state liquor-distribution regulators.) If there were unlimited licenses, each casino operator would have to compete \u2014 like every restaurant or movie theater \u2014 with all the others. There might be some large resortlike casinos, along with boutique outfits catering to different sorts of markets; many would have to spend more upgrading their rooms; others would invest in more affordable high-end dining, and so forth. But all of them would have to compete harder to find a profitable niche, and, like pretty much all other businesses, some would fail in the process. Limited licenses, however, enable casino operators to profit without having to look over their shoulders. They also give operators the incentive to build the largest operations they possibly can. The big, sprawling, gaudy casinos that we\u2019ve become accustomed to are less a response to what consumers want than they are to the unrivaled opportunity afforded by regulations.         \n\nGiven the fact that casinos don\u2019t really operate in the free market, it\u2019s hard to discern whether or not these sprawling places actually benefit their surrounding areas, even depressed ones like Ellenville. Pro-gambling groups often cite data showing that casinos can revitalize broken economies and bring a fortune in tax revenue to the state. Antigambling groups argue that casinos turn communities into the stuff of country-music songs \u2014 rife with broken homes, car accidents and prostitution \u2014 and make them less desirable.
