{"headline": "In Review of Brooklyn Cases, So Many Obstacles", "body": "\nTo determine whether Shabaka Shakur was wrongfully convicted of double-murder almost 25 years ago, investigators need to locate an elusive eyewitness, a parolee with a history of substance abuse whom nobody has been able to find.         \n\nFor James Jenkins to be exonerated in the 1986 killing he insists he had nothing to do with, four people would have to say they lied under oath, and a sealed court file would have to reveal a paper trail of prosecutorial misconduct that led to his conviction.         \n\nAnd for Robert Hill to win release from his cell at the Fishkill Correctional Facility, prosecutors would have to reconcile why he told a parole board that he was remorseful for a murder he now swears he did not commit.         \n\nThose are just a sampling of the complications facing the Brooklyn district attorney\u2019s office as it begins an unprecedented review of 50 homicide convictions originally investigated by a single discredited police detective, Louis Scarcella.         \n\nProsecutors, detectives, defense lawyers and their private investigators will spend the coming months combing through yellowing files and jogging faded memories trying to find clues that could answer the question that has shaken the Brooklyn criminal justice system: Did a rogue detective put men in prison for murders they did not commit?         \n\nCases will essentially be investigated from scratch, with the added impediments brought by the passage of time, like dead witnesses and foggy recollections. Convictions that relied on disputed confessions or the word of a single drug addict will be viewed under a modern lens, and could collapse under today\u2019s dependence on forensics.         \n\nThe inquest is so sweeping and spans so many years that it has prompted accusations that it is really a re-election tactic for District Attorney  \n, who has been dogged by a string of wrongful convictions.         \n\n\u201cOpening 50 cases is a herculean task,\u201d said Pierre Sussman, a defense lawyer who represents two of the men whose cases will be reviewed. \u201cThe first challenge will be culling information from files that are two or three decades old and trying to find witnesses who were hard to find even then. These are not people with bank accounts, library cards and Facebook pages.\u201d         \n\nMr. Hynes\u2019s office announced this month that his agency\u2019s Conviction Integrity Unit would review about four dozen murder convictions \u2014 all cases that were investigated by Mr. Scarcella, a detective who worked Brooklyn streets from 1973 until his retirement in 1999, time that included the dark days when crack cocaine destroyed entire families and neighborhoods and the police were ill equipped to stop the crush of violence.         \n\nThough it had long raised red flags inside the courthouse, Mr. Scarcella\u2019s work was first questioned publicly in March, when prosecutors agreed to release David Ranta, who was jailed for 23 years for a murder he most likely did not commit. A six-month review by Mr. Hynes\u2019s office showed that Mr. Scarcella told a witness in the case to pick from a lineup the guy with the big nose and rewarded other people who agreed to testify by letting them out of jail to visit prostitutes. Even the judge questioned the circumstances of a confession that Mr. Scarcella said he transcribed by hand, and for which he had no notes.         \n\nIt appears that the problems extended far beyond that single case.  \n by The New York Times revealed questionable patterns, including his use of the same drug addict time and time again to testify as an eyewitness in his cases. Mr. Scarcella said he never framed any suspects or rigged any cases.         \n\nThe Conviction Integrity Unit, led by a longtime prosecutor, John O\u2019Mara, already had 14 unrelated cases under review when Mr. Ranta was released in March, said Jerry Schmetterer, a spokesman for Mr. Hynes. Now that the caseload has quadrupled, several experienced homicide attorneys have been asked to review Mr. Scarcella\u2019s cases, Mr. Schmetterer said.         \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going to be most time-consuming is getting files out of the municipal archives or our own archives,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are hard at work identifying the attorneys to conduct the review. The D.A. has said O\u2019Mara will get whatever he needs.\u201d (Mr. O\u2019Mara said cases that relied on a single eyewitness or a confession would get the closest look.)
