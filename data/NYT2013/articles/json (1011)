{"headline": "An Office Romance That Just Clicked", "body": "\n \n         \n\nFred and Michele Yeadon met as co-workers in 1981 and married on Sept. 22, 1984, in Chicago, where he is a software engineer. She does volunteer work and is on the advisory board for Black Creativity with the Museum of Science and Industry. The couple has an adult son. A condensed and edited version of our conversation follows.         \n\n \n         \n\nMichele: The Arthur Andersen accounting firm. I was in administration and Fred was an information systems consultant. The first time I realized I liked him he had said something about how I might look nice with contact lenses, and I took my glasses off for him. It was out of character for me and later realized, oh, I was flirting.         \n\nFred: It was an office romance. I was on assignment at the Chicago branch of the firm, but lived in New York. I found her very attractive and we had a good vibe. I had tickets to a concert and was going to go with someone else and when they couldn\u2019t make it I realized that I would rather take Michele.         \n\nMichele: He asked me to go out while we were on our way out the door. I didn\u2019t quite think of it as a date, but when I was waiting in front of the orchestra hall and saw him coming toward me, it was the first time I had seen him in casual clothes and I thought he was kind of cute.         \n\n \n         \n\nFred: Within the first few minutes we clicked. It felt like we had known each other for years. I was nervous but thrilled to be out with her. I did give her a good night kiss, which I think was the first hint to her that it wasn\u2019t platonic. I did not want to get myself into the \u201cfriend zone.\u201d         \n\nMichele: Talking at intermission we realized we had so much in common. We had both been abroad in Italy; his father was a bank executive and so was my mother. His parents were from Iowa and so is my father. We didn\u2019t do anything romantic for months after that, though.         \n\n \n         \n\nMichele: It had to do with the fact that it was an interracial relationship. It was still sort of a taboo and though intellectually I didn\u2019t think it was, emotionally I thought we had to be just friends. I don\u2019t think he thought it was a factor at all though.         \n\nFred: There was a no fraternization policy in the office, and for the first six months the relationship was ambiguous. A lot of our dates were just walking around Chicago. It wasn\u2019t mutual commitment from the start, but I kept finding ways to get to Chicago. After a while I think she just realized we were serious.         \n\n \n         \n\nFred: I don\u2019t think it affected the one-on-one relationship, but it affected the way we viewed the way the rest of the world would look at it. We were not interested in advertising it; I am private but I think she was more sensitive to social pressures. In the black community to date a white person in many circles was seen as selling out.         \n\nMichele: When we were just friendly I never noticed how people perceived us on the street, but once I started to pay attention to other people\u2019s reactions, that\u2019s how I knew we had crossed the threshold to being in a relationship. He never noticed anything. I would say, \u201cDid you see that look?\u201d and he hadn\u2019t.         \n\n \n         \n\nMichele: Very accepting. If they had a hard time we never knew. The thing is that in Bizarro world we could have been next-door neighbors, but because of the era it wasn\u2019t likely. But we came from very similar economic backgrounds.         \n\nFred: I grew up in Vermont and didn\u2019t know people of color. Until we were serious I didn\u2019t give my family a second thought, but later, I did want their approval. Their concern was that life might be harder for our kids, and us but in the end while we have a biracial marriage, it really isn\u2019t bicultural. In many ways I married the girl next door.         \n\n \n         \n\nMichele: We tease my mom that she treats Fred better than she treats the family. I thought my father would have a hard time but if he did he never voiced it. My uncle, who\u2019d fought in Korea married a Korean woman. And my great-grandfather, who was very fair, had German and English ancestry.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/13/booming/an-office-romance-that-just-clicked.html", "date": "2013-12-13", "description": "Michele and Fred Yeadon met as co-workers but didn\u2019t let his job in another city, or their different races, stop their relationship."}
