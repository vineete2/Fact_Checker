{"headline": "The Met Will Return a Pair of Statues to Cambodia", "body": "\nSix weeks ago the Metropolitan Museum of Art sent two of its top executives to Cambodia to resolve a thorny dispute: whether two pieces of ancient Khmer art that the museum has long prominently exhibited were the product of looting.         \n\nIn days they had their answer. Cambodian officials documented that the two 10th-century Khmer statues, donated to the Met in four pieces as separate gifts between 1987 and 1992, had indeed been smuggled out of a remote jungle temple around the time of the country\u2019s civil war in the 1970s.         \n\nOn Friday the museum said it would repatriate the life-size sandstone masterworks, known as the Kneeling Attendants, which have guarded the doorway to the Met\u2019s Southeast Asian galleries since they opened in 1994.         \n\nThe decision came after months of behind-the-scenes contact between the Met and Cambodian officials. Thomas P. Campbell, the museum\u2019s director, said the decision \u2014 one of the more significant in a recent spate of controversial repatriations by American museums \u2014 came after the Cambodians offered evidence that the works had been improperly removed from the  \n, 180 miles northwest of Phnom Penh.         \n\nAmong the evidence the officials considered were photographs of the statue\u2019s broken-off bases, which were left behind at the site, and witness statements that the Cambodians have collected suggesting that the statues were intact as recently as 1970.         \n\n\u201cThis is a case in which additional information regarding the Kneeling Attendants has led the museum to consider facts that were not known at the time of the acquisition and to take the action we are announcing today,\u201d Mr. Campbell said in a statement.         \n\nNo timetable has been set. The museum told Cambodian officials in a letter last month that it hoped to send the objects as soon as \u201cappropriate arrangements for transit can be mutually established.\u201d         \n\nThe Met\u2019s decision reflects the growing sensitivity by American museums to claims by foreign countries for the return of their cultural artifacts. Many items that have long been displayed in museums do not have precise paperwork showing how the pieces left their countries of origin. In recent years, at the urging of the Association of Art Museum Directors and scholars, many museums have applied more rigorous standards to their acquisitions.         \n\nAt the time the statues came to the Met in four pieces \u2014 two torsos and two heads \u2014 the Met and the museum world allowed acquisitions without detailed histories, although an effort was supposed to be made to examine an object\u2019s origin in case it was illicit.         \n\nIn an interview from Cambodia, Chan Tani, the secretary of state with the nation\u2019s Office of the Council of Ministers, expressed excitement about the return.         \n\n\u201cThis shows the high ethical standards and professional practices of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which they are known for,\u201d he said.         \n\nCambodian officials also visited the Met in March to photograph its Khmer items. A government official said that Cambodia would like the museum to review the provenance of another two dozen objects.         \n\nThe Met has developed a collaborative relationship with the country and is now exhibiting 10 sculptural works by the contemporary Cambodian artist  \n. The museum is also hoping to hold a major exhibition of Khmer artifacts next year.         \n\nThe negotiations over the statues, which began last June, culminated with the trip by Sharon Cott, the Met\u2019s general counsel, and John Guy, its Southeast Asian curator, to Cambodia in March.         \n\n\u201cAs a matter of courtesy, they wanted to go there rather than communicate by e-mail,\u201d said Harold Holzer, the Met\u2019s senior vice president for external affairs.         \n\nAmong the evidence cited by the Cambodians was the finding of the statues\u2019 broken-off bases still at the temple. That discovery is significant, according to Cambodian officials, who say archaeologists have evidence showing that other statues from the same grouping as the twins remained in place as late as 1970, only to disappear by 1975.         \n\nAnother object that was once part of the same grouping is a huge  \n of a warrior, known as Duryodhana, which Sotheby\u2019s had hoped to sell in 2011 for $3 million on behalf of its Belgian owner.         \n\nCambodia says that statue was also looted. United States officials have filed suit in federal court in Manhattan to confiscate the statue on Cambodia\u2019s behalf. The trial is expected to start later this year.         \n\nSotheby\u2019s has said it applied all appropriate standards of provenance research before agreeing to sell the statue. Asked on Friday what impact the Met\u2019s decision might have on the court case, Sotheby\u2019s replied in a statement that: \u201cThe Met\u2019s voluntary agreement does not shed any light on the key issues in our case.\u201d The auction house says that the consignor bought the statue in good faith in 1975 and that it had no knowledge of Cambodia\u2019s claim of ownership.
