{"headline": "Go Deeper Into Mexico With Mezcal", "body": "\nMezcal, tequila\u2019s brash, more rustic cousin, is crashing the cocktail party, showing up in the kind of mixed drinks normally made with more-refined spirits.         \n\nUntil fairly recently, mezcal was an esoteric choice, but it is becoming more mainstream as drinkers come to appreciate how it gives smoke and swagger to a drink, never retreating to the background no matter how much fruit juice and sugar are piled into the mix.         \n\nEven in a margarita, like the one they make at  \n in NoHo, it adds the kind of complexity and intrigue that is often lacking when the cocktail is made with many of today\u2019s overrefined tequilas.         \n\nFor those who are new to the spirit, a margarita is a sensible place to start. \u201cEveryone is familiar with a margarita, and it\u2019s a good way to showcase mezcal,\u201d said Ethan Smith, an owner and the mixologist at the restaurant Hecho en Dumbo.         \n\nBrian Van Flandern of  \n has come up with a drink that suggests a margarita, and could serve as a set of training wheels. It\u2019s called the Smoking Jacket, and includes both mezcal and tequila. You can adjust the proportions of either spirit depending on how much mezcal personality you want.         \n\n\u201cMezcal has real flavor, and it\u2019s much more terroir-driven,\u201d Mr. Van Flandern said.         \n\nBoth mezcal and tequila are made from agave, a succulent plant. But unlike tequila, the best of which is made with 100 percent blue agave, mezcal can be made from any of nearly 30 types of agave. The pi\u00f1as, or cores, are usually smoked in open pits, not steamed as for tequila.         \n\nIn his new book, \u201cCraft Cocktails,\u201d Mr. Van Flandern offers several mezcal concoctions, including the Rum and Smoke, in which he ramps up the smokiness with a splash of Lagavulin Scotch. Mezcal partners well with whiskey, especially Scotch and blended spirits. And certain fruits, notably orange and pineapple, seem tailor-made for it. A whiff of heat, from either pepper or chile, is not a mistake, either.         \n\nAnd don\u2019t think of these drinks as just a pairing for a plate of tacos, tamales or queso fundido. At  \n \u2014 a Bridgehampton, N.Y., restaurant that emphasizes local food and nods toward Asia, not Mexico \u2014 the mixologist, Douglas Sheehan, combines reposado mezcal with fresh pineapple juice, honey, chile and lime. His finishing touch is a dusting of crushed pink peppercorns that add fruit and fire to the well-balanced cocktail. He calls it They Didn\u2019t Burn Rome in a Day.
