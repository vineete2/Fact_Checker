{"headline": "How I Became a Hipster", "body": "\nYou know you\u2019re in hipster Brooklyn when someone who looks like a 19th-century farmer tells you that his line of work is \u201caffinity marketing.\u201d         \n\nI had fallen into conversation with the affinity marketer (beard, plaid flannel shirt, vintage work boots) in the lobby of the Wythe hotel in Williamsburg, a beehive of instrument-bearing musicians, nose-pierced locals and twentysomethings who use the word \u201cridiculous\u201d in nonpejorative contexts. I guessed aloud, \u201cSo, like, if I buy a pair of shoes, then you\u2019ll try to sell me socks?\u201d The affinity marketer smiled and said: \u201cOr maybe something bigger, like flooring. You buy a pair of shoes, I sell you reclaimed hardwood flooring.\u201d         \n\nO, bohemia! There are several ways to react to a culture quake. You can meet it with befuddlement, perhaps wondering how flappers handled the thorny intersection between dancing in fountains and limited dry-cleaning.         \n\nYou can put it on a pedestal by bringing undue optimism to the prospect of meeting Ernest Hemingway or some other expat after his seventh Pernod.         \n\nBut maybe there\u2019s another way \u2014 which is why, in early April, this middle-aged avowed Manhattanite checked into the Wythe and spent a long weekend trying to educate himself, canvassing Kings County\u2019s artisan-loving, kale-devouring epicenter. \u201cBrooklyn\u201d is now a byword for cool from Paris to Sweden to the Middle East. It\u2019s been strange to live across the river from a place that suddenly becomes a cultural reference point \u2014 not unlike having your dachshund become an overnight celebrity. Part of you wonders, Why him and not Aunt Barbara?         \n\nSo I decided to embed myself among the rooftop gardeners and the sustainability consultants and the chickeneers. I wanted to see what the demographic behind nanobatched chervil and the continually cited show \u201cGirls\u201d could teach me about life and craft cocktails. I wanted to see what sullen 25-year-old men had to tell me beyond \u201cLeave me alone during this awkward period of beard growth.\u201d         \n\nFirst I needed to outfit myself. H. W. Carter and Sons in Williamsburg is full of flannel and cardigans and work boots for the younger set. When a scruffy, ponytailed salesman in his 20s approached, I told him: \u201cI\u2019m going for a Mumford & Sons look. I want to look like I play the banjo.\u201d         \n\nThe sweet-tempered salesman helped me try on several field jackets, including an olive green London Fog, while a second equally sweet and solicitous young salesman (this one in a wool cap) helped me try on selvage denim jeans and a big, lumpy wool cardigan that looked like a lamb had died on me. He also showed me a $225 short-sleeve, plaid, navy jacquard shirt, which I decided to buy. While waiting at the cash register, I picked up a pair of argyle wool socks from a nearby wicker basket and asked, \u201cAre your socks local?\u201d The salesman self-consciously said no. I returned the socks like an organic farmer who has learned that a friend has named her child Monsanto.         \n\nHitting the street and other stores, I fleshed out my purchase with a snug-fitting corduroy vest and a wide-lapel vintage shirt (both $8) from Vice Versa, a thrift shop on Bedford Avenue, and a $10 vintage burgundy blazer (label: Hob Nob, by Irwin) from the Mobile Vintage Shop, a trailer I found parked in Bushwick. When I layered the corduroy shirt over the H. W. Carter shirt, the effect was homespun and slightly raffish: a country-store clerk who has lost his spectacles in the barley.         \n\nI walked down Bedford Avenue, a veritable ocean of beard. Realizing that I\u2019ve never been shaved with a straight razor before, I showed up at Barber and Supply, a cavernous salon in a former garage in Williamsburg. I told my barber, Rich, a hirsute Mediterranean-looking man with studs in each ear, that I was anxious about the \u201cSweeney Todd aspect\u201d of a straight razor. My anxiety was for naught.
