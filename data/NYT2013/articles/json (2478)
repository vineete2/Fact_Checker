{"headline": "Petition Wants Met Gala Dedicated to Gay Rights", "body": "\nThe furor over  \n placing restrictions on the discussion of homosexuality has spread to the world of classical music, with some opera fans calling on the Metropolitan Opera to dedicate its opening-night gala performance of Tchaikovsky\u2019s \u201cEugene Onegin\u201d to the support of gay people.         \n\nThe long-planned new  \n of \u201cEugene Onegin,\u201d which will open the Met season on Sept. 23, is to be conducted by Valery Gergiev, the artistic director of the Mariinsky Theater in St. Petersburg and one of the foremost interpreters of the Russian repertory, and to star Anna Netrebko, the popular Russian diva, who will be opening the Met\u2019s season for the third year in a row. Both were vocal supporters of the 2012 campaign of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who in June signed the law banning \u201cpropaganda on nontraditional sexual relationships.\u201d         \n\nAn  \n, referring to what the organizer calls \u201cPutin\u2019s recent laws against homosexual people and those who support them\u201d and to Tchaikovsky\u2019s suffering because of his homosexuality, is calling on the Met to dedicate its Russian-theme opening night to the support of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered people. \u201cI\u2019m not asking them to be against anybody,\u201d said Andrew Rudin,  \n who started the petition. \u201cI\u2019m asking them to be for somebody.\u201d         \n\nThe initial response was small by the standards of online activism. While  \n asking the White House to \u201cbegin construction of a Death Star by 2016\u201d has gathered some 34,000 signatures, Mr. Rudin\u2019s opera petition had received only about 2,200 signatures by Monday \u2014 not enough people even to fill the opera house, which can hold nearly 4,000. But it spurred an impassioned online debate about the role of art in politics and the responsibilities of artists.         \n\nAnd it attracted the signature of Bartlett Sher, the director of several critically acclaimed recent productions for the Met, including Offenbach\u2019s \u201cContes d\u2019Hoffmann\u201d and Donizetti\u2019s \u201cElisir d\u2019Amore,\u201d both of which starred Ms. Netrebko.         \n\nMr. Sher said in an interview that he did not see the petition as anti-Met but rather as a chance to take a stand against Mr. Putin and the recent law. \u201cI saw it as a chance for everyone who loves opera, and all of us who work in it, to stand up to a pig and a dictator, against a terrible position and a terrible man,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe Met\u2019s general manager, Peter Gelb, responded to the petition with a statement saying that the Met was proud of its history as a creative base for gay and lesbian singers, conductors, directors, designers and choreographers and adding that \u201cwe also stand behind all of our artists, regardless of whether or not they wish to publicly express their personal political opinions.\u201d         \n\n\u201cAs an institution, the Met deplores the suppression of equal rights here or abroad,\u201d the statement said. \u201cBut since our mission is artistic, it is not appropriate for our performances to be used by us for political purposes, no matter how noble or right the cause.\u201d         \n\nAsked about the Met\u2019s response, Mr. Sher said that he supported the Met \u201cin every way, as well as Anna.\u201d         \n\nMs. Netrebko said in  \n this month: \u201cAs an artist, it is my great joy to collaborate with all of my wonderful colleagues \u2014 regardless of their race, ethnicity, religion, gender, or sexual orientation. I have never and will never discriminate against anyone.\u201d         \n\nA spokesman for Ms. Netrebko, Sean Michael Gross, said that the singer would let the statement speak for itself. \u201cI think it\u2019s preposterous to presume that anyone who endorses a candidate for public office agrees \u2014 or disagrees \u2014 with their public policy positions 100 percent once they\u2019re in office,\u201d he said.         \n\nA representative of Mr. Gergiev \u2014 who was honored by Mr. Putin this spring with a revived Soviet-era title, Hero of Labor, around the time he opened a  \n, the Mariinsky II \u2014 did not return a call seeking comment.         \n\nIn Europe, Russia\u2019s freedoms and human rights record will be the focus of a concert that Gidon Kremer, the Latvian-born violinist and the founder of the Kremerata Baltica chamber orchestra, plans to hold in Berlin on Oct. 7 \u2014 the anniversary of the death of  \n, a Russian journalist and critic of the Kremlin who was killed in 2006.         \n\nMr. Kremer said in an e-mail interview that his concert, which was in the works before the recent laws on homosexuality were passed, was intended as \u201ca kind of a personal statement against injustice,\u201d and took issue with descriptions of the concert as an \u201canti-Putin\u201d event.         \n\n\u201cI had my chance to spend my childhood in an authoritarian country,\u201d Mr. Kremer said. \u201cThe trends Russia is heading in now make me worry and reminds me of those times.\u201d         \n\nAsked about the situation at the Met, he said: \u201cI myself am not denying the obvious high artistic qualities of Anna Netrebko or Valery Gergiev, but I do feel a certain discomfort observing them offstage. The identification with one\u2019s own country is more than honorable and understandable. Never would I criticize a real patriot nor deny that patriotism is a very natural attitude. We all should be able to love our native country.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWhat makes me feel odd is the way these feelings are presented,\u201d he said, \u201cthe way artists become spokesmen for politicians and those who are in power.\u201d         \n\nMr. Gelb said that he believed the focus on the Met was misplaced. \u201cWhat seems to be somewhat unfair about this petition is not its support of L.G.B.T. rights in Russia, but that they would choose the Met as a vehicle or target of their displeasure,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThe Met has been a champion of L.G.B.T. art, and it seems like they\u2019re barking up the wrong tree.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/20/arts/music/petition-wants-met-gala-dedicated-to-gay-rights.html", "date": "2013-08-19", "description": "An online petition calls for the Metropolitan Opera\u2019s Russian-theme gala, led by two supporters of President Vladimir V.
