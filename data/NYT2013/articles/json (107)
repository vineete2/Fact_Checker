{"headline": "Report Shows Better Outlook for Medicare", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The financial outlook for Medicare has improved because of a stronger economy and slower growth in health spending, and the financial condition of Social Security has not worsened but is still unsustainable, the Obama administration said Friday.         \n\n\u201cThe projections in this year\u2019s report for Social Security are essentially unchanged from last year, and those for Medicare have improved modestly,\u201d the Treasury secretary, Jacob J. Lew, said.         \n\nThe Medicare trustees \u2014 four federal officials and two public representatives \u2014 said in their annual report that the \u201cmodest improvement\u201d in the outlook for Medicare\u2019s long-term finances reflected lower projected spending for skilled nursing homes and private Medicare Advantage plans.         \n\nThe administration said the outlook for the Medicare trust fund was brighter because of the 2010 health care law. The law squeezed nearly $500 billion out of Medicare over 10 years, in part by trimming payments to many health care providers, including nursing homes and private health plans.         \n\nBut the number of Medicare beneficiaries will grow rapidly, to 73 million in 2025 from 52 million today, so paying for the program remains a huge challenge, administration officials said.         \n\nOlder Americans stand to benefit from the slower growth in health spending. The standard Medicare premium paid by most beneficiaries will probably stay at the current level, $104.90 a month, next year, the trustees said in their report.         \n\nUnder current law, the administration said, Medicare\u2019s hospital insurance trust fund will be exhausted in 2026, and the Social Security Trust Fund will be depleted in 2033. The administration said in its 2012 report that the Medicare trust fund would run out of money in 2024, and the Social Security fund in 2033.         \n\nThe trustees urged Congress to shore up the finances of both programs, but few lawmakers are clamoring for immediate action.         \n\nSocial Security provides benefits to more than 57 million people, and an average of about 10,000 baby boomers become eligible each day. Payroll taxes and other revenue dedicated to Social Security would be sufficient to pay about three-fourths of promised benefits when its trust fund runs out, administration officials said.         \n\nThe condition of the economy has improved in the past year, the government is collecting more revenue and the growth of health spending has slowed. Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, said that Medicare spending per beneficiary had risen at a rate of just 1.7 percent a year from 2010 to 2012. In the prior two decades, it rose more than 6 percent a year, on average.         \n\nOne of the public trustees, Robert D. Reischauer, said \u201cthere is reason to be quite optimistic\u201d that the slowdown in health spending will continue. One-third to half of the slowdown may be attributable to the recession and its aftermath, when people cut back on medical spending. But much of the remainder reflects efforts by insurers and health care providers to rein in costs, said Mr. Reischauer, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office.         \n\nThe trustees\u2019 reports are regarded as authoritative because they are produced with a minimum of political interference and incorporate the work of civil servants, including actuaries and economists who have been studying the programs for decades.         \n\nIn an appendix to the report, Paul Spitalnic, the acting chief actuary of Medicare, said that future costs could well be higher than indicated in the report. For example, current law would require a reduction of nearly 25 percent in Medicare payments to doctors next Jan. 1, \u201can implausible expectation,\u201d Mr. Spitalnic said, and he noted that Congress had usually stepped in to prevent such cuts.         \n\nFor many years, the growth of Medicare and of total national health spending has outstripped the growth of the economy.         \n\nThe latest report indicates that Medicare spending per beneficiary will grow more slowly than the economy \u2014 the per capita gross domestic product \u2014 through 2017. After that, the trustees expect Medicare to grow faster \u2014 about four-tenths of a percentage point more than the per capita G.D.P. in 2037, for example.         \n\nRepublicans and Democrats in Congress say that Medicare and Social Security are financially unsustainable in their current forms. But they are far from agreement on changes that may be needed.         \n\nThe two programs accounted for 37 percent of all federal spending last year, and the Congressional Budget Office estimates that, under current law, their share will grow to 42 percent by 2023.         \n\nAffluent Medicare beneficiaries already pay higher premiums \u2014 as much as $335.70 a month this year \u2014 and the trustees see this figure rising above $500 a month by 2022. As part of his budget, President Obama has proposed steeper increases for the most affluent.         \n\nMore than one in four Medicare beneficiaries \u2014 14.8 million people \u2014 are in private health plans, including Medicare Advantage plans offered by companies like UnitedHealth and Humana. Enrollment in such private plans has doubled in the last seven years. The trustees\u2019 report forecasts slower growth, with enrollment reaching 20 million in 2030.         \n\nThe Congressional Budget Office, by contrast, predicts more rapid growth, with enrollment in private plans reaching 21 million in 2023.         \n\nThe trustees expressed concern about the condition of Social Security\u2019s disability insurance program and the disability trust fund, which they said would be exhausted in 2016, the same year projected in the 2012 report.         \n\nIn the past, Congress has reallocated tax revenue from the retirement program to the disability trust fund. But Charles P. Blahous III, a public trustee, said that was not an ideal solution because the retirement program had financial problems of its own.
