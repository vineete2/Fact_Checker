{"headline": "New York\u2019s Top Recruit Selects Seton Hall", "body": "\nIn the sandy brick gymnasium at Abraham Lincoln High School, in Coney Island in Brooklyn, foldout chairs were laid out, and a podium was in place for an announcement by yet another basketball prodigy who had decided to leave home.         \n\nThere were blue and white balloons and streamers hanging from the lofted indoor track. \u201cI Made It\u201d by the rapper Kevin Rudolf blared on the sound system. A neon orange banner sent congratulations to Isaiah Whitehead, considered the top player in New York City.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu,\u201d said Dwayne Morton, Lincoln\u2019s coach.         \n\nLike Stephon Marbury, Sebastian Telfair and Lance Stephenson, three Lincoln stars before him, Whitehead chose to remove himself from New York City entirely \u2014 although Whitehead is not going far away. Quietly, if not timidly, he revealed that he would commit to Seton Hall, in South Orange, N.J.         \n\n\u201cI want to set my own path,\u201d Whitehead said.         \n\nThe 12th-best prospect in the country, according to Scout.com, Whitehead had whittled his choices to Indiana, Pittsburgh, Minnesota, Seton Hall and St. John\u2019s. A 6-foot-4 shooting guard, Whitehead said he came to the conclusion Wednesday night after an unofficial visit that day to the St. John\u2019s campus.         \n\n\u201cI picked Seton Hall to bring the program back to where it used to be,\u201d said Whitehead, who led Lincoln to the city championship this spring.         \n\nIt took only seconds before another neon orange banner was unfurled behind him as he spoke, this one spelling out, \u201cSeton Hall.\u201d Royal blue Pirates T-shirts were dispersed to Whitehead\u2019s teammates, and the cheerleading squad performed a jubilant routine.         \n\nWhitehead\u2019s mother, Ericka Rambert, dabbed away tears.         \n\n\u201cUp until last night, St. John\u2019s was up in his mind,\u201d Rambert said. \u201cEverybody was telling him, \u2018New York City, New York City, New York City.\u2019         \n\n\u201cBut I think sometimes you\u2019ve got to get a little bit away from home,\u201d Rambert added. \u201cHe needed to be someplace where he\u2019s going to be close to me, but he can\u2019t just get up and get on the train and go to the house.\u201d         \n\nFor months, Whitehead seemed destined for a place like Syracuse, Louisville, Arizona or U.C.L.A., top-flight programs that had all expressed sincere interest in him. Over the summer, that interest appeared to wane. St. John\u2019s met with Whitehead in April, but the Red Storm, already with six scholarship guards on its roster, had begun focusing its recruiting efforts elsewhere.         \n\nAccording to a person with knowledge of Whitehead\u2019s recruitment, St. John\u2019s would not offer Whitehead a guaranteed starting spot. Perhaps just as important, St. John\u2019s would not offer Morton a spot on its coaching staff.         \n\nMorton, a longtime city basketball power broker, did not exactly refute the reports that he would soon be joining  \n\u2019s bench, if not this season then next. He reiterated his desire to coach in college.         \n\n\u201cTristate area is my strength,\u201d Morton said, \u201cso help me out.\u201d         \n\nMorton acknowledged his heavy influence in Whitehead\u2019s recruitment. He said that Seton Hall had been quietly there all along and that, despite not making the N.C.A.A. tournament since 2006, the Pirates provided a blank slate for Whitehead to flourish.         \n\nBlue and white streamers fell from the ceiling, covering the audience, including the girls\u2019 volleyball team, which was trying to clear the court so it could practice. Then the cheerleaders began to clap and chant, and the noise interrupted Morton\u2019s impromptu news conference. He used the diversion to slip away, walking toward the back of the gym, behind the scenes.
