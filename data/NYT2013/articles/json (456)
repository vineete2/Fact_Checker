{"headline": "Mexico Pursuing Vanished Victims of Its Drug Wars", "body": "\nMONTERREY, Mexico \u2014 Rosa Gonz\u00e1lez cannot shake the memory of the state investigator who was too afraid of reprisals to take a full report, the police officer who shrugged when the ransom demand came, the months of agonizing doubt and, most of all, the final words from her daughter before she disappeared.         \n\n\u201cI am giving you a hug because I love you so much,\u201d her mentally disabled daughter, Brizeida, 23, told Rosa hours before she was abducted with her 21-year-old cousin after a party more than two years ago.         \n\nIn thousands upon thousands of cases, the story may well have ended there, adding to the vast number of Mexicans who have disappeared. Unlike those in other Latin American countries who were victims of repressive governments, many of Mexico\u2019s disappeared are casualties of the organized-crime and drug violence that has convulsed this nation for years.         \n\nBut here in Nuevo Le\u00f3n State, prosecutors, detectives, human rights workers and families are poring over cases together and in several instances cracking them, overcoming the thick walls of mistrust between civilians and the authorities to do the basic police work that is so often missing in this country, leaving countless crimes unsolved and unpunished.         \n\nAbout 26,000 missing-person reports sit in the federal government\u2019s database, everything from drug-related abductions to runaways, and the administration of President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto,  \n, has promised to do more to find out what happened.         \n\nOften, that would require the authorities to investigate themselves. This month, the national human rights commission said it was looking into 2,443 cases in which the police or military, corrupted by criminal gangs, appeared to be the abductors.         \n\nBut public pressure from victims\u2019 families and international groups has been mounting, repeatedly condemning the widespread failure to investigate the scourge of disappearances. After a series of protests by mothers of victims at the federal attorney general\u2019s office in Mexico City, it announced two weeks ago that a unit was being assembled to delve into the cases.         \n\n\u201cWe are not doing magic,\u201d the attorney general, Jes\u00fas Murillo Karam, told reporters at the announcement. \u201cWe are going to get as far as you can. We are going to exhaust all the options and speak with absolute truth about the possibility of results.\u201d         \n\nAdvocates for the victims remain skeptical, saying the real work needs to be done at the state and local level, where the cases are first reported and most investigators and leads reside.         \n\nHere in Nuevo Le\u00f3n, one of the states hardest hit by violence, they have praised the prosecutor\u2019s office for working with a local human rights group and family members to review several dozen cases, sometimes performing investigations that were never done in the first place.         \n\nAnother look at Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s case last year helped lead the police to a gang leader who was arrested in January. He confessed to abducting and killing the women, and directed the authorities to the remains of the cousin; further testing of bones at the site is under way to determine if any belong to Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s daughter. \u201cWhatever God may want,\u201d Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez said through tears, \u201cwhether my daughter is alive or dead, I am resigned to whatever may come.\u201d         \n\nSince agreeing in June 2011 to reopen dozens of cases, out of thousands here in the past several years, the authorities and their civilian counterparts have met monthly to go over leads and any progress made on them. Fifty-two cases have been resolved, with some people found dead and others alive, including 12 this year who were discovered to be in the custody of the authorities, unknown to their families. About 40 people have been arrested on abduction or homicide charges, 16 of them police officers.         \n\n\u201cNuevo Le\u00f3n is one of the only states where you see prosecutors actually doing the due diligence of conducting investigations, meeting with families, going to the crime scene, taking common-sense steps to advance the investigation,\u201d said Nik Steinberg, an investigator with Human Rights Watch, which in February published a damning report on the disappeared. \u201cTo search for the missing and find the people responsible for taking them, in Mexico where normally investigators don\u2019t do any of that, that is progress.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/23/world/americas/mexico-pursuing-vanished-victims-of-its-drug-wars.html", "date": "2013-06-22", "description": "In Nuevo Le\u00f3n State, the authorities are doing the basic police work that is so often missing in this country, leaving countless crimes unsolved and unpunished."}
