{"headline": "Who Made That Smoke Alarm?", "body": "\nIn the early 1960s, Duane Pearsall tinkered in his engineering lab with a machine he called a \u201cstatic neutralizer\u201d \u2014 an ion generator designed to control static electricity in factories and photo labs. But when one of his technicians lit up a cigarette, a meter measuring the ions went haywire. Pearsall realized he\u2019d just hit on a low-cost, low-power method for sniffing smoke. During the next decade, he and his team developed the SmokeGard, which hung from the ceiling and made a noxious noise whenever it sensed a fire. Soon, smoke detectors were in most homes\u00a0in America and had saved hundreds of lives. Yet they could also be irritating. \u201cYou have no way of knowing whether it\u2019s operational unless you set fire to your house,\u201d wrote one newspaper humorist in 1977 of a cheap smoke detector he bought in a local store. \u201cMerely holding the smoke detector in your lap while you watch Farrah Fawcett-Majors is not a true test.\u201d         \n\nYou can now push a button on smoke alarms to test whether they\u2019re working, but the button is usually out of reach. The plastic puck, so perversely hard to control, has inspired several anti-fan pages on Facebook. Hundreds of people shared their rage at the way when the battery runs low it would chirp merrily as you lay in bed wishing it would die. \u201cYou\u2019d hear it in the middle of the night: beep, beep,\u201d says Tony Fadell, an industrial designer known for his work at Apple on the iPod. \u201cThen the family comedy would ensue.\u201d In 2010, Fadell co-founded a company called Nest to take aim at what he calls the \u201cunloved object\u201d in our homes. The smoke detector struck him as an obvious target for redesign. Fadell and his team noted that people particularly resented the way smoke detectors bully us in the kitchen \u2014 it feels as if we\u2019re being shrieked at by an unreasonable husband or wife. \u201cYou\u2019re like, \u2018I\u2019m just burning the toast!\u2019 \u201d Fadell says. A new device had to be able to distinguish a wisp of smoke from a dangerous fire. In a nonemergency, it needed to tell you, \u201c \u2018Hey honey, I smell something,\u2019 \u201d he says. And so his Nest Protect alarm reacts to cooking smoke with a suitably low-key alert, saying, \u201cHeads up!\u201d in a woman\u2019s voice. To turn off the alarm, you wave your hand underneath it or control it with your phone. That, says Fadell, is like telling the machine, \u201cHoney, I got this.\u201d The Nest Protect has many moods, which it conveys with a blush of colored light: \u201cWhen it glows green, it\u2019s saying, \u2018Everything\u2019s working just fine.\u2019 If it glows yellow, you just wave at it, and it will say, \u2018Batteries are low,\u2019 \u201d according to Fadell.         \n\nBut this cheerful smoke detector costs almost 10 times as much as the cranky plastic disc you can pick up from the hardware store. And \u2014 heads up! \u2014 if you neglect its batteries, the Nest Protect will eventually start chirping in the night, just like all the others.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \nIn the aftermath of\u00a0Hurricane Sandy, my grandmother was heating her home with her gas stove, releasing dangerous amounts of carbon monoxide into the air. I wanted a device that would call her to explain the danger and would also warn me. Nothing like that exists, and so in May my friend and I built the prototype at the Big Apps hackathon in New York. We lit a fire underneath a circuit board, and then everyone in the audience who had signed up for our app got a phone call telling them there was an emergency. People were excited because they saw this idea could work. From there, the orders started rolling in.         \n\n \n\u00a0We thought it could do more. Of course it\u2019s there to detect smoke, but why not have it also sense everyday problems and make my life better? It should be able to detect particulate matter and tell you not only what\u2019s in your house, but also what\u2019s in the neighborhood and your city.         \n\n \nThings turned out O.K. for her. Once the lights came on, so did her heat.
