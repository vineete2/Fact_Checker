{"headline": "Newburgh, N.Y., Seeks Renewal Without Gentrification", "body": "\nNEWBURGH, N.Y. \u2014 As Hannah Brooks drove down Liberty Street, she felt the magnetic pull of this city 60 miles north of Manhattan, with its Hudson River views, its architectural masterpieces and its shocking decay. \u201cYou drive through these damaged areas and you find pockets of these amazing buildings,\u201d said\u00a0Ms. Brooks, who was at the time a resident of Fort Greene, Brooklyn. \u201cYou can see that they\u2019re crying out to be saved.\u201d         \n\nShe decided to do just that. Ms. Brooks joined dozens of former New Yorkers who in recent years have decamped for Newburgh, hoping to rescue one of New York State\u2019s most notorious cities by way of architectural restoration.         \n\nRestoring, it needs. Newburgh was George Washington\u2019s Revolutionary War headquarters; that 18th-century farmhouse still stands in the center of town. Later it was the stamping ground of the 19th century\u2019s version of today\u2019s \u201cstarchitects,\u201d including \nand his disciples, like  \n and  \n. Their work \u2014 grand Second Empire Victorian, Gothic revival and Queen Anne houses \u2014 is everywhere.         \n\nBut the city succumbed to a panoply of 20th-century ills: deindustrialization; urban renewal, which claimed a third of the city\u2019s older homes and detached the city from its waterfront; and the creation of the Newburgh-Beacon bridge, which replaced the ferry as the main mode of transport across the river and took visitors around the city rather than through it. Now, more than a quarter of the population lives below the poverty line. Blight is ubiquitous, pockmarking the streetscape between renovated homes, and the city has a well-known  \n.         \n\n\u201cIt has a grittiness and an elegance,\u201d said  \n, an actor and director from Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, who bought and rehabbed a house on one of Newburgh\u2019s more infamous blocks last year. \u201cThere\u2019s so much beauty and so much decay, and so much potential.\u201d         \n\nThe most direct route to that potential, many believe, is through the city\u2019s affordable architecture. Fixer-uppers can sell for as little as $30,000, and renovated Victorian homes with Hudson River views can be had for $200,000. One nonprofit group markets the city as \u201cLike Brooklyn, but affordable.\u201d         \n\nNewburgh is reminiscent of that borough in its urban fabric, with its dense pockets of rowhouses and its racially diverse population. But it is perhaps the only city vying for the title of \u201cthe next Brooklyn\u201d that likens itself more to 1980s Brooklyn than the current incarnation, with its locavore restaurants and multimillion-dollar condos.         \n\n\u201cWhen we moved to Brooklyn 30 years ago, there were drug dealers down the street,\u201d said Judy Johnson, who, with her partner, Terri Vargas, bought a 5,600-square-foot Victorian designed by Calvert Vaux in Newburgh in 2001. That old Brooklyn street: Prospect Park West.         \n\nSherry Ou-yang, a family therapist who had been living in Ditmas Park in Brooklyn, first saw a foreclosed Second Empire Victorian house in Newburgh listed online for $199,000. It was too expensive then, but when the price dropped to $35,000 in 2009, she bought it from the bank; by then, it was in serious disrepair, mirroring the decay around it. \u201cWe saw that we could really make a difference in this community, just through fixing a house,\u201d she said.         \n\nPioneering in real estate can be morally ambiguous, benefiting homeowners who score a bargain and, in many cases, who profit from a previous owner\u2019s grief. But Newburgh has at least 700 vacant buildings, inflating property taxes; the more taxpaying homeowners there are, the lower the taxes for everyone.         \n\n\u201cThe people who are moving in are helping because they\u2019re putting more properties on the tax roll,\u201d said\u00a0Deirdre Glenn, a lifelong Newburgher and former executive director of the local chapter of Habitat for Humanity, which has built 72 neo-Victorian homes for low-income families in some of Newburgh\u2019s most challenged areas. She noted that it can be hard to get  \n or sell a house when the surrounding properties are abandoned. \u201cNewburgh was really depressing and very run-down and very rough and at times threatening,\u201d Ms. Glenn said. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to see people caring about their houses again.\u201d         \n\nThis is not just gentrification, say longtime Newburghers as well as the newcomers. The new arrivals are not replacing lifelong residents to open artisanal mayonnaise shops; instead they are joining the community. Decora Sandiford, a hip-hop artist who moved from Brownsville, Brooklyn, to Newburgh in 2005, said his block had 13 abandoned properties when he moved; now there are three, the others having been renovated by residents of diverse classes, races and sexual orientations. \u201cIt\u2019s not just developers or just middle-class white people buying these houses \u2014 it\u2019s black people and Latino people, and they might not even be middle-class,\u201d he said. Mr. Sandiford said that fixing up properties forces neighbors to stop dumping their garbage on the sites. \u201cIt makes everyone stay on top of their game,\u201d he said.         \n\nThough many people in Newburgh are happy to see the abandoned buildings restored, some are skeptical about the impact on the city\u2019s entrenched problems, including its lack of industry and its continuing battle against drugs and gangs.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great that the houses are getting fixed up,\u201d said Kendrick Robinson, a lifelong resident. \u201cBut they have to do something about the crime, the transportation and the jobs.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/nyregion/newburgh-ny-seeks-renewal-without-gentrification.html", "date": "2013-11-08", "description": "Drawn to the affordable, historic houses in Newburgh, N.Y., former New York City residents are attempting an architectural and civic restoration of the troubled upstate city."}
