{"headline": "Hackers From China Resume Attacks on U.S. Targets", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Three months after hackers working for a cyberunit of China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army went silent amid evidence that they had stolen data from scores of American companies and government agencies, they appear to have resumed their attacks \u00a0using different techniques, according to computer industry security experts and American officials.         \n\nThe Obama administration had bet that \u201cnaming and shaming\u201d the groups, first in  \n and then in the  \n of Chinese military capabilities, might prompt China\u2019s new leadership to crack down on the military\u2019s highly organized team of hackers \u2014 or at least urge them to become more subtle.         \n\nBut Unit 61398, whose well-guarded 12-story white headquarters on the edges of Shanghai became the symbol of Chinese cyberpower, is back in business, according to American officials and security companies.         \n\nIt is not clear precisely who has been affected by the latest attacks.  \n, a private security company that helps companies and government agencies defend themselves from hackers, said the attacks had resumed but would not identify the targets, citing agreements with its clients. But it did say the victims were many of the same ones the unit had attacked before.         \n\nThe hackers were behind scores of thefts of intellectual property and government documents over the past five years, according to  \n by Mandiant in February that was confirmed by American officials. They have stolen product blueprints, manufacturing plans, clinical trial results, pricing documents, negotiation strategies and other proprietary information from more than 100 of Mandiant\u2019s clients, predominantly in the United States.         \n\nAccording to security experts, the cyberunit was responsible for a 2009 attack on the Coca-Cola Company that coincided with its  \n to acquire the China Huiyuan Juice Group. In 2011, it  \n, a maker of data security products used by American government agencies and defense contractors, and used the information it collected from that attack to break into the computer systems of Lockheed Martin, the aerospace contractor.         \n\nMore recently, security experts said, the group took aim at companies with access to the nation\u2019s power grid. Last September, it broke into  \n, now Schneider Electric, which keeps detailed blueprints on more than half the oil and gas pipelines in North America.         \n\nRepresentatives of Coca-Cola and Schneider Electric did not return requests for comment on Sunday. A Lockheed Martin spokesman said the company declined to comment.         \n\nIn interviews, Obama administration officials said they were not surprised by the resumption of the hacking activity. One senior official said Friday that \u201cthis is something we are going to have to come back at time and again with the Chinese leadership,\u201d who, he said, \u201chave to be convinced there is a real cost to this kind of activity.\u201d         \n\nMandiant said that the Chinese hackers had stopped their attacks after they were exposed in February and removed their spying tools from the organizations they had infiltrated. But over the past two months, they have gradually begun attacking the same victims from new servers and have reinserted many of the tools that enable them to seek out data without detection. They are now operating at 60 percent to 70 percent of the level they were working at before, according to a study by Mandiant requested by The New York Times.         \n\nThe Times hired Mandiant to investigate an attack that originated in China  \n last fall. Mandiant is not currently working for The New York Times Company.         \n\nMandiant\u2019s findings match those of  \n, another security company that has also been tracking the group. Adam Meyers, director of intelligence at Crowdstrike, said that apart from a few minor changes in tactics, it was \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d for the Chinese hackers.         \n\nThe subject of Chinese attacks is expected to be a central issue in an upcoming visit to China by President Obama\u2019s national security adviser, Thomas Donilon, who has said that dealing with China\u2019s actions in cyberspace is now moving to the center of the complex security and economic relationship between the two countries.         \n\nBut hopes for progress on the issue are limited. When the Pentagon released  \n this month officially identifying the Chinese military as the source of years of attacks, the Chinese Foreign Ministry denied the accusation, and People\u2019s Daily, which reflects the views of the Communist Party, called the United States \u201cthe real \u2018hacking empire,\u2019\u00a0\u201d saying it \u201chas continued to strengthen its network tools for political subversion against other countries.\u201d Other Chinese organizations and scholars cited American and Israeli cyberattacks on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities as evidence of American hypocrisy.
