{"headline": "Justices Consider Whether Patents on Genes Are Valid", "body": "\nThe  \n is poised to take up the highly charged question of whether human genes can be patented. But another question could trump it: Has the field of genetics moved so far so fast that whatever the court decides, it has come too late to the issue?         \n\nThe case, which will come before the court on Monday, involves patents held by  \n on two human genes, which, when mutated, give a woman a high risk of getting breast or ovarian cancer. The patents give Myriad a monopoly on testing for these mutations, a highly lucrative business.         \n\nThe hearing comes as rapid scientific advances are producing an explosion of new information about human genes, as well as those of animals, plants and microbes, yielding new approaches to detecting and combating diseases.         \n\nOpponents of gene patents say no company should have rights to what is essentially part of the human body. They contend that Myriad\u2019s monopoly has impeded medical progress and access to testing \u2014 in some cases denying patients their own genetic information.         \n\nMyriad and its allies in the biotechnology industry counter that a ruling that invalidates gene patents would upend three decades of patenting practice and undermine billions of dollars of investments to develop not only genetic tests but also biotech drugs, DNA-based vaccines and  \n.         \n\n\u201cIt would chill a wide range of important activities that benefit society,\u201d the Biotechnology Industry Organization said in a friend of the court brief, one of about 50 such briefs filed in a sign of the case\u2019s potentially far-reaching consequences.         \n\nBut while the debate continues, some experts say patents on human genes are actually fading in importance.         \n\n\u201cEvents on the ground have overtaken the law,\u201d said Dr. James P. Evans, a professor of genetics and medicine at the University of North Carolina. He said the impact of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision \u201cwill be much more ideological than it will be practical.\u201d         \n\nFor one thing, the Myriad patents at issue are due to expire over the next two years. And experts say a relatively small number of other diagnostic tests or drugs are protected by patents on single genes.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this affects many patents that really matter to companies,\u201d said Robert Cook-Deegan, a professor at Duke University\u2019s Institute for Genome Sciences and Policy.         \n\nIt is often said that one-fifth of the roughly 20,000 human genes are patented. But in a study, Christopher Holman, a professor of law at the University of Missouri, Kansas City, found that many of those patents merely mentioned genes but would not block genetic testing, and many patents had been allowed to lapse.         \n\nMoreover, it will soon be possible to sequence a person\u2019s entire genome for less than the $4,000 that Myriad charges to analyze just two genes, which are called BRCA1 and BRCA2. And whole genome sequencing might not infringe patents on isolated genes.         \n\nThe case before the Supreme Court was filed in 2009 by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Public Patent Foundation on behalf of some medical societies, researchers and patients.         \n\nThe question before the court is whether isolated human genes are products of nature, and therefore ineligible for patents, or are sufficiently different from the genes found inside the body\u2019s cells.         \n\nThe plaintiffs won the first round when Judge Robert W. Sweet of Federal District Court in Manhattan said that isolated DNA was the same as DNA in the body in what really mattered \u2014 the genetic information it carries.         \n\nBut Myriad prevailed at the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, twice, by 2-to-1 decisions. One of the majority opinions said that DNA was a chemical, not an information medium, and that disconnecting DNA from the chromosome changed it enough structurally to qualify for patenting.         \n\nThe plaintiffs, appealing to the Supreme Court, are challenging this. \u201cUnder this rationale, a kidney \u2018isolated\u2019 from the body would be patentable, gold \u2018isolated\u2019 from a stream would be patentable and leaves \u2018isolated\u2019 from trees would be patentable,\u201d they say in their brief.         \n\nMyriad and allies argue that patents can and have been granted on products derived from nature \u2014 like the immune-suppressing drug rapamycin, which comes from a bacterium \u2014 as long as sufficient inventiveness is involved.
