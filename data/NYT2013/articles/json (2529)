{"headline": "Sky Blue Looks Beyond N.W.S.L. Playoffs", "body": "\nThe first season in the third attempt to establish a sustainable women\u2019s professional soccer league in the United States is nearing a close.         \n\nOn Saturday, the top four teams \u2014 Western New York, Kansas City, Portland and Sky Blue \u2014 in the eight-team National Women\u2019s Soccer League will play for a spot in the first league final. With the federations of the United States, Canada and Mexico underwriting the bill to pay their national team players, who are sprinkled throughout the league, club teams have been relieved of an expense that helped to crush its two predecessors, Women\u2019s United Soccer Association and Women\u2019s Professional Soccer.         \n\n\u201cWe wanted to take a conservative approach with the team,\u201d said Thomas Hofstetter, the president and chief executive of Sky Blue, which played its home games on the campus of Rutgers University in Piscataway, N.J. \u201cIn the past we saw people throw money at the stars, but especially in women\u2019s soccer you can have a good team built on team spirit. We built a balanced team. And by doing that this year, we were able to come in on budget, acutally under budget.\u201d         \n\nHofstetter has long been an evangelist for women\u2019s soccer. A native of Germany, he got involved in 2007. His team won the W.P.S. title in 2008 and has five consecutive winning seasons. Before the three North American soccer federations came together to launch the N.W.S.L., Hofstetter was quick to point out that in Europe, national federations subsidized relatively successful women\u2019s leagues in countries like France, Germany, Sweden and Norway. He advocated for a similar setup in the U.S.         \n\nAfter several years of playing in Central New Jersey, far from major population and news media centers, Sky Blue has struggled at the gate and been unable to build a dedicated following.         \n\nWith the league seemingly secure for at least another two seasons (Canada hosts the 2015 Women\u2019s World Cup), Hofstetter and Sky Blue have for nearly a year been holding discussions with the top executives of Major League Soccer\u2019s Red Bulls.         \n\n\u201cWe have been holding discussions, not negotiations,\u201d Red Bulls General Manager Jerome de Bontin said. He added: \u201cI am a proponent and supporter of women\u2019s soccer. I believe that women\u2019s soccer is not just a female version of the men\u2019s game, but that it has a true identity. It is an interesting game to watch. It flows well and the game has improved as players are more technical. It is cleaner than the men\u2019s game and is very entertaining to watch.\u201d         \n\nThere are three possibilities:         \n\n\u25a0 Sky Blue could play its home schedule (or a part of it) at Red Bull Arena in Harrison, N.J. Sky Blue, which at one time was in first place in the N.W.S.L., had planned to play its postseason schedule at R.B.A. had it finished in first place. But that possibility evaporated late in the regular season and Sky Blue finished fourth, and will play in Rochester on Saturday against Western New York (Fox Sports2, 8 p.m. Eastern).         \n\n\u25a0 Sky Blue and the Red Bulls could enter into a working relationship, perhaps with Sky Blue becoming a paying tenant at the stadium (by some estimates it costs $100,000 simply to open the gates at Red Bull Arena) and playing doubleheaders after the men\u2019s games. The Red Bulls could, for example, use their ticket-sales staff to also sell Sky Blue tickets.         \n\n\u25a0 The Red Bulls, a club led by de Bontin, who worked in the past with the women\u2019s programs in his native France with Paris St.-Germain and Lyon, could buy Sky Blue. The Portland Timbers are the only other M.L.S. team to own an N.W.S.L. team, and the Portland Thorns have consistently outdrawn several M.L.S. and N.A.S.L. clubs.         \n\nPortland plays at Kansas City in the other semifinal on Saturday (Fox Sports 2, 2 p.m. Eastern). \u201cPortland is showing the way in demonstrating to other M.L.S. teams that there is a commercial opportunity for women\u2019s soccer,\u201d de Bontin said.
