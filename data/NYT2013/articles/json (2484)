{"headline": "Coffin Shopping for Mom", "body": "\nI have recently planned my mother\u2019s funeral with the clear-eyed precision of an accountant and the organizational skills of the activities director at the assisted-living facility where she lives. And I have done it within a budget where there are no line items for grand final wishes.         \n\nMy mother essentially planned her own funeral when my father died 12 years ago. She believed that whatever we chose for my father (the pine box of a traditional Jewish burial or a burnished mahogany-finished coffin, a shroud or a suit) would be her fate, too.         \n\n\u201cAnd he needs to be buried with full military honors,\u201d my mother said.         \n\nMy siblings and I were set on burying my dad in a pine box. But my mother would have none of it. She was adamant that my father, rigid and trapped in his own body by Parkinson\u2019s disease for the last decade of his life, deserved every immortal luxury.         \n\nMort, the aptly named undertaker, watched us volley back and forth about how to bury my father the day before the funeral. His hands were clasped, almost prayerful, on his elegant black desk. Behind his right shoulder there was a door, which I hadn\u2019t noticed until he opened it to usher us to the other side.         \n\nIt was time to go coffin shopping.         \n\n\u201cI won\u2019t even tell you the price of this one,\u201d Mort said in front of the deluxe model. The coffin was lined in satin and lead. He knocked on the lid. \u201cAir tight.\u201d         \n\nWe moved on. As we went down the line, each coffin was a little less burnished, the lining a little thinner. There were more chances for air to seep in. My mother stopped at a gleaming mahogany casket. The honey brown shade matched her bedroom set. The coffin was lined in a shiny, rippled white satin and had a matching ruffled pillow.         \n\n\u201cThis coffin is not that air tight, but it staves off decomposition a lot longer than the traditional pine box,\u201d Mort said. I sensed that he disliked decay as much as my mother did.         \n\nMy Cuban mother is terrified of gusanos \nworms. The word was one of Fidel Castro\u2019s favorite insults. That\u2019s what he called her and other Cubans who left the island rather than serve la revoluci\u00f3n \n         \n\nWe slipped back into Mort\u2019s office to talk price. \u201cWe no longer have an installment plan,\u201d he said. He remembered the trickle of monthly payments my mother sent for years to pay him for her parents\u2019 funerals 30 years earlier.         \n\n\u201cThe coffin you picked out for your husband is $10,000,\u201d he told my mother.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want a pine box,\u201d she said adamantly.         \n\n\u201cThis is the Cadillac of coffins,\u201d Mort said of the mahogany model. Even though my father was a Chevy kind of guy, I blurted out, \u201cWe\u2019ll take it.\u201d         \n\nThe process of decomposition would be slowed down. He would be buried in a suit instead of a shroud. But I couldn\u2019t shake off the feeling that I had cheated a humble man out of a humble Jewish funeral.         \n\nTo some extent, I have betrayed my mother while prearranging her burial. Funeral costs have skyrocketed since my father died. His mahogany coffin is twice the price. I have picked out a knotty pine coffin for her \u2014 unfinished but lined with crepe and outfitted with handles. This is a coffin that puts my mother on notice that she will live and die by the biblical injunction: from dust to dust \n         \n\nAt the moment, my 78-year-old mother knows only that her three children are prepaying her funeral. She doesn\u2019t want to talk about the details. She is superstitious and her God is vengeful. Making any preparation for death courts a fickle fate and tempts the evil eye. After all, she once argued, I made her an accessory to my father\u2019s death when I didn\u2019t leave her alone until she bought a burial plot for him.         \n\n\u201cShe\u2019ll live forever,\u201d my sister said, sighing, when I drop off the funeral papers for her to co-sign. My sister and I wrested power of attorney from my mother last year.         \n\nMy sister may be right. My mother\u2019s legs don\u2019t work, but her heart is still strong, her will fierce. Even if she spends eternity in a pine box that is less than airtight, I don\u2019t see those gusanos taking on my mother.
