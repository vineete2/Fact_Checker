{"headline": "Turkish Protesters Say Talks Lead to a Tentative Agreement", "body": "\nISTANBUL \u2014 After meeting for several hours with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan at his home in Ankara, Turkey\u2019s capital, protest organizers whose fight to save an Istanbul park set off a political crisis emerged early Friday with what they called a tentative agreement that could end the civil unrest that has roiled the country for nearly two weeks.         \n\nProtest leaders said they and Mr. Erdogan had agreed that the government would not start construction in Gezi Park, in Taksim Square, until a court case against the plans had concluded, and that if the court ruled in favor of the government, the matter would be put to a referendum in Istanbul.         \n\nIn their announcement just after 3 a.m. in Ankara, organizers emphasized that the people who have occupied the park for weeks would decide its fate.         \n\n\u201cTomorrow, we are going to discuss all of this with the people in Gezi Park and hear their say,\u201d said Sami Yilmazturk, a member of Taksim Solidarity. \u201cWe are not in a position to impose anything on them, but we\u2019ve reached our goal here.\u201d         \n\n\u201cFor the first time,\u201d Mr. Yilmazturk added, \u201cthe government responded to us positively.\u201d         \n\nAs night fell Thursday and Istanbul girded for a decisive police raid on Gezi Park that officials had said was imminent, Mr. Erdogan shifted strategy once again by inviting the protest organizers to his home for talks. As protest leaders hurried to the airport, a measure of calm and a sense of reprieve descended over the park. Once again Mr. Erdogan, in handling a crisis that began with a relatively minor urban development issue but morphed into a broad uprising against his rule, had inserted himself in a matter that in other countries would have long been settled by a local planning board.         \n\nAfter over a decade of Mr. Erdogan and his religiously conservative Justice and Development Party in power, Turks have become accustomed to a micromanaging leadership style in which no matter is too small to merit the attention of the prime minister and even big foreign policy decisions pivot on the emotions and whims of one man.         \n\n\u201cOver the last decade he\u2019s become the sun around which all of Turkish politics revolves,\u201d said Steven A. Cook, a Turkey expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cThe prime minister is surrounded by yes people who won\u2019t make a decision without his approval.\u201d         \n\nSo deeply, in fact, that he has personally ordered revisions to the blueprints for a planned mosque in Taksim Square, a long-held dream of the Islamist movement in Turkey and a favorite project of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s. He has said which shawarma and kebab shops should be demolished, and given his input on the lighting for a new bridge over the Bosporus.         \n\nIn foreign policy issues, a sense of personal insult felt by Mr. Erdogan can incite drastic shifts, as it did in 2009 after Israel launched an offensive on Gaza just after the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Olmert, visited Turkey. \u201cHe was made to look like he was weak or too compliant to stop the Gaza operation,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cThat\u2019s how he felt.\u201d         \n\nWhen President Bashar al-Assad of Syria began a crackdown on protesters that has grown into civil war, Mr. Erdogan, who had vacationed with Mr. Assad, counseled restraint. So Mr. Erdogan was deeply offended when his advice went unheeded, and he quickly became the most vocal proponent of international military action to remove Mr. Assad.         \n\nIn the crisis over the park, whose preservation was the original cause of the protesters, those leadership traits have come to the fore, experts said, and explain how a seemingly small matter evolved into the biggest crisis Mr. Erdogan has faced.         \n\nMany Turks have been antagonized enough by his leadership style that they have taken to the streets, and the prime minister\u2019s response was driven in part by outrage at being challenged.         \n\nIn the current crisis, which centers on a government plan to convert the park into a replica of an Ottoman-era army barracks, Mr. Erdogan has acted more like the mayor of Istanbul, a job he held in the 1990s.
