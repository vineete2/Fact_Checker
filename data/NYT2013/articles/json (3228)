{"headline": "After Ugly Campaign, Finding Little Grace in Brooklyn District Attorney\u2019s Exit", "body": "\nSam Kellner, a voluble whistle-blower against child sexual abuse in Brooklyn\u2019s Hasidic community, received a much-dreamed-of phone call last week.         \n\nTwo prosecutors with the Brooklyn district attorney\u2019s office promised to drop all charges against Mr. Kellner. An already-weak extortion case had utterly disintegrated, with evidence falling away.         \n\nYou\u2019ll soon be free of the shadow of prosecution, Mr. Kellner\u2019s lawyers told him.         \n\nThat was last Wednesday.         \n\nTwo days later, District Attorney  \n and his rackets chief and longtime friend Michael F. Vecchione reversed that decision and again vowed to prosecute Mr. Kellner.         \n\nThey promptly demoted the two veteran prosecutors, Joseph Alexis and Nicholas J. Batsidis, who had handled the case against Mr. Kellner.         \n\nMr. Hynes was not finished. That same day, he fired Barbara Burke, a prosecutor and former nun who had had the temerity to complain that the office had not passed along \u2014 as required \u2014 all records to a lawyer trying a wrongful conviction case against Mr. Hynes and Mr. Vecchione.         \n\nHis Friday afternoon massacre complete, Mr. Hynes turned his attention to his vacation in Bermuda.         \n\nElectoral defeats offer wonderful character studies. Some handle defeat with grace; others take to bed, pull up the sheets and turn off the lights.         \n\nThen there\u2019s Mr. Hynes, 78, who ran an ugly and cantankerous howl of a final campaign and lost convincingly twice in two months, first in the Democratic primary and then, as the candidate of the Republican and Conservative Parties, in the general election. Hurling accusations, stirring communal fears, he ended a once proud career in a manner akin to crashing a car into a brick wall. No grace attended.         \n\nAsked about last week\u2019s three punishments, two of which were first reported in  \n and  \n, Mr. Hynes\u2019s longtime press man went mum. \u201cI cannot discuss personnel matters,\u201d Jerry Schmetterer told me via email.         \n\nAs for Ms. Burke, she \u201cwas fired for cause,\u201d he said.         \n\nMs. Burke, as it happens, retained the services of Mark A. Bederow, a former prosecutor with the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office. \u201cFor months they attempted to humiliate an honest and sincere public servant interested in seeing that justice was served,\u201d he said.         \n\nMr. Bederow said it was not at all unusual for prosecutors to have to seek a senior attorney\u2019s signoff before dropping prosecutions. But it is deeply unusual to overrule them. And it is unheard-of to demote senior attorneys for what amounts to a difference of legal opinion.         \n\n\u201cThe senior attorney on the case had 20 years in the office,\u201d Mr. Bederow said. \u201cYou\u2019d expect him to get a lot of rope, judgment-wise.\u201d         \n\nThe case against Mr. Kellner offers its own theater of the bizarre. After a prominent Hasidic cantor, Baruch Lebovits, was accused of groping his son, Mr. Kellner helped investigators with the district attorney\u2019s office to find other young victims.         \n\nHe found himself denounced on the street and barred from shul. His business suffered; he pawned his silverware last year. Still he persisted, and slowly picked up allies. Members of a prominent rabbinical court told me earlier this year that they had given Mr. Kellner, whom they viewed as a brave pioneer, permission to seek out victims of Mr. Lebovits, whose predatory reputation was broadly known.         \n\nIn 2011, Mr. Hynes\u2019s office convicted Mr. Lebovits of sexual abuse. It was, for Mr. Hynes, a rare successful prosecution of a prominent Hasidic figure, and it angered many in that politically influential community.         \n\nThen his office turned around and indicted Mr. Kellner, based on a secret tape and the grand jury testimony of Moshe Friedman, a prominent Satmar supporter of Mr. Lebovits. The district attorney alleged that Mr. Kellner had tried to extort hundreds of thousands of dollars from the sexually corrupt cantor. (Mr. Lebovits\u2019s lawyers used Mr. Kellner\u2019s indictment, along with technicalities, to convince a state appeals court to overturn the Lebovits conviction. The district attorney has said he intends to retry Mr. Lebovits.)         \n\nThat case descended into parody. A tape went missing. Evidence changed. This past July,  \n, as prosecutors handed over evidence that a witness against Mr. Kellner had contradicted himself repeatedly. This witness was himself fleeing abuse allegations.         \n\n\u201cThis case has something to haunt everyone\u2019s conscience,\u201d noted Niall MacGiollabhui, Mr. Kellner\u2019s lawyer. \u201cLast week, it became bizarre beyond belief.\u201d         \n\nMr. Kellner\u2019s charm is his insistence on not presenting himself as a saint. His search for justice for his son came to enfold the pain of many victims.         \n\n\u201cThey make me out to be the monster,\u201d he said Monday, pacing. \u201cI say, this is for real, you are all in cahoots? You don\u2019t care about your children?\u201d         \n\nSo a lonely man has justice grabbed away. And a broken-down horse of a politician comes up lame.
