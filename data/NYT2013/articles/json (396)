{"headline": "2004 Showdown Shaped Reputation of Pick for F.B.I.", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 If it were not for a now famous scene in a hospital just blocks away from the White House, it is unlikely that James B. Comey would have been standing in the Rose Garden on Friday to be introduced as President Obama\u2019s nominee for the director of the F.B.I.         \n\nMr. Comey was serving as acting attorney general in the Bush administration\u2019s Justice Department when he became the central figure in the most dramatic constitutional crisis of the nation\u2019s 12-year war on terrorism, and his role in the events surrounding that showdown on March 10, 2004, have shaped his public life and reputation.         \n\nHis confrontation with White House officials that March night in the cramped confines of Attorney General John Ashcroft\u2019s room at George Washington University Hospital has since made him widely lionized as a guardian of the Constitution for resisting pressure to rubber-stamp a National Security Agency surveillance program that he and others at the Justice Department believed violated the law.         \n\nA senior Obama White House official said on Friday that Mr. Comey\u2019s part in the 2004 crisis was \u201can important factor in the president\u2019s decision making\u201d when he selected him to succeed  \n as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.         \n\nMr. Obama alluded to Mr. Comey\u2019s role in announcing his choice on Friday, praising Mr. Comey as a man of \u201cfierce independence and deep integrity.\u201d         \n\nDespite the showdown, in which Mr. Comey refused the request of White House aides to reauthorize a program for eavesdropping without warrants, he was later willing to go along with most of the Bush administration\u2019s surveillance operations. He and his allies, including Mr. Mueller, eventually backed down from their threats to resign in protest after the White House made modest adjustments.         \n\nMr. Comey did not object to the key element of the Bush administration\u2019s program \u2014 the wiretapping of American citizens inside the United States without warrants. Instead, he focused on trying to curb a large data mining operation inside the United States, similar to the data mining programs at the center of the current controversy over the National Security Agency.         \n\nA former senior intelligence official who played a role in surveillance programs during the Bush administration said that Mr. Comey \u201cnever expressed any concern\u201d about the warrantless wiretapping program.         \n\n\u201cAlthough he objected to one thing, he didn\u2019t object to everything,\u201d the former intelligence official added. \u201cHe was quite comfortable with a whole bunch of things.\u201d         \n\nSome former colleagues in the Bush administration said Mr. Comey\u2019s actions were not as heroic as they have been portrayed \u2014 particularly by Mr. Comey in his 2007 Congressional testimony recounting the episode.         \n\nIn an interview, Andrew Card, a chief of staff to President George W. Bush and one of the White House officials who wanted Mr. Ashcroft to sign off on the surveillance program, played down the idea of a hospital confrontation, saying that at the time he had not realized that Mr. Comey had taken over as acting attorney general and that he was not trying to railroad him.         \n\n\u201cPolitics had nothing to do with it,\u201d Mr. Card said. \u201cSome lawyers and policy makers had one perspective, others had another.\u201d         \n\nBut a thorough review of the episode \u2014 included in a 2009 report by the inspectors general from five federal agencies, which was based on interviews with many participants, their contemporaneous notes and official duty logs \u2014 supports Mr. Comey\u2019s version of events. The joint inspector general report notes that some senior Bush White House officials, including Mr. Card, refused to be interviewed for their report.         \n\nMr. Comey, 52, a longtime federal prosecutor, was appointed deputy attorney general in December 2003, at a time of growing turmoil over the Bush administration\u2019s most contentious policies in the war on terrorism.         \n\nFor more than two years, White House officials had been creating a counterterrorism infrastructure that stretched the bounds of American law, and they had relied on a junior attorney in the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel, John C. Yoo, to provide them with the legal backing needed for their actions. But when Mr. Yoo resigned in May 2003, Mr. Ashcroft put new lawyers in charge of the Justice Department\u2019s national security legal portfolio who were unwilling to bend so easily to the demands of the White House.
