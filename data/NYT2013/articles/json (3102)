{"headline": "President Seeks to Rally Support for Syria Strike", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration began a full-press campaign on Sunday for Congressional approval of its plan to carry out a punitive strike against the Syrian government.         \n\nThe lobbying blitz stretched from Capitol Hill, where the administration held its first classified briefing on Syria open to all lawmakers, to Cairo, where Secretary of State John Kerry reached Arab diplomats by phone in an attempt to rally international support for a firm response to the Aug. 21 chemical weapons attack in the suburbs of Damascus.         \n\nMr. Kerry appeared on five morning talk shows, announcing new evidence \u2014 that the neurotoxin sarin had been used in the attack that killed more than 1,400 people \u2014 and expressing confidence that Congress would ultimately back the president\u2019s plan for military action.         \n\nBehind closed doors on Capitol Hill, the administration presented classified intelligence to any senator or House member who wished to attend. About 80 did, but some from both parties emerged from the briefing convinced that the draft language authorizing military action would need to be tightened.         \n\nThe rush of activity came a day after Mr. Obama\u2019s surprise decision to seek the authorization of Congress for a strike on the Syrian government.         \n\nAhead of an Arab League meeting in Cairo, Mr. Kerry sought to mobilize backing for American-led military action at a meeting the group held on Sunday night.         \n\nA statement that was issued by the league asserted that the Syrian government was \u201cfully responsible\u201d for the chemical weapons attack and asked the United Nations and the international community \u201cto take the necessary measures against those who committed this crime.\u201d         \n\nTo the satisfaction of American officials, the statement did not explicitly mention the United Nations Security Council or assert that military action could be taken only with its approval. But it stopped short of a direct call for Western military action against Syria.         \n\nBefore the meeting got under way, the Saudi foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, urged the international community to stop the Syrian government\u2019s \u201caggression\u201d against its people.         \n\nSaudi Arabia has been one of the principal supporters of the Syrian opposition, and Mr. Kerry consulted by phone on Sunday with Prince Bandar bin Sultan, Saudi Arabia\u2019s intelligence chief and secretary general of its national security council.         \n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s calculation has been that a call for tough action by the Arab diplomats would enable the White House to argue to members of Congress that it had regional backing for military action and would make up, at least politically, for the British decision on Thursday not to join the American-led attack.         \n\nBut Syria\u2019s government on Sunday defiantly mocked Mr. Obama\u2019s decision to turn to Congress, saying it was a sign of weakness. A state-run newspaper, Al Thawra, called the action \u201cthe start of the historic American retreat\u201d and said Mr. Obama had put off an attack because of a \u201csense of implicit defeat and the disappearance of his allies.\u201d         \n\nSyria\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Faisal Mekdad, told reporters in Damascus, \u201cIt is clear there was a sense of hesitation and disappointment in what was said by President Barack Obama yesterday. And it is also clear there was a sense of confusion, as well.\u201d         \n\nIn some measure, part of the challenge that the Obama administration faces in trying to rally support at home for a punitive strike in Syria is the result of the deep ambivalence it has expressed about becoming involved in the conflict.         \n\nPart of the White House strategy for securing Congressional support now is to emphasize not only what Syria did, but also how a failure to act against Syria might embolden enemies of Israel like Iran and Hezbollah.         \n\nMr. Kerry, in his television appearances, said that if Congress passed a measure authorizing the use of force, it would send a firm message to Iran that the United States would not tolerate the fielding of a nuclear device, and thus safeguard Israel\u2019s security.
