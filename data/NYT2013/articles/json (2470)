{"headline": "Obama Presses for Action on Bank Rules", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014  \n urged the nation\u2019s top financial regulators on Monday to move faster on new rules for Wall Street, telling them in a private White House meeting that they must work to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis.         \n\nAides said Mr. Obama also told the regulators that the United States needed a more simplified and certain system of financing housing. The president recently endorsed proposals to reduce the government\u2019s role in providing mortgages.         \n\nAdministration officials and some lawmakers have expressed frustration that critical parts of Mr. Obama\u2019s overhaul of the financial system, which was voted into law three years ago and is known as the Dodd-Frank act, remain unenforced as an alphabet soup of federal agencies wrangle over how to adopt it.         \n\nIn particular, top presidential aides have highlighted the failure in putting the  \n into effect. It would prohibit banks from risking institutional money in certain speculative investments. Last month,  \n, the Treasury secretary, complained in a speech that the regulators were moving too slowly to confront the dangers of banks that are so large that governments cannot allow them to fail for fear of bringing down the economy.         \n\n\u201cIf we get to the end of this year, and cannot, with an honest straight face, say that we\u2019ve ended \u2018too big to fail,\u2019 we\u2019re going to have to look at other options because the policy of Dodd-Frank and the policy of the administration is to end \u2018too big to fail,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Lew said.         \n\nThe meeting on Monday was an attempt to raise those concerns directly with the agencies that are responsible for turning the law into reality. Among those in attendance were Mr. Lew;  \n, the chairman of the Federal Reserve; and top officials at the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the National Credit Union Administration.         \n\nJosh Earnest, a White House spokesman, said Mr. Obama wanted to convey \u201cthe sense of urgency that he feels about getting these regulations under Wall Street reform implemented promptly.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThere are some important rules that have been put in place,\u201d he added. \u201cMore work needs to be done.\u201d         \n\nCongress passed Dodd-Frank in 2010 in response to the financial crisis of 2008. Since then, regulators have been working to turn the mammoth law into workable regulations, often in the face of opposition from lobbyists for banks that opposed the law.         \n\nAmong the rules that have yet to be put into effect, according to Treasury Department officials, are enhanced prudential standards for banks and certain other institutions, capital and margin rules for derivatives, new mortgage disclosure regulations and the Volcker Rule. Treasury officials said they expected regulators to finish work in those areas by the end of the year.         \n\nAs the banks have returned to profitability, the Obama administration has sounded increasingly impatient about the pace of bank regulation. Its desire to speed things up comes at what appears to be an opportune time. The fear that banks are too big, and could jeopardize the wider economy if they fail, is shared by people on both the left and right. Congress has introduced two bills in recent months that envision far more drastic overhauls than Dodd-Frank, both with bipartisan support.         \n\n\u201cThe politics are pretty good for the administration if they can do something on this,\u201d Nolan McCarty, a professor of politics and public affairs at Princeton.         \n\nSome lawmakers also have expressed concern that the regulators are moving too slowly. Senator  \n, Democrat of Massachusetts, and several other senators have proposed new laws that would reinstate a firewall between banks and investment firms like those in the Depression-era  \n.         \n\nSenators David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana, and Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, have introduced separate legislation that would increase the amount of capital that the nation\u2019s biggest banks are required to carry.         \n\n\u201cFor too long, financial watchdogs were asleep on the job, allowing Wall Street megabanks to become too complex to manage and regulate and \u2018too big to fail,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said a spokeswoman for Senator Brown.         \n\nShe said Senator Brown was \u201chopeful that today\u2019s meeting will lead to progress in ensuring that taxpayers and our financial system are no longer threatened by \u2018too big to fail\u2019 banks.\u201d         \n\nThe administration may also want to sound the right notes as the financial crisis\u2019s fifth anniversary approaches. The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, the event blamed for paralyzing the world financial system, occurred on Sept. 15, 2008. The fact that many rules have not been completed so long after Lehman\u2019s failure could be a source of embarrassment to the administration and regulators.         \n\n\u201cThey certainly don\u2019t want that story dominating things over the next couple of months,\u201d said Marcus Stanley, policy director of Americans for Financial Reform, a group that has called for stricter regulation of financial firms.
