{"headline": "\u2018Like\u2019 This Article Online? Your Friends Will Probably Approve, Too, Scientists Say", "body": "\nIf you \u201clike\u201d this article on a site like Facebook, somebody who reads it is more likely to approve of it, even if the reporting and writing are not all that great.         \n\nBut surprisingly, an unfair negative reaction will not spur others to dislike the article. Instead, a thumbs-down view will soon be counteracted by thumbs up from other readers.         \n\nThose are the implications of new research looking at the behavior of thousands of people reading online comments,  \n Friday in the journal Science. A positive nudge, they said, can set off a bandwagon of approval.         \n\n\u201cHype can work,\u201d said one of the researchers, Sinan K. Aral, a professor of information technology and marketing at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, \u201cand feed on itself as well.\u201d         \n\nIf people tend to herd together on popular opinions, that could call into question the reliability of \u201cwisdom of the crowd\u201d ratings on Web sites like Yelp or Amazon and perhaps provide marketers with hints on how to bring positive attention to their products.         \n\n\u201cThis is certainly a provocative study,\u201d said Matthew O. Jackson, a professor of economics at Stanford who was not involved with the research. \u201cIt raises a lot of questions we need to answer.\u201d         \n\nBesides Dr. Aral (who is also a scholar in residence at The New York Times research and development laboratory, working on unrelated projects), the researchers are from Hebrew University in Jerusalem and New York University.         \n\nThey were interested in answering a question that long predates the iPhone and Justin Bieber: Is something popular because it is actually good, or is it popular just because it is popular?         \n\nTo help answer that question, the researchers devised an experiment in which they could manipulate a small corner of the Internet: reader comments.         \n\nThey collaborated with an unnamed Web site, the company did not want its involvement disclosed, on which users submit links to news articles. Readers can then comment on the articles, and they can also give up or down votes on individual comments. Each comment receives a rating calculated by subtracting negative votes from positive ones.         \n\nThe experiment performed a subtle, random change on the ratings of comments submitted on the site over five months: right after each comment was made, it was given an arbitrary up or down vote, or \u2014 for a control group \u2014 left alone. Reflecting a tendency among the site\u2019s users to provide positive feedback, about twice as many of these arbitrary initial votes were positive: 4,049 to 1,942.         \n\nThe first person reading the comment was 32 percent more likely to give it an up vote if it had been already given a fake positive score. There was no change in the likelihood of subsequent negative votes. Over time, the comments with the artificial initial up vote ended with scores 25 percent higher than those in the control group.         \n\n\u201cThat is a significant change,\u201d Dr. Aral said. \u201cWe saw how these very small signals of social influence snowballed into behaviors like herding.\u201d         \n\nMeanwhile, comments that received an initial negative vote ended up with scores indistinguishable from those in the control group.         \n\nThe Web site allows users to say whether they like or dislike other users, and the researchers found that a commenter\u2019s friends were likely to correct the negative score while enemies did not find it worth their time to knock down a fake up vote.         \n\nThe distortion of ratings through herding is not a novel concern. Reddit, a social news site that said it was not the one that participated in the study, similarly allows readers to vote comments up or down, but it also allows its moderators to hide those ratings for a certain amount of time. \u201cNow a comment will more likely be voted on based on its merit and appeal to each user, rather than having its public perception influence its votes,\u201d it explained when  \n.         \n\nDuncan J. Watts, a scientist at Microsoft Research, said the overall findings fit with \u201ccumulative advantage,\u201d the idea that something that starts slightly more popular will build upon that popularity until it is far ahead of its competitors \u2014 and conversely, something that does not catch on will usually fade away whether or not it is good.         \n\nHe cited the new crime novel \u201cThe Cuckoo\u2019s Calling,\u201d by Robert Galbraith, which received good reviews but tiny sales when it was released in April. When it was  \n, the book suddenly had the cumulative advantage conferred by the Harry Potter series and jumped to the top of best-seller lists.         \n\n\u201cThe biggest obstacle to success is just being noticed,\u201d Dr. Watts said.         \n\nBut opinions do not invariably follow popularity. In an earlier experiment by Dr. Watts, people listened to a list of songs ranked by popularity and were asked to rate them. But for some, the list was inverted \u2014 what they were told was the most popular song was actually the least popular.         \n\nThe incorrect list did affect how listeners rated the songs \u2014 the good songs never achieved the same popularity as among listeners who were given the correct list, and the bad songs did better than they would have otherwise.         \n\n\u201cBut we also found, in a result that was somewhat consistent with the result here, that sometimes the songs were able to recover their sort of real ranking in spite of the manipulation,\u201d Dr. Watts said. The listeners, he said, \u201cin effect noticed that the song was better or worse than we had made it seem.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/09/science/internet-study-finds-the-persuasive-power-of-like.html", "date": "2013-08-08", "description": "A positive nudge can set off a bandwagon of approval, researchers found, but negative reaction does not spur others to \u201cdislike.\u201d"}
