{"headline": "After Two-Stroke Penalty, Woods Plays On", "body": "\nAUGUSTA, Ga. \u2014 As the cheers for  \n on the first tee gave way to the relative hush of patrons hoofing it to the green, a man behind the tee box turned to his wife and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t hear anybody call Tiger a cheater.\u201d         \n\nWoods came into his 19th Masters with his body sound, his personal life settled and his putting stroke sharp. Just when all the wrinkles had seemingly been smoothed out in his crazy quilt of a life, controversy ruffled the calm. Instead of concentrating on his pursuit of his 15th major championship, Woods awoke Saturday having to defend himself against a rules violation he committed in the second round.         \n\nGranted a reprieve from the tournament rules officials that came wrapped in a two-stroke penalty, Woods got back the two strokes in his third-round 70 and was tied for seventh with Tim Clark, at three-under-par 213.         \n\nThey are four strokes behind the leaders, Brandt Snedeker and \u00c1ngel Cabrera. Woods has never won the Masters from behind, having held at least a share of the lead in his four victories.         \n\n\u201cIt started off obviously different,\u201d Woods said, referring to his day, \u201cbut I\u2019m right there in the ballgame.\u201d         \n\nWoods kept his postround interview short, and could anybody blame him? His detailed description of his decision-making process on his drop at No. 15 on Friday got him tangled in controversy.         \n\nHe was three strokes off the lead, held by Jason Day, at the completion of Friday\u2019s second round. On the 15th hole, Woods\u2019s third shot hit the flagstick and rolled off the green and into the water. After taking a one-stroke penalty, Woods dropped his ball in the fairway, a few feet behind his original divot to give himself a more comfortable distance to the pin for his wedge shot. It was a good tactic \u2014 his ball stopped 3 feet from the pin \u2014 but it also violated  \n, which states that when choosing to drop near one\u2019s original divot, a golfer should play his ball \u201cas nearly as possible\u201d at the spot from which the first ball was played.         \n\n\u201cYou know, I wasn\u2019t even really thinking,\u201d Woods said Saturday. \u201cI was still a little ticked at what happened and I was just trying to figure, \u2018O.K., I need to take some yardage off this shot.\u2019\u00a0\u201d He added, \u201cEvidently, it was pretty obvious I didn\u2019t drop it in the right spot.\u201d         \n\nBefore Woods finished his second round, a television viewer texted a Masters rules official to call attention to the infraction. The rules committee, led by Fred Ridley, reviewed Woods\u2019s drop and saw nothing wrong. In a television interview after his round, Woods said he purposely dropped the ball two yards behind his first divot, which raised some questions in Ridley\u2019s mind.         \n\nRidley spoke with Woods on the phone Friday night and met with him at the club on Saturday morning. After hearing Woods\u2019s explanation, Ridley said, \u201cI told Tiger that in light of that information that we felt that he had, in fact, violated Rule 26 under the Rules of Golf and that he was going to have to be penalized.\u201d         \n\nWoods could have been disqualified for signing an incorrect scorecard. In allowing him to remain in the field, the Rules Committee invoked  \n, which allows a penalty of disqualification to be waived or modified in exceptional cases. The rule was instituted in 2011 to protect the players from retroactive disqualifications in instances in which armchair rules officials called in from home, as happened Friday, to report incidental violations that can be picked up on high-definition telecasts, like touching a twig on a backswing or a ball oscillating on the green.         \n\n\u201cIf it was done a year or two ago, whatever, I wouldn\u2019t have the opportunity to play,\u201d Woods said. \u201cBut the rules have changed, and under the Rules of Golf I was able to play.\u201d         \n\nThe committee\u2019s decision not to disqualify Woods, who has 77 tour wins, for hitting his ball from the wrong place reinforced how the Rules of Golf, once as black and white as records on a page, have grown blurry. From the definition of a legal putting stroke to the enforcement of slow play, there has been confusion about the way to interpret and apply the rules.         \n\nOn Friday, Guan Tianlang, a 14-year-old amateur from China, became the only known player in Masters history to be assessed a one-stroke penalty for slow play, which is endemic on the tour. Many players in the field wondered why Guan was singled out when some professionals routinely play with great deliberation and are never penalized.         \n\nOn Saturday, Adam Scott, with a 69, and Tim Clark, with a 67, moved into the top seven using long putters that they anchor, a stroke that the United States Golf Association and the R&A have proposed banning.         \n\nRidley said that Augusta National officials did not consider disqualifying Woods on Saturday because it would have been \u201cgrossly unfair\u201d to do so when officials had not talked to him about the drop before he signed his scorecard Friday. Asked if he was concerned with the perception that Woods might have received preferential treatment as the world\u2019s top-ranked player, Ridley said: \u201cI can\u2019t really control what the perception might or might not be. All I can say is that unequivocally this tournament is about integrity. If this had been John Smith from wherever, he would have gotten the same ruling because again, it is the right ruling under these circumstances.\u201d         \n\nIt was the second time this year that Woods had been penalized for an illegal drop. In the second round of his season opener in the United Arab Emirates, he missed the cut after being given a two-stroke penalty for wrongly taking a free drop.         \n\nDavid Duval, a former world No. 1, was among the people who took to Twitter to say Woods ought to disqualify himself. \u201cI think he should WD,\u201d Duval wrote. \u201cHe took a drop to gain an advantage.\u201d         \n\nOthers, like Graeme McDowell, the 2010  \n champion, took a different view. \u201cTake the fact that it was Tiger out of the equation, and it is a fair ruling,\u201d he said. \u201cSince it is him, the debate begins about TV ratings, etc., etc.\u201d         \n\nWhat did Woods think?         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cUnder the Rules of Golf, I can play.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/sports/golf/woods-faces-disqualification-at-augusta.html", "date": "2013-04-13", "description": "After being assessed a two-stroke penalty Saturday for hitting from the wrong spot on the 15th hole a day earlier at the Masters, Tiger Woods finished the third round at three under par."}
