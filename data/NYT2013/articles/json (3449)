{"headline": "Case Explores Rights of Fetus Versus Mother", "body": "\nJACKSON, Wis. \u2014 Alicia Beltran cried with fear and disbelief when county sheriffs surrounded her home on July 18 and took her in handcuffs to a holding cell.         \n\nShe was 14 weeks pregnant and thought she had done the right thing when, at a prenatal checkup, she described a pill addiction the previous year and said she had ended it on her own \u2014 something later verified by a urine test. But now an apparently skeptical doctor and a social worker accused her of endangering her unborn child because she had refused to accept their order to start on an anti-addiction drug.         \n\nMs. Beltran, 28, was taken in shackles before a family court commissioner who, she says, brushed aside her pleas for a lawyer. To her astonishment, the court had already appointed a legal guardian for the fetus.         \n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know unborn children had lawyers,\u201d recalled Ms. Beltran, now six months pregnant, after returning to her home north of Milwaukee from a court-ordered 78-day stay at a drug treatment center. \u201cI said, \u2018Where\u2019s my lawyer?' \u201d         \n\nUnder a Wisconsin law known as the \u201ccocaine mom\u201d act when it was adopted in 1998, child-welfare authorities can forcibly confine a pregnant woman who uses illegal drugs or alcohol \u201cto a severe degree,\u201d and who refuses to accept treatment.         \n\nNow, with Ms. Beltran\u2019s detention as Exhibit A, that law is being challenged as unconstitutional in a \n, the first in federal court to challenge this kind of fetal protection law. Its opponents are hoping to set an important precedent in the continuing tug of war over the rights of pregnant women and legal status of the unborn.         \n\nWisconsin is one of four states, along with Minnesota, Oklahoma and South Dakota, with laws specifically granting authorities the power to confine pregnant women for substance abuse. But many other states use civil-confinement, child-protection or assorted criminal laws to force women into treatment programs or punish them for taking drugs.         \n\n\u201cThis is what happens when laws give officials the authority to treat fertilized eggs, embryos and fetuses as if they are already completely separate from the pregnant woman,\u201d said Lynn M. Paltrow, executive director of  \n in New York, of Ms. Beltran\u2019s arrest and confinement.         \n\nThe Wisconsin law, according to the suit filed in United States District Court in Milwaukee, deprives women of physical liberty, medical privacy, due process and other constitutional rights. It is also based on faulty information about the risks to newborns and ultimately does more harm than good, the suit argues, by scaring pregnant women away from prenatal care.         \n\nBonnie Ladwig, a retired state representative who helped write the law, called it an appropriate effort to prevent harm. \u201cIt\u2019s the same as abuse of a child after it\u2019s born,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the mother isn\u2019t smart enough not to do drugs, we\u2019ve got to step in.\u201d         \n\nThe law is intended \u201cto help both the woman and her baby,\u201d said Susan Armacost, the legislative director of  \n, whose group lobbied hard for the measure. Similar policies have won strong support from anti-abortion groups around the country, in part because they advance the goal of granting independent personhood and rights to the unborn child.         \n\nThe suit is being argued by National Advocates for Pregnant Women along with the  \n and  \n, a Wisconsin lawyer who was eventually hired by Ms. Beltran\u2019s mother. Wisconsin officials have not yet responded in court and declined to comment.         \n\nMs. Paltrow\u2019s group has  \n nationally over the last decade in which women were detained, arrested or forced to accept medical procedures in the name of fetal protection, with low-income and minority women affected disproportionately.         \n\nIn the most extreme example, Alabama has applied a 2006 \u201cchemical endangerment of a child\u201d law, originally passed to protect children from methamphetamine laboratories, to prosecute about 100 women whose newborns tested positive for drugs, sending several new mothers to prison.         \n\nCourts in more than 20 states have blocked the use of criminal child-abuse or related laws against pregnant women. But in January the Alabama Supreme Court  \nuse of the endangerment law from the moment of conception.         \n\nIn Wisconsin, because child-welfare proceedings are confidential, no one knows how often the 1998 law has been used, but  \n suggests it may happen a few times each year at least.         \n\nMany medical experts say that these laws are based on exaggerated perceptions of the risks to newborns and are medically counterproductive.         \n\nIn 2011,  \n that \u201cincarceration and threat of incarceration have proved to be ineffective in reducing the incidence of alcohol or drug abuse\u201d and that mandated testing and reporting lead women to avoid prenatal care that \u201cgreatly reduces the negative effects of substance abuse during pregnancy.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/24/us/case-explores-rights-of-fetus-versus-mother.html", "date": "2013-10-23", "description": "A pregnant woman who acknowledged previous painkiller addiction found herself accused of endangering her unborn child and ordered to a drug treatment center."}
