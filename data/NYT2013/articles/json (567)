{"headline": "Hernandez Among Many Who Found Trouble at Florida in the Meyer Years", "body": "\nAs the  \n dominated college football for the better half of a decade under Coach Urban Meyer, the Gators accumulated numbers \u2014 of victories and accolades and championships \u2014 at dizzying rates. In six seasons, they won 65 games, two Southeastern Conference championships and two national titles.         \n\nIn recent years, though, another number has been affixed to the Meyer era. That number is 31, as in, at least 31 arrests of Florida\u2019s football players from 2005 to 2010.         \n\nMany of the charges were typical of college campuses: under-age drinking, disorderly conduct, violations of open-container laws. But other, more serious charges included aggravated stalking, domestic violence by strangulation, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny and fraudulent use of credit cards, according to criminal record databases. Most of the cases never went to trial, the charges having been dropped or pleaded down.         \n\nThe unsavory underbelly of the Gators\u2019 football dominance was recently highlighted when Aaron Hernandez, a starting tight end on the 2008 national championship team who later played for the New England Patriots, was accused by authorities of committing an execution-style murder in Massachusetts. While at Florida, Hernandez had run-ins with the police in Gainesville, who questioned him and three teammates after a 2007 shooting and recommended a felony battery charge against him after a fight at a restaurant (the case was not pursued).         \n\nThe 2008 team provides a window into Florida football during that period. Tim Tebow was the star, a full-fledged phenomenon as beloved for his strong faith and motivating personality as for his on-field dominance. But a number of players on the team did not live up to Tebow\u2019s ideal.         \n\nA roster on the university\u2019s Web site lists 121 players, 41 of whom have been arrested, either in college or afterward, and sometimes both. That number included 16 players on that season\u2019s final two-deep roster, nine of whom were starters, as well as a kicker, punter and returner. Several of those players went on to the N.F.L., and one, Carolina Panthers  \n, later won the Heisman Trophy playing for Auburn.         \n\nAfter Hernandez\u2019s arrest, Florida declined to comment. Meyer, about to start his second season as coach of Ohio State, initially declined to answer questions about Hernandez, a player who reportedly went to regular Bible study in Meyer\u2019s home.         \n\nBut Meyer\u2019s wife, Shelley, posted on her Twitter page, \u201cWhen will we start holding individuals accountable for their own decisions/actions and stop blaming any/everyone else?\u201d She added the hashtag \u201cliveyourliferight.\u201d         \n\nMeyer made a similar comment in a text message that was reported Saturday by a sportswriter for The Columbus Dispatch.         \n\n\u201cRelating or blaming these serious charges to the University of Florida, myself or our staff is wrong and irresponsible,\u201d Meyer told the sportswriter, Tim May.         \n\n\u201cOur staff, myself and our families worked very hard to mentor and guide him,\u201d he said of Hernandez.         \n\nFor much of Meyer\u2019s tenure at Florida, Tebow was the focus, his personal fan base as large as any in college sports history. His presence was so overwhelming that he overshadowed his teammates and their arrest records.         \n\nBut in 2009, the number of arrests was such that The Orlando Sentinel, which covers the university, decided to maintain an online database to keep track of them.         \n\nThose charged included safety Jamar Hornsby, who was accused of ringing up 70 fraudulent charges in 2008 on a credit card that belonged to a woman who died in a motorcycle crash. He had also been charged with property damage and criminal mischief a year earlier.         \n\nRonnie Wilson, a lineman from Meyer\u2019s initial 2005 recruiting class, punched and spat on a man, then opened his trunk, grabbed an AK-47 and opened fire outside a nightclub in April 2007, a police report charged. He was later arrested on charges of marijuana possession and of battery and assault.         \n\nSafety Dorian Munroe was charged with felony theft, accused of removing a parking boot affixed to his car. Safety Tony Joiner was charged with breaking into an impound lot to retrieve his girlfriend\u2019s towed car. Defensive end Jermaine Cunningham was arrested after an altercation with an employee at the sandwich shop Jimmy John\u2019s.
