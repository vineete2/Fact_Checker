{"headline": "Almanacs Foresee a Super Bowl to Test Fans\u2019 Resolve, and Snow Gear", "body": "\nWhen the N.F.L. owners met near Dallas three years ago and chose to hold  \n XLVIII in New Jersey, it was a balmy 90 degrees and dry as a bone. The 80,000 fans who attend the game in February may be happy if it is half as warm.         \n\nThis season\u2019s Super Bowl will be the first played outdoors in a cold climate, and if all goes well, cities like Boston, Chicago and Denver may bid to host future games. But in voting to reward  \n and the Giants for spending $1.6 billion to build MetLife Stadium, the N.F.L. owners sparked a host of prognostications, some of which call for Snowmaggedon on game day.         \n\nAlmanacs, in particular, outhouse companions to many a farmer long ago, have been boldly predicting a grim Super Bowl. Using mathematical and astronomical formulas that take into account sunspots, tides, the position of the planets and other factors, Caleb Weatherbee, the pseudonym of the forecaster at the  \n early February and expects \u201ccopious wind, rain, and snow\u201d around the time of the game.         \n\n\u201cThey should have checked with us before they scheduled the game in New Jersey,\u201d said Sandi Duncan, the managing editor of the almanac. \u201cIf I was paying that much for a ticket, I might not want to sit in the snow.\u201d         \n\nNot to be outdone, the  \n, which is about a quarter-century older than the Farmers\u2019 Almanac, said a nor\u2019easter could hit the New York-New Jersey metropolitan area at the beginning of February and, depending on the storm\u2019s track, dump snow or rain on the stadium.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing something that\u2019s damn near impossible and doing it for a long time,\u201d said Tim Clark, a contributing editor. Unfortunately, he said, \u201cwe haven\u2019t directly determined the correlation between the solar cycles and the Cover 2 defense.\u201d         \n\nBoth almanacs said their weather outlooks were accurate about 80 percent of the time, so fans at the game could certainly end up dry, if not chilled. Since 2003, the temperature at Newark Liberty International Airport at kickoff on Super Bowl night has been 23 to 47 degrees Fahrenheit, and there was precipitation on only three of those days.         \n\nMost mainstream meteorologists who rely on satellites and other high-tech wizardry sniff at these outlooks and contend that it is nearly impossible to predict with any precision what the weather will be on a specific date months in advance. Historical averages are useful, they say, but it is a fool\u2019s errand to forecast anything beyond about two weeks.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s silly to say we can predict a snowstorm three months \n in advance,\u201d said Jack Boston, \n a long-range meteorologist at  \n. \u201cOne out of 10 times, you\u2019ll get lucky.\u201d         \n\nFrank Supovitz, the N.F.L. senior vice president for events, is hedging his bets. The owners knew what they bargained for when they picked MetLife Stadium to host the game, he said. The New York-New Jersey area is the country\u2019s largest media market and an appealing destination for executives and fans who, he said, will be able to ride toboggans down Broadway.         \n\n\u201cEmbrace the cold,\u201d said Supovitz, who suggested that the almanacs predicting snowstorms were publicity hounds. \u201cI hope it snows on game day a little bit so it\u2019s captured on TV against the stadium lights.\u201d         \n\nJust in case, the N.F.L. will give all fans at the game \u201cWarm Welcome\u201d kits that include lip balm, foil blankets, hand warmers and earmuffs stuffed into a seat cushion. It is unclear whether Bruno Mars, the halftime act who hails from Hawaii, will perform with gloves and earmuffs. Perhaps he was picked in the hope he would bring warm weather with him.         \n\nDespite the hand-wringing about this Super Bowl \u2014 which coincidentally will be played on Feb. 2, Groundhog Day \u2014 the weather in other cities has been anything but predictable. The Super Bowl in Atlanta in 2000 was played indoors, but ice storms created havoc for travelers and revelers. In Texas in 2011, snow slid off the roof of the stadium and hit a few people. Fans at the Super Bowl in South Florida in 2007 dealt with strong wind and heavy rain.         \n\nFretting about the Super Bowl aside, fans endure plenty of cold and wet weather during the playoffs, especially in places like Chicago, Denver and Seattle. In fact, some of the most memorable playoff games were played in bad weather, including the so-called Ice Bowl between the host Green Bay Packers and the Dallas Cowboys in 1967 and the Snow Bowl in 2002 between the Oakland Raiders and the host New England Patriots.         \n\nOther than the obvious inconvenience for fans, inclement weather only marginally affects the game. In a study commissioned by MetLife, Stats L.L.C. determined that since 1991 there was only a 5-percentage point difference in quarterback ratings between games played in temperatures above 70 degrees and those below 40 degrees. The gaps in points scored and turnovers a game were also fairly narrow. Only field-goal percentages for attempts of 40 yards or longer were noticeably different.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s liable to be below freezing and the colder you get, the more difference there\u2019s likely to be for numbers like this,\u201d said Don Zminda, the vice president for research at Stats, referring to game statistics.         \n\nSome meteorologists, like Irv Gikofsky, who is known as Mr. G to television viewers in the New York area, said that not enough attention was being paid to the days before and after the Super Bowl, when tens of thousands of people will be traveling to and from the metropolitan area.         \n\nThough reluctant to provide a specific forecast for game day, Gikofsky said the normal low temperatures for the first four days of February were about 25 degrees, cold enough for snow.         \n\n\u201cIt could be a four-day drama,\u201d he said. \u201cBelieve it or not, this story could be bigger than the game itself.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/sports/football/almanacs-foresee-a-super-bowl-to-test-fans-resolve-and-snow-gear.html", "date": "2013-11-23", "description": "In voting to reward the Jets and the Giants with hosting Super Bowl XLVIII, N.F.L. owners sparked a host of prognostications, some of which call for Snowmaggedon on game day."}
