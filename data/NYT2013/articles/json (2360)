{"headline": "Their Home Is a Castle, Like It or Not", "body": "\nAMSTERDAM, N.Y. \u2014 Susan Phemister assumed it would be easy to flip a castle.         \n\nShe and her husband, Manfred, had been flipping real estate in zip-zip fashion since the mid-1990s, and had made a killing each time. In 1997, while working in London, they bought a condo for $170,000 and sold it the next year for $245,000. In 1999, they bought again, for $285,000, and sold a year later for $350,000. Then they moved back to New York, bought a three-bedroom place in Park Slope, Brooklyn, for $565,000 and four years later, in 2005, sold it for $1 million.         \n\nThat\u2019s when the Phemisters decided the time was right to buy a castle \u2014 a 36,000-square-footer in classic red brick, complete with 2 turrets and 134 windows \u2014 for sale at what appeared to be the low-low price of $800,000. They spent $400,000 on renovations, which won them a preservation award, and in 2007 put it back on the market at a price fit for a king, $2 million.         \n\n\u201cThe plan was for the family to live here for two years,\u201d said Ms. Phemister, a media executive and mother of three. \u201cThen we\u2019d sell and make the extra million we\u2019d need to buy a brownstone.\u201d         \n\nUnfortunately, as is now widely known, that was when the American economy took a downward turn, and, as Ms. Phemister said, \u201cThe market for castles in upstate New York dried up completely.\u201d         \n\nIn the five years since, the castle has been taken off the market and put back on several times \u2014 for $1.95 million, $1.25 million fully furnished (including a mounted bison head and 20 stuffed pheasants), $1 million and now,  \n.         \n\nAnd yet, even at 2005 prices, it remains the Phemisters\u2019 castle.         \n\n\u201cWe love living here,\u201d Ms. Phemister said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that it\u2019s someone else\u2019s turn to live in a castle.\u201d         \n\nIn many ways there is nothing different about the Phemisters\u2019 experience from what has happened to millions of other middle-aged Americans who benefited from a generation of upwardly trending real estate prices only to wake one morning, and, in an awful moment of truth, realize that they had pushed their luck once too often.         \n\nBut the fact that it is a castle, rather than, say, a high ranch, is a reminder of how big Americans allowed themselves to dream during the boom times and how long the consequences have lingered.         \n\nFor the record, the castle is the Amsterdam Armory, built in 1894 by the state for military training, though no one around here calls it anything but the castle, nor would any real estate broker hoping for a 6 percent commission ever say, \u201cA man\u2019s home is his National Guard armory.\u201d         \n\nFrom the beginning, the Phemisters understood that flipping a castle would require an elaborate plan.         \n\nShe took a corporate job that would assure benefits and a guaranteed income (a vice president for Thomson Reuters).         \n\nMr. Phemister, 55, has his own business \u2014 CD music distribution \u2014 which allows him to work out of the castle while anchoring life for their three children, now ages 12, 11 and 9.         \n\n\u201cOur whole life is a cost-benefit analysis,\u201d said Ms. Phemister, who is 47.         \n\nOn Mondays, she is often out of bed before 4 a.m. to drive the 30 minutes from here to Albany. Then she rides the train two and a half hours south to Pennsylvania Station, so she can be at her desk by 7:30. She spends three days in New York, renting rooms in people\u2019s homes for $50 a night. Wednesdays, she is on the 4:40 p.m. back to Albany and for the rest of the week works from the castle. \u201cI love that I can be up at 6 a.m., walking the dog around the castle and answering messages on my phone,\u201d she said.         \n\nMr. Phemister has 100,000 CDs taking up thousands of square feet of the castle basement. (It would not be fair to say \u201cdungeon,\u201d since there are lots of windows and the Phemisters do not torture anyone, except, given their long days, themselves).         \n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the real estate collapse that made castle life so exhausting.         \n\nAs the music industry shifted from CDs to online downloads, Mr. Phemister\u2019s business shrank by half.         \n\nTo make up the income, they rented out the castle to TV crews (HGTV\u2019s \u201cYou Live in What?\u201d) and filmmakers. For the movie \u201cAmerican General,\u201d a documentary about Benedict Arnold, the director used the castle\u2019s 10,000-square-foot gymnasium to restage the Battles of Saratoga.         \n\nBut that income was not dependable, so a few years ago they  \n, which, they say, brings in $60,000 a year. The only problem is that to maximize revenue, it is run entirely by Mr. and Mrs. Phemister, neither of whom truly needs another job.         \n\nIndeed, Mr. Phemister already has another job, coaching youth soccer.         \n\nSo instead of the castle working for the Phemisters, the Phemisters are working for the castle.         \n\nLast year the castle was one of eight buildings \u2014 including the TWA terminal at Kennedy Airport \u2014 to win an excellence award from the  \n.         \n\nThere have been several potential buyers, including a man who was looking for a good place to store his taxidermy collection; a medieval re-enactment group; and a software executive interested in using it as a country retreat and data center.         \n\nA man who owns a military museum and antiques store spent four days visiting but ultimately decided against it because his wife did not want to leave California.         \n\nWhen Ms. Phemister talks to people about the joys of castle life, they often roll their eyes and say, \u201cSure it\u2019s great to live in a castle, but what about the heating bills?\u201d Not as bad as they might be. By setting up a zone heating system, they were able to hold the 2012 utility bills \u2014 electric, gas, oil and water \u2014 to $13,076.25, though on the coldest winter days, everyone wears a hoodie and loads up on hot cocoa.         \n\nTaxes last year were $17,532.87, about half of what homeowners in the wealthiest suburbs of Westchester County pay for noncastle residences.         \n\nIn the end, people can find a million reasons not to buy a castle: Some have complained that there is not enough parking, others would prefer a castle that is deep in the woods. The fact is, the only reason to buy a castle is that you have a terrible yearning to live in a castle. \u201cIt\u2019s the supercool factor,\u201d Ms. Phemister said.         \n\nThe Phemister children are too young to remember Brooklyn, so castle life seems normal to them. They have friends over for dodge ball tournaments in the gym, sleepovers in the turrets, hide-and-seek in dimly lighted passageways.         \n\nThey are known around town as the castle children, which is mostly \u2014 but not totally \u2014 a good thing. \u201cSometimes,\u201d says Vivienne, who is in the sixth grade, \u201cpeople just want to be my friend because I live in a castle.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/23/booming/their-castle-could-be-yours-for-under-a-million.html", "date": "2013-04-22", "description": "A couple bought an armory in upstate New York and renovated it, thinking it would turn a pretty penny.
