{"headline": "The Changing Rules of Outing", "body": "\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n What a fascinating question as it zeroes in on the changing rules of outing. In the 1980s the term was first coined by AIDS activists who used the tactic as a weapon to expose the alleged hypocrisy of closeted gay politicians (and often others) with a record of homophobic votes and positions.  \n was both praised and vilified for his outing of the rich and famous in his Gossip Watch column. Representative Barney Frank, (now retired from Congress) among others, has long argued that outing can be legitimate, notably if the person in question is working against L.G.B.T. rights and causes. In 2006,  \n to Bill Maher on what is now referred to as the \u201cFrank rule\u201d: \u201cI think there\u2019s a right to privacy. But the right to privacy should not be a right to hypocrisy. And people who want to demonize other people shouldn\u2019t then be able to go home and close the door and do it themselves.\u201d         \n\nFast forward to Shepard Smith of Fox News. For anyone who missed the recent contretemps, the  \n was recently castigated for outing Mr. Smith in an article about his bad behavior at Bathtub Gin, a Chelsea bar. According to the article, the news anchor rose from his table, grabbed a waitress\u2019s elbow and yelled at her to get him a cocktail in expletive-laced terms. The article also noted in the seventh paragraph that \u201cSmith had arrived earlier that night with a straight couple and his own regular date, a muscular 6-foot-2 30-something white male, whom Bathtub Gin employees refer to as \u2018his boyfriend.'\u201d         \n\nMany of my readers responding to this question on  \n believed Mr. Smith\u2019s privacy had been violated, most notably because he\u2019s not anti-gay when it comes to marriage equality and a slew of other L.G.B.T. rights. One posted: \u201cThe reporter had no reason to write about that part of\u201d Mr. Smith\u2019s life. \u201cIt had nothing to do with the incident and comes across as nasty.\u201d And this one: \u201cSmith is a public figure but he deserves a private life. Since he isn\u2019t acting like a hypocrite in public, coming out publicly should be his own decision.\u201d         \n\nNews media outlets have had  \nwith the story, with much of it focused on the allegedly \u201csalacious\u201d nature of the Gawker piece. Not being a mind reader myself, all I can say is that intention certainly matters. Was the writer simply reporting on Mr. Smith\u2019s love life as he would for a heterosexual celebrity \u2014 or did he hope to stir the pot, if not take a pot shot at Fox News itself \u2014 trying to embarrass the network.         \n\nNo matter, the rules of outing have evolved, from a controversial strong-arming strategy to a simple declarative of a person\u2019s sexual orientation. If Mr. Smith had been at the bar with a female companion, no doubt the pair would have been mentioned in a similarly gossipy news item and as a side note we\u2019d likely assume that he\u2019s straight. For instance, how often have we read about George Clooney\u2019s girlfriends, notably Monika (the \u201cCroatian Sensation\u201d) Jakisic described by Us Weekly as \u201ca stunner\u201d in \u201ccleavage-baring lingerie \u2026.\u201d Or consider Camille Grammer of \u201cThe Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,\u201d whose ex-boyfriend has been described variously as a \u201cGreek god\u201d and showing off his \u201cab-tastic physique.\u201d Both straight by association.         \n\nIn short, not to have mentioned Mr. Smith\u2019s male companion would have rendered his sexual orientation invisible, and as \n in a new story giving \u201cgays special treatment rather than treating gays equally.\u201d         \n\nNow, what would be the rule if Mr. Smith had voiced anti-gay bias or vitriol on his program? In that case, I\u2019d hold that it\u2019s back to the \u201cFrank Rule,\u201d where the  \nis to expose or out hypocrisy. In short, outing would be fair game.         \n\nWhat does all this mean to the rest of us? Thanks in large measure to the recent gains of the marriage equality movement, we\u2019re at a tipping point when it comes to L.G.B.T. acceptance. If you\u2019re going to discuss the private details of someone\u2019s life, it\u2019s now clearer than ever that you ought to ask yourself: What are your intentions? What will be the impact? What\u2019s been previously disclosed? Just make sure your intent\u2019s not malevolent and the potential ramifications not harmful. And when in doubt, don\u2019t.         \n\nThe times \u2014 and rules \u2014 are a-changing.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/booming/the-changing-rules-of-outing.html", "date": "2013-11-05", "description": "Intention matters when a publication chooses to out a celebrity."}
