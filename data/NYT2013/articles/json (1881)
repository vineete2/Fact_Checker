{"headline": "Economists Clash on Theory, but Will Still Share the Nobel", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The economist Robert J. Shiller in 2005 described the rapid rise of housing prices as a bubble and  \n.         \n\nFive years later, with home prices well on the way to fulfilling Mr. Shiller\u2019s prediction, the economist Eugene F. Fama said he still did not believe there had been a bubble.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know what a bubble means,\u201d  \n, the author of the theory that asset prices perfectly reflect all available information. \u201cThese words have become popular. I don\u2019t think they have any meaning.\u201d         \n\nThe two men, leading proponents of opposing views about the rationality of financial markets \u2014 a dispute with important implications for investment strategy, financial regulation and economic policy \u2014 were joined in unlikely union Monday as winners of  \n.         \n\nMr. Fama\u2019s seminal theory of rational, efficient markets inspired the rise of index funds and contributed to the decline of financial regulation. Mr. Shiller, perhaps his most influential critic, carefully assembled evidence of irrational, inefficient behavior and gained a measure of fame by predicting the fall of stock prices in 2000 as well as the housing crash that began in 2006.         \n\nThey will share the award with a third American economist, Lars Peter Hansen, who developed a method of statistical analysis to evaluate theories about price movements that is now widely used by other social scientists.         \n\nThe three economists, who worked independently, were described as collectively illuminating the workings of financial markets by showing that stock and bond prices move unpredictably in the short term but with greater predictability over longer periods. The prize committee said these findings showed that markets were moved by a mix of rational calculus and irrational behavior.         \n\nMr. Fama and Mr. Hansen are professors at the University of Chicago, known as the principal home of free market economics; Mr. Shiller is a professor at Yale University. Their work \u201claid the foundation for the current understanding of asset prices,\u201d according to a statement from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards the annual prize.         \n\nYet in jointly honoring the work of Mr. Fama and Mr. Shiller, the committee also highlighted how far the economics profession remains from agreeing on the answer to a basic and consequential question: How do markets work?         \n\n\u201cIt encapsulates the state of modern economics,\u201d said Justin Wolfers, an economist at the University of Michigan. \u201cWe have big important questions that remain largely open and we have giants bringing evidence to bear. And the answer turns out to be more complicated than markets are efficient \u2014 or markets are inefficient.\u201d         \n\nThe dispute is not merely academic. The deregulation of financial markets beginning in the 1980s was justified by the view that markets are rational and efficient. Complacence about rising home prices in the 2000s similarly reflected the view that prices are inherently rational. In the aftermath of the crisis, conversely, the work of Mr. Shiller and other proponents of behavioral economics \u2014 the integration of psychology into economic models \u2014 has been influential in shaping an intensification of financial regulation. And Federal Reserve officials are now debating whether bubbles can be identified and when they should be popped.         \n\nMr. Fama, 74, was honored for showing in the 1960s that asset prices are \u201cextremely hard to predict over short horizons.\u201d He has said the seeds of his theory were planted as an undergraduate at Tufts University, while working for a professor who ran a stock market forecasting service. Mr. Fama was charged with devising and testing forecasting schemes, which invariably failed to work. He later coined the term \"efficient markets\" to describe his view that  \n.         \n\nThe theory basically asserted, in the words of the economist Burton Malkiel, that \u201ca blindfolded monkey throwing darts at a newspaper\u2019s financial pages could select a portfolio that would do just as well as one carefully selected by experts.\u201d         \n\nIt has been repeatedly validated, sometimes in experiments involving actual monkeys. And while many market prognosticators on Wall Street still thrive in part by claiming that they can offer investments that will consistently beat the market averages, Mr. Fama\u2019s well-established theory has influenced the way millions of people now invest, contributing to the popularity of index funds that hold broad, diversified baskets of equities.         \n\nMr. Shiller, 67, introduced in the early 1980s an important limitation on the idea that markets operate efficiently.  \n. Moreover, he found that some of those irrational deviations fell into predictable patterns.         \n\nMr. Fama is among the economists who have since documented other patterns of predictable price movements, although he explains these patterns as a form of compensation for the greater risk associated with some assets.
