{"headline": "As Art Values Rise, So Do Concerns About Market\u2019s Oversight", "body": "\nWhen some of the world\u2019s richest people gather for the glittering New York auction season this spring, they will spend hundreds of millions of dollars in an art market that allows opaque transactions and has few outside monitors.         \n\nAt major auctions the first bids announced for a piece are typically fictional \u2014 numbers pulled from the air by the auctioneer to jump-start bidding.         \n\nCollectors can find themselves being bid up by someone who, in exchange for agreeing in advance to pay a set amount for a work, is promised a cut of anything that exceeds that price.         \n\nAnd year round, galleries ignore with impunity a 42-year-old law that says they must post their prices.         \n\nArt sales in New York, at galleries or at auction, are estimated at $8 billion a year. Yet the last significant change in the city\u2019s auction regulations took effect more than two decades ago, when the value of transactions was less than half of what it is today.         \n\nMany in the art world insist there is no need for further scrutiny of a market that prompts few consumer complaints and is vital to the New York economy. But other veterans of the business say there is mounting concern that monitoring has not kept pace with the increasing treatment of art as a commodity.         \n\n\u201cThe art world feels like the  \n market of the \u201980s and the hedge funds of the \u201990s,\u201d James R. Hedges IV, a New York collector and financier, said. \u201cIt\u2019s got practically no oversight or regulation.\u201d         \n\nFor two decades some New York State lawmakers have been trying to curb the practice known as \u201cchandelier bidding,\u201d a bit of art-market theater in which auctioneers begin a sale by pretending to spot bids in the room. In reality the auctioneers are often pointing at nothing more than the light fixtures.         \n\n\u201cThe time has come to give up this fiction that there are actual real bidders,\u201d said David Nash, a gallery owner who spent 35 years as a top executive with  \n.         \n\nBut nine bills submitted in Albany over the years to ban the practice failed. So today, in a city that seeks to regulate soda consumption, chandelier bidding remains 100 percent legal. The law says auctioneers can announce such bids as long as they stop before reaching a sale item\u2019s reserve price, the confidential minimum amount that sellers have agreed to accept.         \n\nAuction houses say that the bidding practice is harmless, fully disclosed and widely understood by collectors, and that it protects the seller by, among other things, preserving the drama that draws buyers to a sale.         \n\n\u201cPeople like to say that the art market is unregulated,\u201d said Jane A. Levine, senior vice president and compliance director for Sotheby\u2019s. \u201cNothing could be further from the truth. There are bespoke auction rules that cover this very tiny market that actually do govern the auction process.\u201d         \n\nThe New York City Consumer Affairs Department, which oversees the art market, reports few complaints from buyers or sellers, and auctioneers point to additional consumer protections provided by the state Uniform Commercial Code.         \n\nAuction officials say most criticism of their practices comes from gallery owners \u2014 their rivals for sales \u2014 who they say operate without oversight. \u201cThe dealers are not regulated at all,\u201d said Patricia G. Hambrecht, chief business development officer for the Phillips auction house.         \n\nSome perceptions of the market as an insiders\u2019 game stem from recent lawsuits against galleries, including three by collectors who  \n.         \n\n\u201cIs there any reason to believe that regulating the art market will be any more effective than regulating the financial markets has been?\u201d asked Jonathan Brown, a professor at New York University\u2019s Institute of Fine Arts. \u201cMany of the players are identical.\u201d         \n\nBut others say that, given the money involved and the number of newly wealthy buyers, stricter rules are a must.         \n\n\u201cIdeally any tightening of the rules would be self-imposed,\u201d said Michael Plummer, a former  \n executive who is now a principal in Artvest Partners, an art advisory company. \u201cUnfortunately I don\u2019t think the markets are going to have the discipline to do that.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\nPerhaps nothing illustrates the art market\u2019s laissez-faire spirit better than the way galleries flout New York City\u2019s \u201ctruth in pricing\u201d law. It says items for sale, including art, must have a price tag conspicuously displayed. None of 10 galleries visited at random this month had posted prices, though a few smaller ones produced price lists when asked. At the David Zwirner gallery in Chelsea a woman at the front desk seemed indignant when asked if she had a price list.         \n\n\u201cI do not,\u201d she said.         \n\nIn 1988 Consumer Affairs officials cracked down on galleries that did not post prices; 19 violators were cited.
