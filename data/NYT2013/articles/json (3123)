{"headline": "Trading Privilege for Privation, Family Hits a Nerve in South Africa", "body": "\nMAMELODI, South Africa \u2014 Regina Matshega was gossiping with a neighbor over a fence between their shacks in the Phomolong squatter camp last month when a very unexpected sight suddenly popped into view: two ruddy-cheeked white South Africans, a man and a woman, with two towheaded toddlers running at their heels.         \n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe my eyes,\u201d Ms. Matshega said. \u201cWhat are white people doing here? They live in the rich places. They never come this side.\u201d         \n\nThe white couple wandered over, past the gutter overflowing with raw sewage, to say hello. They introduced themselves as Julian and Ena Hewitt, a middle-class family that lives in a gated estate in Pretoria, just six miles away. They had moved into a 100-square-foot shack with no electricity or running water next to their part-time housekeeper, Leah Nkambule, to experience what life was like in an informal settlement.         \n\n\u201cThey said they wanted to see how we are living,\u201d Ms. Matshega said. \u201cCan you imagine?\u201d         \n\nThe Hewitts moved into the shack for the month of August as an experiment in radical empathy. Could a white middle-class South African family make it on $10 a day in the kind of living conditions that millions of black South Africans endure every day? \u201cIt is one thing to know from an academic perspective what divides us,\u201d said Mr. Hewitt, who also  \n. \u201cBut what is it like to actually live it?\u201d         \n\nIn most countries, a family slumming it for a month would hardly be news, but in South Africa, where deep racial divides strike at the core of the nation\u2019s identity, the Hewitts\u2019 experiment made headlines and spurred heated debate.         \n\nThey left behind in their comfortable suburban home everything but the barest necessities that people in squatter camps could afford. A few changes of clothes, a couple of pots, some blankets and thin mattresses were allowed. With no running water, tepid bucket baths replaced hot showers. Instead of flushing toilets, they shared a pit latrine with their neighbors. They also left behind their cars, taking local minibus taxis instead. Their children, Julia, 4, and Jessica, 2, even had to leave their toys behind. They were allowed one book to share.         \n\n\u201cLike so many people in South Africa, we live in a bubble,\u201d said Ena Hewitt, a real estate agent. \u201cWe wanted to get outside that bubble.\u201d         \n\nBut stepping outside the sharp lines that define South Africa, a nation that endured decades of repressive white minority rule that brutally enforced racial division, can be a tricky business on many levels, the Hewitts soon learned.         \nEna Hewitt on how the experience of living in the settlement affected her children. \n\nSome people, especially residents of Mamelodi, the township that includes the squatter camp, have applauded the Hewitts for putting aside the comforts of their own life to see how the other half \u2014 or in this case, much more than half \u2014 live.         \n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a wonderful thing,\u201d said  \n, a prominent South African musician who also lives in Mamelodi. \u201cWe all need to understand each other better.\u201d         \n\nBut their experiment also poked at some of South Africa\u2019s sorest spots. Were they white slum tourists who had come to gawk at black poverty? Was this simply a publicity stunt, aimed at getting a book or movie deal \u2014 or worse still, a reality television show?         \n\nAnd even if their motives were noble, did they inadvertently confirm what many here suspect: black poverty gets little notice until a white person experiences and highlights it?         \n\nSome critics took to Twitter with outright nasty, even violent responses.\"You know what? Hope the paraffin stove falls over and you people burn in that shack. Bye!\u201d tweeted someone going by the handle @Keratilwe.         \n\n \n You know what? Hope the paraffin stove falls over and you people burn in that shack. Bye! \n\nOthers were more measured in their critique.         \n\n\u201cOne would think that after 20 years of a democracy underpinned on the idea of diversity and inclusion, white South Africans would know what would be meaningful ways to engage black South Africans,\u201d said Sibusiso Tshabalala, a young black businessman who wrote an opinion article about the Hewitts in which he referred to their experiment in township living as \u201c \n.\u201d         \n\nBusi Dlamini, executive director of Dignity International, a rights group, said that the Hewitts\u2019 motives were clearly noble, but that their experiment in township living was bound to be fraught given the history of South Africa.         \n\n\u201cIt is what I call poverty pornography,\u201d Ms. Dlamini said. \u201cThey put themselves at the center of the narrative that reinforces the centrality of whiteness in South Africa.\u201d         \n\nOsiame Molefe, a writer who is working on a book about race relations in South Africa, wrote in an e-mail that \u201cthe Hewitts\u2019 empathy project is a performance of the privilege of being relatively wealthy and white.\u201d He added: \u201cThey have sought out, won and accepted sympathy and praise for living the hardships others experience daily without receiving the commensurate plaudits.\u201d         \n\nIndeed, few have wrestled with these questions as painfully as the Hewitts themselves.         \n\n\u201cEna and I laugh about this,\u201d Mr. Hewitt said. \u201cWe just landed upon this massive social schism in South Africa.\u201d         \n\nAsked why his family decided to move to a shack rather than following the more traditional route of building a school or a playground in a township, Mr. Hewitt replied: \u201cIt\u2019s very simple. We\u2019re doing it for ourselves. We\u2019re doing it to change ourselves.\u201d         \n\nHis parents had been horrified that he decided to bring their young granddaughters to live in a township. After all, the Hewitts lived in a gated community, the kind of place where the wealthy shield themselves from South Africa\u2019s violent crime epidemic.         \n\nBut the couple insisted that their children should learn to cross South Africa\u2019s ever-present boundaries of race and class.         \n\n\u201cPeople might say it is irresponsible to bring children,\u201d Mr. Hewitt said. \u201cBut I would rather say it is irresponsible to raise children in this country who can\u2019t cross boundaries.\u201d         \nJulian Hewitt on the social differences between living in the settlement and in the suburbs of Pretoria. \n\nAmong the most immovable legacies of apartheid are the rigid geographic boundaries that separate the races. Far-flung, overcrowded townships like Mamelodi were the only urban places black people were permitted to live. Colored, or mixed race people, were restricted to their own areas, also on the periphery of cities. People of Asian descent were required to live in monoethnic suburbs as well. The nicest suburbs were for whites.         \n\nWhile well-to-do black people have moved into formerly white suburbs since apartheid ended in 1994, whites have generally not reciprocated. Indeed, even poor whites have their own slums, far from black people.         \n\nFor all their irrepressible cheer, life in a shack was not easy for the Hewitts. August is the bitterest month of South Africa\u2019s winter, and keeping warm in an uninsulated, thin-walled structure was impossible. They all slept on a pile of mattresses on the floor, fully clothed in multiple layers. Even so, in the first week the entire family had the flu.         \n\nKeeping everyone clean without running water was a daily challenge. Ms. Hewitt, who has a washing machine at home, tried scrubbing the children\u2019s clothes by hand, but she struggled with the task.         \n\n\u201cI put the girls\u2019 clothes up on the line to dry, but my neighbors all laughed at me,\u201d Ms. Hewitt said. \u201cThey said, \u2018Those are still dirty!\u2019 \u201d         \n\nAt home, the Hewitts use a gas stove that heats quickly at the flick of a wrist. In Mamelodi, the family relied on the same kind of smelly, balky paraffin cookstove their neighbors used.         \n\n\u201cA simple pasta that would take me 20 minutes at home took an hour and a half,\u201d Ms. Hewitt said.         \n\nBut the biggest surprise was how expensive it was to move around. Commuting using the local transportation that most poor people rely on ate up almost half of the family\u2019s $300 budget for the month.         \n\n\u201cIt was really an eye-opener,\u201d Mr. Hewitt said. \u201cPeople need to realize that if they are paying minimum wage, a huge portion of that is going to transport.\u201d         \n\nBut the Hewitts said they would miss many aspects of their time in the township, which ended on Aug. 30.         \nMr. Hewitt says goodbye to a neighbor in the settlement. \n\n\u201cThere is a real sense of community, where people rely on each other and take care of each other,\u201d Ms. Hewitt said. \u201cThat is something that we don\u2019t have enough of back home.\u201d         \n\nThe couple said they planned to keep up with the new friends they made. On a recent evening, Mr. Hewitt made the six-mile drive from his hilltop house back to the squatter camp to go to a lively new church the family discovered while living there.
