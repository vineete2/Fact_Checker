{"headline": "Terry McAuliffe, Democrat, Is Elected Governor of Virginia in Tight Race", "body": "\nTYSONS CORNER, Va. \u2014 Terry McAuliffe, a longtime Democratic fund-raiser and ally of Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton, was elected governor of Virginia on Tuesday, narrowly defeating the state\u2019s conservative attorney general, Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, and confirming Virginia\u2019s evolution as a state increasingly dominated politically by the Democratic-leaning Washington suburbs.         \n\nMr. McAuliffe, 56, ran as a social liberal and an economic moderate focused on job creation. Mr. Cuccinelli, a Republican who was the first attorney general to sue over President Obama\u2019s health care law, ran as a hard-line social conservative and aimed his campaign almost exclusively at the Tea Party wing of his party.         \n\nStill, despite substantially outraising Mr. Cuccinelli, $34.4 million to $19.7 million, Mr. McAuliffe won by a margin \u2014 just over two percentage points \u2014 that was smaller than some pre-election polls had suggested.         \n\nMr. McAuliffe benefited from an electorate that was less white and less Republican than it was four years ago. He drew about as large a percentage of African-Americans as Mr. Obama did last year. Blacks accounted for one in five voters, according to exit polls conducted by Edison Research. Mr. Cuccinelli\u2019s strong anti-abortion views also brought out opponents, with 20 percent of voters naming abortion as their top issue; Mr. McAuliffe overwhelmingly won their support. The top issue for voters was the economy, cited by 45 percent in exit polls.         \n\nIn a victory speech here, Mr. McAuliffe thanked the \u201chistoric number of Republicans who crossed party lines to support me\u201d and invoked a tradition of bipartisanship in Richmond, the capital. In a checklist of recent governors who had moved the economy forward, he included the incumbent, Bob McDonnell, a Republican.         \n\n\u201cOver the next four years, most Democrats and Republicans in Virginia want to make Virginia a model for pragmatic leadership that is friendly to job creation,\u201d Mr. McAuliffe said.         \n\nHis tone was notably more conciliatory than that of Mr. Cuccinelli, who struck a defiant note at a rally in Richmond, interpreting the closeness of the race to a rejection of Mr. Obama\u2019s health care law. \u201cDespite being outspent by an unprecedented $15 million, this race came down to the wire because of Obamacare,\u201d Mr. Cuccinelli said, adding, \u201cWe were lied to by our own government.\u201d         \n\nThat Mr. McAuliffe was elected in a onetime Republican stronghold while unapologetically supporting gun restrictions, same-sex marriage and abortion rights will no doubt be scrutinized by both parties, particularly by Republicans concerned about the appeal of the Tea Party in swing states and districts ahead of the 2014 midterm elections. And Mr. Cuccinelli\u2019s defeat in a Southern state will no doubt be contrasted with the Republicans\u2019 great success of the day, the dominating re-election of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who appeals to swaths of Democrats. But the close result, after a race in which Mr. Cuccinelli was substantially outspent, could make it difficult to draw firm conclusions.         \n\nMr. Cuccinelli, 45, whose passionate base seemed to give him an early edge in a race between two flawed candidates, rattled business-oriented Republicans. A surprising roster of the party\u2019s establishment \u2014 including Will Sessoms, the mayor of the largest city, Virginia Beach \u2014 endorsed Mr. McAuliffe.         \n\nMr. McAuliffe\u2019s career as a wealthy business investor yielded many unflattering and, critics said, possibly unethical details. But he neutralized the issue by arguing that Mr. Cuccinelli\u2019s social agenda, which included hostile comments about homosexuality, staunch opposition to abortion and an attempt to discredit a climate scientist at the University of Virginia, would give the state a retrograde image that would deter businesses from moving here.         \n\nA key issue was Mr. McAuliffe\u2019s embrace of a roads bill championed and signed by Mr. McDonnell, which Mr. Cuccinelli opposed because it raised taxes. In rapidly growing Northern Virginia, snarled traffic is the chief concern of chambers of commerce and Mr. McAuliffe was able to portray himself as pro-business and bipartisan.
