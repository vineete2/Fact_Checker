{"headline": "Sex Ed, 1964", "body": "\nEvery once in a while I read about sex ed in middle school and kids putting condoms on bananas and I feel kind of sad I missed out on this. This is not just because of the comic possibilities of condoms on bananas, actually anything having to do with bananas, but because kids today have so much accurate information.         \n\nI grew up in the 1950's, in a resort town in the Catskills. The only time my mother gave me any information about sex was when I was 13 and traveling alone for the first time to visit an uncle in California.         \n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t talked much about this,\u201d Ma said. \u201cBut if a strange man ever puts his hands on you, you open your mouth and scream.\u201d         \n\nVague, some might say, but I was one of those kids who had been reading adult books since I was 7 or 8; \u201cThe Carpetbaggers,\u201d \u201cPeyton Place,\u201d delving especially deep into my uncle\u2019s Mickey Spillane collection, and I considered myself rather knowledgeable.         \n\nHere is what I learned about sex from my reading:         \n\nWomen with dyed blond hair are sexually available, but may try to shoot you later.         \n\nWhen women undress to have sex their breasts start heaving uncontrollably. That\u2019s how you know they\u2019re into it, which they always are, despite wanting to kill you later.         \n\nSex always ends with an explosion, which tears through your body so intensely you see brightly colored stars. I pictured it exactly like a fireworks show, so you can imagine my disappointment years later. Of course, that may be because I was with that most accomplished of lovers, a teenage boy.         \n\nLuckily, by the time I was 16, I had moved on to more anatomically instructive reading material: Henry Miller (very acrobatic and apparently did not spend his time in Paris at the Louvre), James Baldwin (not as much sex, but what there was was choice) and, best of all, the Playboy Advisor.         \n\nYou had to haul through all sorts of tedious stuff about stereo systems and a well-stocked bar before getting to one item of sexual information and it seems to me this might have been the place where I picked up the information about Saran Wrap. I don\u2019t think it was Henry Miller because, thinking back on it, the French in those days wouldn\u2019t have needed Saran Wrap, because they went to the food market daily and wouldn\u2019t have had leftovers. On the other hand, it was so absurd even Hugh Hefner couldn\u2019t have endorsed it. Probably that was what attracted me, the silliness of it. It couldn\u2019t be viable? Could it?         \n\nThis sex tip, anyway, was that in place of a condom, one could use Saran Wrap, you just had to make certain things were well wrapped.         \n\nLooking back on it I find it hard to believe there was a teenage boy willing to go along with this, but then we were dealing with the thing a teenage boy will do anything for: sex.         \n\nSo we got the Saran Wrap and wrapped. And wrapped. And wrapped. You new readers may not know this, but in matters of safety and personal health I am scrupulous. So we kept wrapping. I cannot, even in educationally correct greengrocer terms (root vegetable? zucchini? summer squash?) do justice to the final result. Let\u2019s just say the only sexual thing possible, when we were done, was to look, and having looked, it was not something you would ever forget. Wait, I\u2019ve got it: Picture a noble palace guard, swathed in 13 layers of dry cleaner\u2019s plastic wrap, but, you know, proportional.         \n\nAnyway, summer ends, the teenage boy, who had been a waiter at one of the hotels, goes back home to New York City and this being one of the things in my life I want to block out forever, I do.         \n\nUntil one day when I am 62, in the supermarket and a voice calls out: \"Joyce! Joyce Wadler!\" And it is he. Now a shrink. Living one block away from me. Who has remembered, God help me, my full name. I chat with him for the least possible time because all I can see is that image sort of hanging over us, like a Goodyear blimp. I cannot believe he is not remembering it, too, but it\u2019s not the sort of thing I want to acknowledge. Where would I start? \"Shrink, huh, what made you get into that?\" \u201cDo much cooking?\u201d \u201cWhat do you think is better, baggies or Saran Wrap or do you like your stuff shrink wrapped?\u201d         \n\nCondoms on bananas in middle school? Great idea.
