{"headline": "Bike Sharing? Sure. The Racks? No Way.", "body": "\nBike share was easy for New York City to love in the abstract. It was not about adding bike lanes at the expense of something else; it was about sharing something that did not yet exist.         \n\nBut with the program two weeks away, many New Yorkers have turned against bike share, and for one simple reason: They did not expect it to look like this.         \n\nIn recent weeks, hundreds of stations have sprouted in Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn \u2014 empty husks sprawled 30 or 50 spaces long on city sidewalks and streets, anticipating rows of bicycles that will soon protrude from the kiosk slots. The critics say the kiosks are a blight. They clash with the character of residential areas of the West Village or Fort Greene, Brooklyn. They are already magnets for pigeons, garbage bags and dogs in need of relief.         \n\nLawsuits have been prepared. Kiosks have been defaced. At one community meeting, an inelegant analogy was drawn between the Bloomberg administration and the Taliban. \u201cNone of us are against bikes \u2014 most of us have bikes that we stow in our building,\u201d said Lynn Ellsworth, 54, from TriBeCa. \u201cBut why they put these giant racks in these little streets is crazy to me.\u201d         \n\nMany opponents knew that the rental bikes were coming \u2014 thousands of them, made available for public use \u2014 and they understood that the city would need  \n. But there was initially little uproar, nothing to match what greeted the expansion of bike lanes, a flash point of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s transportation legacy.         \n\nIndeed,  \n by The New York Times last year found broad support for cycling, with 66 percent of respondents calling bike lanes a good idea. Eleven percent of those polled said they were very likely to use bike share; 19 percent said they were somewhat likely.         \n\nNow, even some avid cyclists have found occasion to complain. At a recent community meeting on bike share in the West Village, Jane Browne, 42, who initially supported the program, said she had recently seen mice scurrying in the \u201ccorridors of trash and water\u201d that formed between a nearby bike station and the curb.         \n\nShelly Mossey, 58, from Battery Park City, has protested the planned removal of a widely used rack for private bikes near South End Avenue, calling it a pillar of the neighborhood. His son\u2019s bike is on there, he said, and so are his peers\u2019. Families mingle at the rack before retrieving their bikes and escorting their children to school. \u201cWhy do we have to lose that,\u201d Mr. Mossey asked, \u201cand give it up for the bigger picture?\u201d         \n\nOther residents have rebelled against  \n, Citibank, whose logo on bike kiosks prompted vandals in Fort Greene to post fliers at the stations. They read, in all capital letters, \u201cResidential landmark blocks are not for advertising or commercial activity!\u201d         \n\nThe city\u2019s Transportation Department said it had been warned of possible problems ahead by aides of Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, where a bike share program began in 2010. \u201cThey said you\u2019ll be hated for six months,\u201d Jon Orcutt, the department\u2019s policy director, recalled, \u201cand then you\u2019ll be loved.\u201d         \n\nStill, the Bloomberg administration had hoped to pre-empt some of the discontent. In a report timed weeks before the first Brooklyn stations were installed, the city said that community participation in the program\u2019s planning had outstripped \u201cany other public project undertaken anywhere.\u201d         \n\nThe city said it had  \n at 159 public meetings, and conducted 230 more with elected officials, property owners and other stakeholders. Planners received more than 10,000 suggestions for station locations online. But city officials, advocates and adversaries alike now concede that no amount of forewarning could have prepared residents for the sight of the stations.         \n\n\u201cPeople are attached to their streets,\u201d said Paul Steely White, the executive director of Transportation Alternatives, an advocacy group that has been among the program\u2019s greatest cheerleaders. \u201cWhen someone changes it, it\u2019s like someone rearranging the furniture in our living room.\u201d         \n\nSome neighborhood grievances  \n: complaints of lost parking and reckless riding, often from those who opposed cycling\u2019s expansion in the city long before bike share. Resident groups that have threatened legal action against the city over station locations in Manhattan \u2014 including groups from an apartment building at 99 Bank Street in the West Village and from a luxury condominium on East 55th Street \u2014 are seen as unlikely to affect the program\u2019s introduction.
