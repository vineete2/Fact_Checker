{"headline": "Noisy Courtship, Quiet Breakup", "body": "\nIt was 13 months ago that  \n welcomed  \n to the team, introducing him in their spacious field house at a news conference attended by more than 200 members of the news media that snarled traffic around the team\u2019s facility in Florham Park, N.J.         \n\nOn Monday morning, the Jets cut Tebow with no pomp, a victim of circumstance. They acknowledged an experiment gone awry with  \n that said, simply, \u201cJets waive QB Tim Tebow.\u201d There was no mention in that release of Tebow\u2019s statistics with the team, perhaps in part because there were none worth mentioning.         \n\nHe was more afterthought than asset, more distraction than revelation, a decoy who played a greater role on special teams than behind center. As the Jets\u2019 season came apart into 6-10 absurdity, Tebow, frustrated and misled, emerged as a symbol of the franchise\u2019s recklessness in assembling the roster. For two draft picks and $2.53 million \u2014 including about $1.5 million still owed to Denver \u2014 the Jets acquired a sociocultural phenomenon who played on only 77 offensive snaps, rushed 32 times for 102 yards and completed 6 of 8 passes. He did not score a touchdown.         \n\nThe Jets\u2019 unwillingness to use Tebow became a source of consternation for a fan base weary of offensive ineptitude and confused by the organization\u2019s devotion to the turnover-prone Mark Sanchez, who was ultimately benched \u2014 for the third-stringer Greg McElroy, not for Tebow. Despite the Jets\u2019 insistence in training camp on holding secret practices to install Tebow-related plays, there was never much evidence of a plan for him. He was rarely used on short-yardage and red-zone plays \u2014 the situations he was expected to be most suited for \u2014 and it took until Week 15 at Tennessee for him to get his first (and only) full series at quarterback.         \n\nAt some point, the Jets realized that Tebow, who had bulked up to 253 pounds to gird himself for special-teams duties, was more limited than they had perceived. But they had hailed his arrival so breathlessly, and with such certainty about his impact, that they could not publicly recognize their mistake \u2014 that is, until Monday, when General Manager John Idzik continued his three-month quest to address the missteps of his predecessor, Mike Tannenbaum.         \n\nThe Jets, at the time enchanted by Tebow\u2019s cost-efficient versatility and his propensity for last-minute comebacks (including one against them), thought the rewards trumped the risk of a controversy with Sanchez, who had signed a contract extension two weeks earlier.  \n Tebow joined the Jets at the height of his popularity and the zenith of his career, with flawed throwing mechanics, a passionate fan following and a sense of occasion. The first two followed him to New York, where almost all of the organization\u2019s principals \u2014 from the owner, Woody Johnson, to Coach Rex Ryan, from Tannenbaum to the deposed offensive coordinator Tony Sparano \u2014 figured in one of the more misguided and myopic moves in franchise history.         \n\nInstead of managing the situation so Tebow would have an opportunity to evolve into the \u201cmajor contributor\u201d he had predicted, Ryan watched it devolve into a fiasco, with members of the organization feeling empowered to criticize Tebow anonymously. Tannenbaum vowed that Tebow would make the Jets\u2019 offense \u201cdiverse, more dynamic\u201d and \u201cmore difficult for opposing teams to defend,\u201d when instead he made it more predictable. On his snaps at quarterback, Tebow was often asked to just run straight up the middle.         \n\nPlay-calling was the domain of Sparano, whose familiarity with the Wildcat formation and the read option obscured a lack of imagination and creativity that doomed the Jets\u2019 offense. Johnson would later say that he was only joking when he noted, \u201cYou can never have enough Tebow,\u201d but his words became an epitaph. For the Jets, apparently, never having enough Tebow is the same as having none at all.         \n\nTebow, to a degree, is not exempt from culpability. After all, he chose to accept the trade to the Jets rather than play for Jacksonville, where he grew up. But Tebow could not have predicted what awaited him in New York. The former special-teams coordinator Mike Westhoff,  \n, called the Jets\u2019 mishandling of Tebow \u201can absolute mess.\u201d         \n\nEver the diplomat, Tebow, 25, rarely revealed his emotions in public. He handled questions about the awkward predicament with Sanchez as deftly as he dealt with the attention he received for being an outspoken Christian. Only toward the end of the season, when he was passed over by Ryan for McElroy in a decision that revealed his true place on the quarterback depth chart, did Tebow offer a glimpse into the frustration that had been long simmering.         \n\nHe knew then that a departure was not only best for him but inevitable, regardless of Johnson\u2019s earlier claim that Tebow would be with the Jets for all three years of his contract. It was made all the more obvious Friday, when \n of West Virginia to raise the number of quarterbacks on their roster to six. With another potentially uncomfortable situation looming with Sanchez, the Jets finally parted ways with Tebow, informing him of his release in an early-morning meeting in Idzik\u2019s office.         \n\n\u201cWe have a great deal of respect for Tim Tebow,\u201d Ryan said in a statement. \u201cUnfortunately, things did not work out the way we all had hoped. Tim is an extremely hard worker, evident by the shape he came back in this off-season. We wish him the best moving forward.\u201d         \n\nTebow\u2019s next destination is a subject of intrigue. The Jets showed foresight in wanting to capitalize on his versatility, by lining him up at tight end, in the slot, at running back, but all Tebow wants is to play quarterback. If he is reluctant to consider a full-time position switch \u2014 and there is no telling whether such a change would be prudent \u2014 his options may be limited.         \n\nNo teams were interested when the Jets tried to trade Tebow, who will become a free agent if he clears waivers. Even the Montreal Alouettes, who own his negotiating rights in the Canadian Football League,  \n. Teams have until 4 p.m. Tuesday to register a claim and resurrect a career gone astray.
