Thank China, Rain and Pigs", "body": "\nOCILLA, Ga. \u2014 It is a meager holiday in the pecan groves of the South, and the pain is stretching to kitchens across the country.         \n\nA rare collision of ill-timed rain, marauding animals and a growing love affair between the Chinese middle class and the pecan has resulted in the worst pecan supply in recent memory. As a result, grocery store prices are up by about 30 percent, which is causing Thanksgiving bakers to think twice about their menus.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the world doesn\u2019t want us to make pralines,\u201d said Anna Butler, 24, a Texas native who lives on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.         \n\nMs. Butler has a ticket home to Texas for the holiday, so she and her New York friends celebrated an early Thanksgiving last weekend. She had planned to show off her Texan roots with a black-bottom pecan pie. But at her favorite Manhattan market, a pound of shelled pecans cost $15.99.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a real investment in a pie right there,\u201d she said.         \n\nToo much, in fact. She brought a dish of cauliflower, macaroni and cheese instead.         \n\nIn 2012, the nation\u2019s pecan orchards produced about 302 million pounds of pecans. This year, that number could drop by as much as 35 percent, according to industry officials. In Georgia, the nation\u2019s leading pecan-producing state, the crop is expected to be about half of what it was last year. In South Carolina, some orchards succumbed completely.         \n\nThe problem began with record rainfall last spring and summer. Pollination became difficult, and the moisture encouraged disease. Pecan growers sprayed their fields in record amounts, but it was not enough to fight off  \n.         \n\nIn Texas and Oklahoma, it was a summer drought that hurt the trees. Then came autumn\u2019s heavy rain, which made the ground too wet to hold the heavy equipment that shakes nuts from trees and sweeps them up.         \n\nAs a result, harvesting was sporadic, and the pecan supply was left wide open for feral pigs, which have become quite a problem in Texas, and for squirrels, which are always looking for a free nut.         \n\n\u201cThe crop faced a lot of wildlife pressure,\u201d said Blair Krebs, associate director of sales and marketing at the  \n.         \n\nThe bad nut crop has a few other causes, one of which is the cyclical nature of pecans: Typically, if one year is good, the next year is not.         \n\nLast year, for example, Texas produced about 65 million pounds of pecans, said Larry Stein, a professor of horticulture at Texas A&M University. Most estimates indicate that this year will bring no more than 35 million pounds.         \n\nThen there is China.         \n\nIn the mid-2000s, the market for pecans in China began to grow rapidly. China now consumes more than a third of the American pecan crop, a development that followed the country\u2019s inclusion in the World Trade Organization in 2001.         \n\n\u201cBefore that, they didn\u2019t know what a pecan was,\u201d said Randy Hudson, the owner of Hudson Pecan Company here in Ocilla and a vice president of the National Pecan Growers Council.         \n\nWith about 1,500 acres, Mr. Hudson\u2019s company is the largest pecan operation in Georgia. More than 90 percent of his crop goes to China, which makes him one pecan farmer who is not unhappy this Thanksgiving.         \n\n\u201cYou raised the price I get by 600 percent?\u201d he said. \u201cYou are my best friend.\u201d         \n\nIn street stalls and grocery stores in Beijing, seasoned American pecans in the shell \u2014 called \u201cbi gen guo\u201d because \u201cbi gen\u201d is supposed to sound similar to \u201cpecan\u201d \u2014 were recently selling for $7.45 a pound.         \n\nChinese shoppers prefer big varieties with thin shells, with names like Desirables and Stuarts.         \n\n\u201cThe ones that are real pretty on top of a pecan pie? Most of those have gone to export,\u201d Ms. Krebs said.         \n\nChinese processors lightly crack the shells, send the nuts through a bath of flavored water and dry roast them. The most popular flavor is called cream. Mr. Hudson says it tastes like vanilla.         \n\nThey are sold by the bagful and are particularly popular around the Chinese New Year, which is coming in January \u2014 earlier than last year, and soon enough to elbow out the Thanksgiving nut supply.         \n\nWhile that isn\u2019t good news for American bakers, it has alleviated the pain for many farmers. Although the crop is small this year, the price is well over $3 a pound at the wholesale level.         \n\nStill, that has not helped the neighborhood pickers in the Deep South who collect \u201cyard nuts\u201d from the pecan trees that grow in backyards from Atlanta to rural Texas.
