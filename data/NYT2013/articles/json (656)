{"headline": "Homeownership, the Key to Happiness?", "body": "\nIf trying to buy an apartment in  \n has been making you miserable, consider this: actually getting that home may not make you happy.         \n\nA growing body of research suggests that spending money on real estate doesn\u2019t necessarily mean investing in contentment. Indeed, the conventional advice to cut back on vacations, restaurant meals and other extras in order to save money for a home may actually be detrimental to felicity. Experts in happiness \u2014 an increasingly popular field focused on the scientific understanding of emotional well-being \u2014 say that people are happier when they spend money on experiences instead of material goods, whether it be a new car or a bigger apartment.         \n\n\u201cPeople are making so many trade-offs in order to have that home,\u201d said Elizabeth Dunn, an associate professor of psychology at the University of British Columbia who studies consumerism and happiness. She recently explored the impact of housing on people\u2019s happiness while compiling studies for a new book, \u201cHappy Money: The Science of Smarter Spending,\u201d which she wrote with Michael Norton, who teaches at the Harvard Business School.         \n\nThe recession forced many people to curb their spending habits and re-evaluate their overall lifestyles. But after saving money for years, buyers encouraged by low mortgage rates are re-entering the housing market. They find the pickings slim. In  \n, the number of apartments for sale for the second quarter was at a 13-year low, stoking competition and driving up prices.         \n\nNow there is research like Dr. Dunn\u2019s, emphasizing that when it comes to your overall happiness, \u201cthere are a lot of better things you could be putting your money toward\u201d than real estate.         \n\nThis isn\u2019t necessarily bad news in a place like New York City, where nearly 70 percent of the housing stock is rentals. And it may offer some solace to frustrated buyers facing bidding wars and all-cash offers they simply can\u2019t top.         \n\n\u201cPeople still view housing as a central component of happiness and a critical aspect of the American dream,\u201d Dr. Dunn said. \u201cBut there is little research to support that.\u201d         \n\nA 2011  \n of about 600 women in Ohio found that homeowners weren\u2019t any happier than renters. The study was conducted by Grace Wong Bucchianeri, then an assistant professor of real estate at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. Indeed, homeowners spent less time on leisure activities with friends and reported that they derived some pain from homeownership. What exactly caused that pain wasn\u2019t indicated in the study, but financial experts say that people who make the leap from renting to buying can be caught off guard by the nuts and bolts.         \n\n\u201cThe reality of maintenance and repairs, and being \u2018house rich but cash poor,\u2019 can negate much of the perceived happiness people may have had about homeownership,\u201d said Greg McBride, the senior financial analyst for  \n. Even if a low mortgage rate means you spend less each month than you did when renting, upkeep can drain a bank account faster than a leaking water heater.         \n\nWhat about the pleasure of living in a beautiful house in a coveted neighborhood? In a  \n posted in May on  \n, an online publishing site, Lindsey M. Green, a publicist for start-up and technology companies, writes about how even a lovely town house in a sought-after neighborhood can be a letdown.         \n\nMs. Green moved to New York City in 2003 and sublet what she described as a \u201ccramped, cheap, Far West Village studio.\u201d She moved eight times within Manhattan over the course of nearly 10 years, even as her friends decamped for  \n and sang its praises. \u201cI was happy as could be as the last dinosaur in Manhattan,\u201d she wrote.         \n\nIn 2011 she moved to a two-bedroom two-bath in South Street Seaport in Lower Manhattan with her then-boyfriend, now fianc\u00e9, Lockhart Steele, the founder of  \n. But in October 2012, flooding caused by  \n forced them to evacuate. So with all of the hype that Brooklyn was getting, they jumped at a six-month sublet in a newly renovated Cobble Hill town house.         \n\n\u201cI could feel all the magazine headlines becoming my reality,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAll of the \u2018Best of New York\u2019 picks in Brooklyn would suddenly make so much sense. I could become one of those people talking about how much better her life was, now that I finally made the move to Brooklyn.\u201d         \n\nShe hated it. \u201cMoving to Brooklyn, even into a four-story town house on a beautiful block, in a neighborhood everyone loves,\u201d she wrote, \u201cdidn\u2019t make our lives better; it made our quality of life worse.\u201d It didn\u2019t matter that she was living in a lovely home \u2014 she missed the bustle of Manhattan and the sense of belonging she had felt there. As she put it: \u201cManhattan \u2014 its absurd inconveniences, annoyances, high rents, crowded bars and tourist-packed streets \u2014 is my yoga.\u201d         \n\nNot everyone is crazy about Brooklyn. And at least one study suggests that the emphasis on location and physical characteristics (prewar charm, oak floors, a fabulous view) doesn\u2019t have much bearing on our overall happiness.
