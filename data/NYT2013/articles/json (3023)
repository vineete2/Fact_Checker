{"headline": "Who Says New York Is Not Affordable?", "body": "\nOne of the first things you learn when living in New York is that what qualifies as wealthy somewhere else seems barely middle-class here. On the Upper West Side, where I live, it\u2019s hard not to feel as if Manhattan is impossibly expensive for young professionals. The average nondoorman, one-bedroom apartment in the neighborhood rents for about $2,500 a month. Oatmeal-raisin cookies at Levain Bakery cost $4  \n. A pair of sensible, unstylish walking flats from Harry\u2019s Shoes can set you back $480. I suppose, by comparison, that the $198 chef\u2019s menu at Jean-Georges doesn\u2019t sound so ridiculous.         \n\nNew Yorkers assume that we live in the most expensive city in the country, and cost-of-living indexes tend to back up that assertion. But those measures are built around the typical American\u2019s shopping habits, which don\u2019t really apply to the typical New Yorker \u2014 especially not college-educated New Yorkers with annual household incomes in the top income quintile, or around $100,000. According to a recent study by Jessie Handbury, an economist at the  \n\u2019s Wharton School, people in different income classes do indeed have markedly different purchasing habits. That may not be surprising, but once you account for these different preferences, it turns out that living in New York is actually a relative bargain for the wealthy.         \n\nWhile compiling her research, Handbury looked at Nielsen shopping data for 40,000 American households, across more than 500 food categories, with details on everything from organic labeling to salt content. Remarkably, she found that for households earning above $100,000, grocery costs are 20 percent lower in cities with a high per-capita income (like New York) than in cities with a low per-capita income (like New Orleans). There\u2019s evidence that the same forces hold true for other products that cater to upper-income people, from high-end retail to beauty services. The average manicure, for example, is about $3 cheaper in New York City than in each of the rest of the top 10 biggest cities in the United States, according to Centzy, a company that collects data on the prices of services.         \n\nPart of the reason high-income residents get good deals, Handbury explains, results from a particular economic system. Highly educated, high-income New Yorkers are surrounded by equally well-educated and well-paid people with similar tastes. More vendors compete for their business, which effectively lowers prices and provides variety. There\u2019s also a high fixed cost to distributing a niche product to an area; if there\u2019s more demand for that product, then the fixed cost can be spread across more customers, which will justify bringing the product to the market in the first place. That\u2019s why companies go through the expensive hassle of distributing, say, St. Dalfour French fruit spreads in rich cities but not in poor ones and why New York can support institutions like the Metropolitan Opera.         \n\nOf course, not everything that wealthy New Yorkers spend money on is cheaper here. Housing, after all, is absurdly expensive, even for the rich. Complex zoning regulations and limited land make it all but impossible for supply to grow alongside demand. Still, it\u2019s somewhat unfair to compare housing costs here to those in a place like Buffalo, or even Atlanta, since perks like access to amenities and unusually lucrative jobs are baked into the cost of New York real estate. Yet those higher rents all but ensure that tenants will appreciate an amazing bakery or a fancy shoe store \u2014 and that retailers will have to lower prices to compete for their business. Regardless, the rent burden isn\u2019t actually as onerous as people assume: the typical resident here pays roughly the same share of her income in rent as does her counterpart in Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and Houston, according to N.Y.U.\u2019s Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy.         \n\nProfessional-class workers who like to moan about the cost of living in New York \u2014 and I\u2019m including myself in this group \u2014 don\u2019t realize how spoiled we are by both variety and competitive pricing. Truthfully, things seem more expensive here because there\u2019s just way more high-end stuff around to tempt us, and we don\u2019t do the mental accounting to adjust sticker prices for the higher quality. We see a sensible shoe with a $480 price tag or an oatmeal cookie for $4 and sometimes don\u2019t register that these are luxury versions of normal items available from Payless or Entenmann\u2019s. The problem, in part, is that people tend to anchor their own expectations for what they should buy based on what their neighbors are buying, not what some abstract, median American buys. It\u2019s a phenomenon known by some as affluenza, and it partly explains the overborrowing by the lower and middle classes during the bubble years, when their incomes were flat but their high-income neighbors\u2019 incomes were growing phenomenally.
