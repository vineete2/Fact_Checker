{"headline": "The Unlikely Chef", "body": "\nMy grandmother died when my mother was just 11 years old, and consequently my mother never learned how to cook particularly well. Certainly she had cousins and aunts who passed on bits of knowledge here and there, and she was taught to cook as part of her public education. Water, she could boil. Recipes, she could follow. But with a single father raising two young girls, my mother lost some skills along the way.         \n\nTherefore, I did not learn to cook, either. Instead I have become a superior dinner guest. I am wonderful to have at your side while you cook, particularly if you give me a glass of wine, and also to have sit at your table, because I will appreciate your food in a deep, emotional and highly verbal way, perhaps, in small part, because I did not get to experience that kind of cooking growing up.         \n\nCooking skills aside, my mother is an exceptional nurturer. Two years ago, she flew to New York from Chicago to care for me while I recovered from a minor operation. The surgery went smoothly, and the painkillers were a delight. Later, at my apartment, I handed her a grocery list of comfort foods. Included on that list was Campbell\u2019s Chicken Noodle Soup.         \n\n\u201cI should  \n you some chicken noodle soup instead,\u201d she said.         \n\n\u201cMom, you have never made me chicken noodle soup in your life \u2014 except from a can,\u201d I said.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d she said.         \n\n\u201cIt is absolutely true,\u201d I said.         \n\nWe discussed this a moment longer. Soon, a cellphone surfaced from a purse, and my father\u2019s voice came through on the end of the line.         \n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t I make chicken noodle soup when they were kids?\u201d my mother asked.         \n\n\u201cLet me talk to him,\u201d I said.         \n\n\u201cYour mother did many wonderful things for you,\u201d my father said. \u201cShe encouraged your love of books; she taught you to believe you could be anything you wanted in life.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI know she did!\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying she wasn\u2019t a great mom. But there was no chicken noodle soup, right?\u201d         \n\n\u201cI do not recall any chicken noodle soup,\u201d my father said.         \n\nI shook my head at my mother. \u201cDad says no.\u201d         \n\n\u201cWell, now I\u2019m definitely going to make you some soup,\u201d said my mother, who loves a well-thrown gauntlet.         \n\n\u201cTell her to be sure to ask for help at the grocery store,\u201d my father said.         \n\nI e-mailed my friend Kate, who is a wonderful chef. I wrote that my mom was going to make some chicken noodle soup and that perhaps this was dangerous terrain. \u201cSend us a recipe,\u201d I said. \u201cBut make it airtight.\u201d         \n\nShe sent a recipe, and off my mother went to the grocery store in search of decent chicken thighs. Meanwhile, the painkillers were wearing off. That soup better be good, I thought.         \n\nThree hours and a dozen e-mails with Kate later, my mother had successfully made the chicken broth.         \n\nThere were some arguments along the way. She bought low-sodium stock, for example, and I forced her to salt it. \u201cI\u2019m recovering from surgery,\u201d I said. \u201cLet me have my salt!\u201d But it looked good, and it smelled good. It was definitely chicken soup, and it was made with love.         \n\nAll we needed were the noodles.         \n\nI watched as my mother emptied an entire one-pound bag of noodles into the soup. Something clicked in my head. At that exact moment, Kate sent me an e-mail. Subject line: Noodles. \u201cI forgot to say how many,\u201d she wrote. \u201cDid she put in the whole package? Really, it should be like . . . a cup.\u201d         \n\n\u201cShe put them all in,\u201d I wrote back.         \n\n\u201cBut the noodles are the best part,\u201d my mother said.         \n\n\u201cThe broth is just an excuse for the noodles,\u201d Kate agreed. \u201cBut still. . . .\u201d         \n\nWe watched in horror as the noodles sucked up all the soup. We tried to add more water, but it was too late. My mother and I stood in the kitchen, frantically spooning the remaining broth into our bowls.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my fault!\u201d wrote Kate.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my fault!\u201d said my mother.         \n\nAha, the final ingredient: Guilt.         \n\nBut let me tell you, that one bowl of chicken noodle soup was delicious. We did not think about the vat of soup-soaked noodles sitting in the kitchen while we ate, nor did we think about the imperfections of life. I was my mother\u2019s best dinner guest, and she was my favorite chef.
