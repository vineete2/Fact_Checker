{"headline": "At Restaurant, Delay Is Help on Health Law", "body": "\nELLICOTT CITY, Md. \u2014 Eric King has worked diligently to keep his family\u2019s 35-year-old seafood restaurant here viable, most recently by expanding the menu beyond its well-loved crab cakes and other traditional dishes to draw a younger, freer-spending crowd.         \n\nThe restaurant, Shanty Grille, is on track to make a profit this year \u2014 about $80,000, Mr. King predicts \u2014 for the first time since the economic downturn. Yet the prospect of providing health insurance to every full-time worker or paying a penalty starting in January, a provision of the Obama health care law, has overshadowed the good news.         \n\nBusinesses with the equivalent of more than 50 full-time employees are subject to the rule, and Shanty Grille hovers right around that threshold.         \n\nThen came last week\u2019s announcement that the mandate would be delayed a year after business owners begged the Obama administration for more time. Mr. King, who had been fretting for three years about whether the restaurant would be subject to the mandate and how it would affect the bottom line, was thrilled.         \n\n\u201cIt gives us another year to plan,\u201d he said Friday, sitting in the Grille\u2019s sleek, newly expanded pub as customers cracked crabs at the bar. \u201cIf we fall below the 50, fantastic. If we\u2019re above, then we\u2019ll have another year to figure out how to offset these costs.\u201d         \n\nShanty Grille already provides health insurance to 9 of its 85 employees, paying part of the premium for each at a total cost of about $26,000 a year. The chosen group includes the restaurant\u2019s managers and chefs \u2014 skilled workers, Mr. King said, whom \u201cI really want to take care of and retain.\u201d         \n\nOthers can opt into the plan, but only if they pay the full cost, about $4,700 this year. Only one, a waitress in her 50s, has done so. (Mr. King and his wife and children are insured through a smaller family business across the street, a fish market that does not employ enough people to have to comply with the mandate.)         \n\nIf Mr. King had the equivalent of 50 full-time employees under the health care law, which uses a complex formula to determine precisely who is eligible for coverage, he estimates that would have to cover a total of 22 employees. That would bring his costs to about $62,000 a year if premiums did not rise, he said.         \n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s no return on your investment,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s not really a point anymore. I put in 70, 75 hours a week. Is it really worth it?\u201d         \n\nRestaurant owners have been among the most vocal critics of the employer mandate, saying it could hurt them more than other businesses in part because their profit margins tend to be low. Some have said they will lay off workers or shift more of them to part-time status to avoid having to comply.         \n\nMr. King thinks his current system is fair \u2014 he offers insurance to his most valuable employees, who are also the most likely to stick around \u2014 and points to low turnover as evidence that his uninsured servers, busboys, dishwashers, line cooks and hosts are content. Most are young and in good health.         \n\nHe said \u201cnot a soul\u201d among the employees at Shanty Grille had asked him to comply with the mandate.         \n\n\u201cMost of my servers are 25 to 30 years old,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019d rather take the $200 a month and put it in a bar bill as opposed to insurance.\u201d         \n\nYet at least one of Mr. King\u2019s young, uninsured employees is anxious about not having medical coverage \u2014 so much that this week, he is starting a second job that comes with health benefits. The employee, Vince Ritter, a bartender, started working at Shanty Grille a decade ago, when he was 16. The health care law allowed him to be covered under his parents\u2019 insurance plan for the last few years. But next week, when he turns 26, he will by law lose that coverage.         \n\nThat makes him nervous, he said, because he plays sports and has seen uninsured friends \u2014 including a colleague at Shanty Grille who tore a knee ligament on the basketball court \u2014 have to pay thousands of dollars for urgent care.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you, if I could have gotten it through here I probably would have just stayed,\u201d Mr. Ritter said. \u201cI love this place.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/10/us/at-restaurant-delay-is-help-on-health-law.html", "date": "2013-07-09", "description": "Restaurant owners like Eric King have been highly critical of the employer health insurance mandate, and he said the rule\u2019s delay \u201cgives us another year to plan.\u201d"}
