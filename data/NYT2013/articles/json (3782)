{"headline": "A Meshing of Talents on Every Field Goal Attempt", "body": "\nN.F.L. kickers last season attempted 1,016 field goals, each a quick, odd, almost artistic intermezzo to football\u2019s other acts of fury. The field goal \u2014 snap, hold and kick take about 1.2 seconds \u2014 happens so swiftly and with such regularity, it is often treated as an afterthought, both omnipresent and overlooked.         \n\nBut within those 1.2 seconds is a highly intricate three-part piece of performance art, a combination of quirky skills useless in any other walk of life yet essential to the prosperity of every N.F.L. team.         \n\nLike high-wire trapeze artists, the field-goal snapper, holder and kicker must seamlessly mesh their specific and unrelated talents in rapid order and in a confined space, doing so with painstaking precision time after time. Their hurried three-act drama is performed under duress with 11 agitated, snarling opponents charging from yards away and a stadium full of fans sitting in judgment, ready to boo if the kick is anything less than perfect.         \n\n\u201cThere is so much more going on than anyone sees,\u201d said Steve Weatherford, the Giants\u2019 holder. \u201cIt\u2019s dozens of moving parts with nothing left to chance because every part has been analyzed, perfected and practiced thousands of times. It happens so fast, but it usually happens so pure.\u201d         \n\nAthletic art executed in the blink of an eye.         \n\nThe Giants\u2019 field-goal corps, synchronized but never physically connected, consists of Zak DeOssie, a fifth-year snapper for field goals; Weatherford, an N.F.L. holder in his eighth season who is also the punter; and Josh Brown, a kicker in his 11th N.F.L. season. These specialists, in separate interviews, broke down the intensity of a ubiquitous but little understood football fundamental.         \n\n \n         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m always chasing the elusive perfect snap,\u201d DeOssie said last month, sitting beside the Giants\u2019 practice complex. \u201cThere is no such thing as a perfect snap in my mind.\u201d         \n\nDeOssie, whose father, Steve, was a linebacker and snapper for the Giants in the 1990s, learned to heave a football upside down and between his legs as a youngster. He has probably performed the peculiar maneuver at least 25,000 times \u2014 in his backyard and at high school, college and professional practices and games.         \n\nPerhaps 99 percent of those snaps have been serviceable enough to be caught by the holder and spotted for the kicker, but to DeOssie, none have ever been flawless.         \n\n\u201cWhen you watch thousands of them on videotape as I have, you see an inch here or an inch there that could be better,\u201d DeOssie, 29, said. \u201cMaybe they could have been a little faster or the spiral tighter.\u201d         \n\nDeOssie, who was a public policy major at Brown, understands the Sisyphean quest.         \n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s what keeps me fresh day after day,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m never complacent. It helps me deal with the idea of trying to be perfect, even if there is no perfect. It keeps me trying.\u201d         \n\nThe nearly perfect field-goal snap spins backward with the ball making two and a half revolutions from DeOssie\u2019s hands to the holder, who is kneeling 8 yards behind the snapper. Trial and error has taught DeOssie that two and a half revolutions assures that the ball will arrive at Weatherford\u2019s hands with the laces facing the sky, which makes it easier for Weatherford to catch it and immediately place it on the ground with the laces facing the goal post. If the laces do not face the target, the kicked ball can curve unpredictably.         \n\n\u201cYou can fire the ball faster, like a bullet, but it won\u2019t be two and one-half revolutions, and the laces won\u2019t arrive in the right place,\u201d DeOssie said. \u201cThen again, if you shoot it back there too slowly, the laces won\u2019t arrive in the right spot, either. It has to be the exact same tempo every time \u2014 two and one-half revolutions.\u201d         \n\nBut snapping the ball accurately with the right pace is only part of the job. He must also keep rushing linemen from blocking the kick.
