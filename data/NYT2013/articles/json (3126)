{"headline": "Gong Bao Chicken With Peanuts From \u2018Every Grain of Rice\u2019", "body": "\n \n         \n\nChinese food has been popular since Americans started going out to dinner, but cooking it at home has never quite caught on \u2014 maybe because so many Americanized Chinese restaurants still serve sweet-and-sticky or deep-fried dishes (I\u2019m looking at you, General Tso\u2019s chicken) that don\u2019t seem like good weeknight choices.         \n\nEnter  \n, a British journalist who has done more to explain real Chinese cooking to non-Chinese cooks than anyone. (It all started in the mid-1990s, when she enrolled in cooking school in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, more to improve her language skills than with the expectation of becoming a skilled cook.)         \n\nHer latest cookbook,  \nis about simple, everyday Chinese cooking, leaving no more room for excuses from American home cooks. Anyone can buy a bamboo steamer online, and tofu is available at nearly every supermarket in the country. Frankly, there isn\u2019t a faster or more healthful way of organizing weeknight dinners. (And we are not just talking about stir-fries.)         \n\nThe recipes in this book are authentic, gathered from Ms. Dunlop\u2019s travels around China, and were chosen to suit modern home cooks.         \n\nWe\u2019re going to make gong bao chicken, a pop classic with hot chiles, crunchy peanuts and plenty of garlic and ginger. Then Ms. Dunlop will join me and three Dining readers in a live video chat to discuss the recipe and Chinese cooking at home.         \n\n\u201cEveryone loves it, and it\u2019s complex enough to be interesting without being too complicated to make,\u201d Ms. Dunlop said of the gong bao chicken. \u201cPlenty to talk about.\u201d We look forward to it.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n2 boneless chicken breasts (11 to 12 ounces total), with or without skin         \n\n3 garlic cloves         \n\nAn equivalent amount of ginger         \n\n5 spring onions, white parts only         \n\nA handful of dried chiles (about 10)         \n\n2 tablespoons cooking oil         \n\n1 teaspoon whole Sichuan pepper         \n\n3 ounces (75 grams) roasted peanuts (see note)         \n\n \n         \n\n1/2 teaspoon salt         \n\n2 teaspoons light soy sauce         \n\n1 teaspoon Shaoxing wine (or use dry sherry or dry vermouth)         \n\n1 1/2 teaspoons potato starch or cornstarch         \n\n \n         \n\n1 tablespoon sugar         \n\n3/4 teaspoon potato starch or cornstarch         \n\n1 teaspoon dark soy sauce         \n\n1 teaspoon light soy sauce         \n\n1 tablespoon Chinkiang vinegar (or use balsamic vinegar)         \n\n1 teaspoon sesame oil         \n\n1 tablespoon chicken stock or water         \n\n1. Cut chicken as evenly as possible into half-inch strips, then cut strips into small cubes. Place in a small bowl. Add marinade ingredients and 1 tablespoon water to bowl. Mix well and set aside.         \n\n2. Peel and thinly slice garlic and ginger. Chop spring onions into chunks as long as their diameter (to match the chicken cubes). Snip chiles in half or into sections, discarding their seeds.         \n\n3. In a small bowl, combine the sauce ingredients.         \n\n4. Heat a seasoned wok over a high flame. Add oil, chiles and Sichuan pepper and stir-fry briefly until chiles are darkening but not burned. (Remove wok from heat if necessary to prevent overheating.)         \n\n5. Quickly add chicken and stir-fry over a high flame, stirring constantly. As soon as chicken cubes have separated, add ginger, garlic and spring onions and continue to stir-fry until they are fragrant and meat is just cooked through (test one of the larger pieces to make sure).         \n\n6. Give sauce a stir and add to wok, continuing to stir and toss. As soon as the sauce has become thick and shiny, add the peanuts, stir them in and serve.         \n\nNote: Store-bought roasted peanuts work well here, but if you want to roast your own peanuts, heat oven to 250 degrees. Place raw nuts on an oven tray and roast for 15 to 20 minutes, until fragrant and very slightly golden. (Keep an eye on them, as they are easily burned.) Cool nuts on a plate, then rub nuts between your fingertips to loosen their skins. Shake nuts as you blow over them; skins will blow away.
