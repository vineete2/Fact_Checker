But Mr. de Blasio, 52, the city\u2019s public advocate, is determined to capitalize on its ascendancy, grass-fed beef jerky and all, offering the new Brooklyn as a proxy for all the boroughs outside Manhattan, whose dynamism and energy, he argues, is woefully unmatched by their influence inside the mayor\u2019s office.         \n\n\u201cThere is a sharp understanding that the farther away you go from Manhattan, the farther you go out in concentric circles, the less your voice matters at City Hall and the less your reality is seen as important to the future of the city,\u201d he said over lunch in Prospect Heights.         \n\nHe lamented a \u201cweird, almost colonial dynamic\u201d between the glittering island of skyscrapers and the rest of the city.         \n\nThat message may prove unusually popular this year. Three of the Democratic mayoral candidates are clustered in Manhattan, creating a geographic imbalance that Mr. de Blasio is eager to exploit.         \n\nChristine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, is closely identified with the well-off Chelsea district she represents. William C. Thompson Jr., a son of Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, decamped to gentrifying Harlem five years ago. And Anthony D. Weiner, who is expected to jump into the race as soon as Wednesday, once embodied the frustrated blue-collar ethos of Forest Hills in Queens but has just abandoned that borough for Gramercy Park.         \n\n\u201cHe lives on Park Avenue in an elegant apartment,\u201d Mr. de Blasio observed dryly, as he drove through Crown Heights the other day. \u201cIt\u2019s different when you are living it now.\u201d         \n\nMr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign for mayor may be the ultimate test of Brooklyn\u2019s might. It has been 40 years since New York City sent a Brooklyn resident to Gracie Mansion \u2014 Abraham D. Beame, who was elected to a single, tumultuous term in 1973.         \n\nMr. de Blasio does not exactly fit the image of the rough-edged, hot-tempered, conservative-minded non-Manhattan candidate of yesteryear. (Think Rudolph W. Giuliani, originally from East Flatbush, who campaigned as the angry, anticrime champion of Brooklyn and Staten Island.)         \n\nBut he may not need to be. Increasingly, Brooklyn is starting to look a lot more like Mr. de Blasio and the idyllic, thoroughly gentrified Park Slope neighborhood he calls home: whiter, better educated and higher earning.         \n\nThe Park Slope-ization of central Brooklyn now seems inexorable, with demographic change even beyond immediate neighbors like Carroll Gardens, Prospect Heights and Fort Greene. From 2000 to 2011, Bedford-Stuyvesant, once written off as impossible to gentrify, absorbed about 16,800 new white residents and lost around 13,000 blacks. Nearby, the southern section of Crown Heights gained about 7,600 whites, losing 13,600 blacks, according to census data analyzed by John H. Mollenkopf, director of the Center for Urban Research at City University of New York Graduate Center.         \n\nThe new arrivals, Mr. Mollenkopf said, are reliable and active Democratic voters. \u201cThat works to Bill\u2019s benefit,\u201d he said.         \n\nLike many before them, Mr. de Blasio and his wife,  \n, sought Park Slope as a refuge \u2014 not just from sky-high real estate prices in Manhattan, but also from neighborhoods that seemed hostile to an interracial couple.
