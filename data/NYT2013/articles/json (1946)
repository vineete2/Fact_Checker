{"headline": "A World Away, the Seventh Game; Close at Hand, Condemned Nazis", "body": "\nThe Protestant minister and the Roman Catholic priest had a $10 bet riding on the 1946 World Series. The minister, a Lutheran from Missouri, went with the  \n, naturally. The priest, a Franciscan from upstate New York, was a Brooklyn Dodgers fan, but he went with the  \n to make things interesting.         \n\nThese men of the cloth had earned this minor vice.         \n\nFor the last 11 months, they had served as the chaplains at Nuremberg prison in Germany, offering spiritual counsel to the first Nazis to be tried for war crimes in the rubbed-raw wake of World War II. Among their flock were architects of genocide, responsible for the murder of many millions, most of them Jews.         \n\nNow it was mid-October, and this initial phase of postwar judgment was nearing its climactic end in a courts-and-prison complex called the Palace of Justice. The pastoral work of the Lutheran, the Rev. Henry Gerecke, and the Franciscan, the Rev. Sixtus O\u2019Connor, was almost done.         \n\nAlso ending was the 1946 baseball season, with a seventh and deciding  \n game between the Red Sox and the Cardinals to be played at Sportsman\u2019s Park in St. Louis. It was do or die.         \n\n\u201cI had two five-spots bet with the other chaplain,\u201d O\u2019Connor later recalled, in the language of Runyon, although he was also fluent in German.         \n\nThe friar, then 37, had been around. A teacher of philosophy and classical languages at Siena College, he had become antsy when the United States entered the war. He trained as a chaplain and was sent to the European campaign to join the 11th Armored Division of the Third Army, commanded by Gen. George S. Patton.         \n\nO\u2019Connor was often at the front line, ministering to the wounded and dying, and \u201cfurnishing spiritual guidance to many men suffering from mental disturbances incidental to combat.\u201d This is according to the citation for the Bronze Star that he later received and rarely mentioned.         \n\nHe was with  \n in May 1945 when it helped to liberate the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp in Austria. In little more than three weeks, he conducted burial services for 1,834 inmates at Camp Mauthausen and 1,077 inmates at Camp Gusen, and he gave last rites to more than 2,000 patients in the camp hospitals.         \n\nThe friar\u2019s Nuremberg colleague, Gerecke, 53, had also seen some things. After working among the poor and the imprisoned of St. Louis, he had been sent to Europe as a chaplain, where he attended to the war-wounded and repeatedly visited the Dachau concentration camp.         \n\nThe war had upended his family. His two oldest sons had joined the Army, with the oldest grievously injured in an accident and the second deeply affected by his experiences at the Battle of the Bulge. The minister was eager to return home, but then his commanding officer made a surprising request: Would he serve as chief chaplain to an incarcerated collection of accused Nazi war criminals?         \n\nAfter vacillation and prayer, Gerecke accepted.         \n\n\u201cHe had been to Dachau many times; he knew what these guys had done,\u201d said Tim Townsend, the author of \u201cMission at Nuremberg,\u201d a  \n about the chaplains\u2019 experience. \u201cBut to him, it was worth his time and effort to try and save as many souls as possible.\u201d         \n\nIn late 1945, the two chaplains met their congregation: 15 Protestants and 6 Catholics, including Hermann G\u00f6ring, the highest-ranking survivor of the Hitler elite; Rudolf Hess, Hitler\u2019s deputy f\u00fchrer; and Ernst Kaltenbrunner, a top leader of the SS, the paramilitary organization that oversaw, among other activities, the concentration-camp system.         \n\nKaltenbrunner was a Catholic, making him O\u2019Connor\u2019s pastoral responsibility. \u201cThere cannot be a more direct facing of evil,\u201d Townsend said, \u201cthan to liberate a concentration camp and then, weeks later, minister to the very face of the concentration camp system.\u201d         \n\nThese congregants spent their days listening to the courtroom recitation of their suspected atrocities, and their nights in the spartan cells of the prison, where the chaplains had created a cellblock chapel. It had a small altar, a crucifix, some hymnals and an organ, played by a former lieutenant colonel in the SS.         \n\nReception to the chaplains ran the spiritual gamut. Hess had no interest. Fritz Sauckel, once deeply involved in slave and forced labor operations, loved Christmas. The former field marshal Wilhelm Keitel, Hitler\u2019s military lackey, read the Bible.
