{"headline": "After Plant Explosion, Texas Remains Wary of Regulation", "body": "\nWEST, Tex. \u2014 Five days after an explosion at a fertilizer plant leveled a wide swath of this town, Gov. Rick Perry tried to woo Illinois business officials by trumpeting his state\u2019s low taxes and limited regulations. Asked about the disaster, Mr. Perry responded that more government intervention and increased spending on safety inspections would not have prevented what has become one of the nation\u2019s worst industrial accidents in decades.         \n\n\u201cThrough their elected officials,\u201d he said, Texans \u201cclearly send the message of their comfort with the amount of oversight.\u201d         \n\nThis antipathy toward regulations is shared by many residents here. Politicians and economists credit the stance with helping attract jobs and investment to Texas, which has one of the fastest-growing economies in the country, and with winning the state a year-after-year ranking as the nation\u2019s most business friendly.         \n\nEven in West, last month\u2019s devastating blast did little to shake local skepticism of government regulations. Tommy Muska, the mayor, echoed Governor Perry in the view that tougher zoning or fire safety rules would not have saved his town. \u201cMonday morning quarterbacking,\u201d he said.         \n\nRaymond J. Snokhous, a retired lawyer in West who lost two cousins \u2014 brothers who were volunteer firefighters \u2014 in the explosion, said, \u201cThere has been nobody saying anything about more regulations.\u201d         \n\nTexas has always prided itself on its free-market posture. It is the only state that does not require companies to contribute to workers\u2019 compensation coverage. It boasts the largest city in the country, Houston, with no zoning laws. It does not have a state fire code, and it prohibits smaller counties from having such codes. Some Texas counties even cite the lack of local fire codes as a reason for companies to move there.         \n\nBut Texas has also had the nation\u2019s highest number of workplace fatalities \u2014 more than 400 annually \u2014 for much of the past decade. Fires and explosions at Texas\u2019 more than 1,300 chemical and industrial plants have cost as much in property damage as those in all the other states combined for the five years ending in May 2012. Compared with Illinois, which has the nation\u2019s second-largest number of high-risk sites, more than 950, but tighter fire and safety rules, Texas had more than three times the number of accidents, four times the number of injuries and deaths, and 300 times the property damage costs.         \n\nAs federal investigators sift through the rubble at the West Fertilizer Company plant seeking clues about the April 17 blast that killed at least 14 people and injured roughly 200 others, some here argue that Texas\u2019 culture itself contributed to the calamity.         \n\n\u201cThe Wild West approach to protecting public health and safety is what you get when you give companies too much economic freedom and not enough responsibility and accountability,\u201d said Thomas O. McGarity, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law and an expert on regulation.         \n\nSince the accident, some state lawmakers began calling for increased workplace safety inspections to be paid for by businesses. Fire officials are pressing for stricter zoning rules to keep residences farther away from dangerous industrial sites. But those efforts face strong resistance.         \n\nChuck DeVore, the vice president of policy at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a conservative study group, said that the wrong response to the explosion would be for the state to hire more \u201cbattalions of government regulators who are deployed into industry and presume to know more about running the factory than the people who own the factory and work there every day.\u201d         \n\nThis antiregulatory zeal is an outgrowth of a broader Texas ideology: that government should get out of people\u2019s lives, a deeply held belief throughout the state that touches many aspects of life here, including its gun culture, its Republican-dominated Legislature and its cowboy past and present.         \n\nTexas is one of only four states with legislatures that meet as infrequently as possible, once every two years, as required by the state\u2019s 137-year-old Constitution. From the freewheeling days of independent oilmen known as wildcatters to the 2012 presidential race, in which President Obama lost Texas by nearly 1.3 million votes, the state\u2019s pro-business, limited-government mantra has been a vital part of its identity.  \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/10/us/after-plant-explosion-texas-remains-wary-of-regulation.html", "date": "2013-05-09", "description": "Last month\u2019s devastating blast in West, Tex., did little to shake local skepticism of government regulations, and recent efforts to push for more oversight have faced strong resistance."}
