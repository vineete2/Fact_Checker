{"headline": "Some Countries Lobby for More in Race for Visas", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The government of South Korea hired a former C.I.A. analyst, two White House veterans and a team of ex-Congressional staff members to help secure a few paragraphs in the giant  \n bill.         \n\nThe government of Ireland, during  \n festivities, appealed directly to  \n and Congressional leaders for special treatment. And the government of Poland squeezed Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and top lawmakers on Capitol Hill for its own favor, a pitch repeated at an embassy party last week featuring pirogi and three types of Polish ham.         \n\nThose countries, and others, succeeded in winning provisions in the fine print of the \nnow before Congress that give their citizens benefits not extended to most other foreigners.         \n\nIreland and South Korea extracted measures that set aside for their citizens a fixed number of the highly sought special visas for guest workers seeking to come to the United States. Poland got language that would allow it to join the list of nations whose citizens can travel to the United States as tourists without visas. And Canadians successfully pushed for a change that would permit its citizens who are 55 and older and not working to stay in the United States without visas for as much as 240 days each year, up from the current 182.         \n\nSouth Korea alone has four lobbying firms in the campaign, paying them collectively at a rate that would total $1.7 million this year, according to required disclosure reports. Other nations generally relied on their own ambassadors and embassy staff to make the push, meaning there is no way to track how much has been spent on the effort.         \n\nThe deals are already drawing some criticism, particularly from those who worry that some of the provisions \u2014 in addition to already increased annual visa allotments available generally \u2014 could create an influx of foreigners large enough to undermine American workers.         \n\n\u201cThis could turn into a stealth immigration policy,\u201d said Ronil Hira, a professor of public policy at the Rochester Institute of Technology who studies the immigration system. \u201cEvery country is going to try to negotiate its own carve-out.\u201d         \n\nIndeed, lawmakers are already pushing to grant special benefits to other places, including  \n,  \n and  \n.         \n\nAdvocates of the measures say they serve American interests. Loosening the tourist visa requirements, for example, would result in hundreds of thousands of additional visitors spending billions of dollars each year, supporters say.         \n\nSenator Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat who was responsible in part for inserting the measures affecting Poland, Canada and Ireland into the legislation, defends them. \u201cEach of these provisions makes individual sense on the merits,\u201d a spokesman for the senator said. \u201cThey each solve inequities in the existing immigration law.\u201d         \n\nThe proposed foreign deals have drawn little scrutiny, but Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, and his staff are starting to raise questions about some of them, saying Americans deserve to fully understand what is in the huge immigration package. \u201cI plan to ask many questions throughout this process,\u201d Mr. Grassley warned during a Senate Judiciary Committee meeting on Thursday.         \n\nSome diplomats who worked for the carefully devised benefits had hoped to avoid such attention. \u201cIf we could stay below the radar, we would much prefer it,\u201d one senior official at an embassy in Washington said on the condition of anonymity.         \n\nMost of the language in the immigration package, created by a bipartisan group of eight senators, applies equally to citizens of any foreign nation. It calls for tougher border security and a pathway to citizenship for millions of illegal immigrants in the United States. It also increases the number of visas for high-skilled workers to at least 110,000 annually from the current 65,000 and eases the way for those already here to seek a permanent resident visa, known as green card. With uncertain support in the Senate and tough opposition in the House, the fate of the bill is far from clear.         \n\nBut with access to the United States a prize coveted across much of the world, the push for special favors has been intense, according to Congressional and Justice Department records.         \n\nAn Irish-American group, working with the Irish Embassy, hired former Representative Bruce Morrison, Democrat of Connecticut, to help push its cause, arguing that changes in immigration law decades ago created an unfair barrier to citizens of Ireland in gaining access to the United States.
