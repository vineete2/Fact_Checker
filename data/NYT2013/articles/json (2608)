Ordering wine by the glass at many restaurants has always been something of a joke, at least for those who love wine. Mundane selections at outrageously high markups have generally made it more economical to order an entire bottle rather than two or three glasses, no matter how little diners planned to drink.         \n\nIn restaurants that are more serious about wine, though, by-the-glass programs have evolved at a dizzying pace in the last decade, offering customers many more choices than the ubiquitous chardonnay or pinot grigio.         \n\nWhile wines by the glass are almost never worth the markup in the strictest monetary sense, sommeliers have sought different ways to add value to the purchase. More and more restaurants now offer  \n, for example, which can help preserve young wines that may otherwise begin to decay if left in open bottles. Others find ways of selling novelty, as at Bar Boulud near Lincoln Center, where Michael Madrigale, the sommelier, features one fine wine by the glass every night poured from large-format bottles like magnums or jeroboams.         \n\nNow a new device, the  \n, has arrived that may revolutionize the sorts of wines that restaurants can make available by the glass. The Coravin seems to solve a problem that has bedeviled humanity since the first wine was stored in urns, namely, how do you preserve wine once a container is opened, exposing it to oxygen, its archenemy?         \n\nThe keg system addresses this issue, though in an ungainly way. It uses a gas like nitrogen to both push the wine from the keg to the tap and then to occupy the empty space within the keg, thereby preventing oxidation.         \n\nBut this is good only for relatively simple wines that are meant to be consumed young and can be packaged in kegs by the producers. What about fine wines that benefit from extended bottle aging?         \n\nOver the years, many systems have been tried, from the simple VacuVin, a device for pumping air out of an opened wine bottle, to complex refrigeration and preservation systems meant to extend the life of bottles once the corks have been popped. For one reason or another, none have succeeded.         \n\nEnter the Coravin, which resembles a combination microscope, drill press and pistol, and performs the neat trick of extracting wine from a bottle without actually opening it. How does it work?         \n\nA long, thin, hollow needle is inserted through the foil and cork into the bottle. Then, argon (an odorless, tasteless, harmless inert gas) is pumped through the needle, creating pressure within the bottle that pushies wine back out through the needle. When the desired amount is poured, the needle is withdrawn, leaving the argon in place of the wine, which prevents oxidation. The cork reseals itself, much like skin and tissue after an acupuncture needle is removed. It will not work on a bottle sealed by screw cap or an artificial cork.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve tasted some bottles that were opened five or six months ago with no signs of oxidation or degradation,\u201d said Thomas Pastuszak, the wine director at the NoMad in New York, which, along with a dozen or so other restaurants around the country, is using the Coravin to offer more wines by the glass.         \n\nIf the Coravin works as imagined, it can offer by-the-glass access to old and expensive wines, even if customers for these wines are few and far between. Since mid-August, when he began using the Coravin at the NoMad, Mr. Pastuszak has built a list that now includes about 30 wines that you might never expect to see sold by the glass.         \n\nWant to try a 1996 Ch\u00e2teau-Grillet, a rare and unusual white wine from the northern Rh\u00f4ne made in minute quantities? A bottle will cost you $525, but you could have a glass for a mere $110. Perhaps you are curious about what a 28-year-old Barbaresco tastes like. You could try a glass of 1985 Produttori del Barbaresco for $60 (or a bottle for $280).         \n\nThe by-the-glass prices may seem astronomical, but the price actually buys about a quarter-bottle, Mr. Pastuszak said, poured into a baby decanter in a tableside ceremony. Add in a story to tell, and you\u2019ve got a deal.
