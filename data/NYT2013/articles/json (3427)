{"headline": "And This Was Called Care? The Walter Reed Story", "body": "\nAs this week\u2019s Retro Report video explains, the biggest scandal in recent times involving the care of wounded American troops was actually worsened because medicine on the battlefront had made such remarkable advances.         \n\nCompared with service members who served in Vietnam, troops sustaining combat wounds in Iraq and Afghanistan had roughly twice the chance of surviving. That meant many were airlifted back to this country with such severe injuries they needed the most sophisticated medical and rehabilitative care the country had to offer.         \n\nBut once they became outpatients, thousands of service members entered a system that had not kept up with the times, that was understaffed, poorly organized and generally second rate.         \n\nThe story broke in The Washington Post in the winter of 2007, with a  \n While the most obvious shortcomings were the physical conditions of the hospital housing for the soldiers \u2014 peeling paint, crumbling walls, mold and rats \u2014 the more damning problem was an understaffed medical system overseen by a dysfunctional bureaucracy.         \n\nIn news media accounts and at a Congressional hearing, the No. 1 witness for the wounded was Staff Sgt. Dan Shannon of the Army, a father of three, who had served in Iraq, and, on Nov. 13, 2004, took a direct hit from an AK-47.         \n\nAs he told Retro Report: \u201cIt just missed the bridge of my nose and exited over my left ear. And it took all this bone and everything with it \u2014 and, of course, my left eye it took with it.\u201d         \n\nHe was medevaced out of Iraq, but only nine days after his near-fatal injury, the Walter Reed staff discharged him into outpatient status. What happened next is something out of  \n\u201d by Ben Fountain, the \u201cCatch-22\u201d of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.         \n\n\u201cThey gave me a Xeroxed map of the hospital grounds and it was not very well photocopied,\u201d he explains on the video. The sergeant describes roaming Walter Reed\u2019s grounds wearing only a hospital gown and robe for two hours before making it to the small room he was assigned.         \n\nThen it took him weeks to track down the nurse who was supposedly overseeing his case, as he tells Retro Report. \u201cHer comment was, \u2018Where have you been?\u2019 And I said, \u2018What do you  \n where have I been? I\u2019ve \u2014 I\u2019ve never left the hospital grounds. I\u2019m  \n I\u2019ve gone to all of my appointments.'\u201d         \n\nHer reply, he said, was, \u201cWe can see in the computer that you went to all of your appointments, but nobody knows where you are.\u201d         \n\nFrom so much bad came some good, as the military medical health care system was reorganized. But  \n is, as the video demonstrates, still not clear.         \n\nThis week\u2019s Retro Report is the 13th in a documentary series. The video project was started with a grant from Christopher Buck. Retro Report has a staff of 13 journalists and 10 contributors led by Kyra Darnton, a former \u201c60 Minutes\u201d producer. It is a nonprofit video news organization that aims to provide a thoughtful counterweight to today\u2019s 24/7 news cycle. The videos are typically 10 to 12 minutes long.
