{"headline": "How to Make an Ironman Whimper (and Cough)", "body": "\nWhen you watch the  \n from the start of last February\u2019s Empire State Building Run-Up, an 86-story stair race, one man stands out. Thomas Dold, a 28-year-old German wearing Bib No. 1, is already a few inches ahead when the starting horn blasts. His shins are canting into a run, and with his left arm he\u2019s pushing at the chest of a runner to that side of him. A split second later, his right arm juts up to block more runners.         \n\nAll around Dold, the racers are wincing, for what\u2019s coming is harsh. There are 1,576 steps ahead of them, 10 to 12 minutes of suffering. And before that, less than 10 yards from the start, there\u2019s a door to get through. It\u2019s standard size, 36 inches wide, and everyone, Dold especially, wants to be the first one there. The jockeying is desperate. In 2009, Suzy Walsham, an Australian, was shoved into the wall next to the door. \u201cThe impact was so great,\u201d she says, \u201cthat I initially thought I had broken my nose and lost teeth.\u201d She fell and was trampled before she rose and ran on to victory. \u201cI get super nervous and anxious whenever I start\u201d at the Empire State Building, says Walsham, who has won the women\u2019s division three times and will be one of about 650 competitors at this year\u2019s race, which takes place Feb. 6. \u201cI really dread the start.\u201d         \n\nWhat the racers may dread even more, however, is the sight of Thomas Dold dashing up the stairs two at a time, yanking along on the railings. Dold has won Empire State (known as Esbru among the stair-racing community) a record seven consecutive times. He is the only person in the world who makes a living at stair racing (his sponsors include a German health care company), which makes him the lord of an obscure but nonetheless codified sport. According to the World Cup rankings on  \n, Dold finished 2012 in first place, with 1,158 points, 157 more than the runner-up, Piotr Lobodzinski of Poland. Four hundred of those points came from his victory at Esbru, tower racing\u2019s unofficial world championships, and its oldest contest, dating to 1978. Another 156 stair races, held in 25 nations, generate World Cup points as well.         \n\nDold also sits atop the Vertical World Circuit, a championship tour of eight celebrated races \u2014 among them, Esbru \u2014 and he is a minor celebrity on YouTube. In one clip, you can see a smiling Dold sprinting stadium steps at a photo shoot for a print ad. In another video, from the Corrida Vertical, a 28-story dash in S\u00e3o Paulo, the announcer cracks, \u201cA shortcut to win the race is break Dold\u2019s legs . . . or giving him some sleeping pills.\u201d Dold wins and, as he crosses the finish line, still running, peels off his plain white race jersey to reveal a sleek undershirt emblazoned with his Web address,  \n.         \n\nIn New York last year, Dold may have gotten away with a false start; the video is fairly incriminating. \u201cI was moving before the start,\u201d he told me recently. But then, he said, he caught himself and stopped. So he was actually at a disadvantage, he said, \u201cmoving backward when the others are moving forward.\u201d         \n\nIn interviews, Dold is chipper and exudes supreme confidence. \u201cI can run backward faster than most people can run forward,\u201d he boasts. (He is in fact one of the world\u2019s premier backward runners, having completed a heels-first mile in 5:46, a world record.) At times, he lapses into the third person, like a major-sports star, or Donald Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s all about beating Dold,\u201d he told a German reporter not long ago, summing up the stair-racing world. \u201cThat\u2019s the goal for hundreds of participants.\u201d         \n\n \n stair races happen in Europe and Asia. A tiny cadre of die-hards \u2014 roughly a dozen men and three or four women \u2014 travel the globe chasing minuscule cash prizes\u00ad. The largest single prize, in Taipei, is less than $7,000. Esbru offers no prize money. The race sites are often architecturally significant: the Messeturm tower in Basel; the Palazzo Lombardia in Milan; the Swiss\u00f4tel in Singapore, designed by I. M. Pei. \u201cThere\u2019s something very elemental about climbing an iconic building,\u201d says Sproule Love, a New Yorker who has finished third at the Empire State Building three times. \u201cYou can survey the area and see how far you have come.\u201d         \n\nStill, the stair racers don\u2019t experience architecture so much as stairwells. I assumed their races are characterized by a mind-numbing sameness, but Walsham assured me I was wrong. \u201cSome stairwells turn to the left,\u201d she said. \u201cSome turn to the right. Sometimes the stairs are shallow, sometimes they\u2019re steep. And the number of floors always varies.\u201d         \n\nWalsham, who works in Singapore as a manager for a computer-security firm, spent about $12,000 traveling to races last year. In the United States, a small contingent of stair climbers are shelling out similar sums to get to the 100 or so American races offered each year. When I went to Los Angeles recently, for the 51-story Climb for Life race, I met Daniel Dill, who flew in from Texas, happy to pay the $50 entry fee and the requisite $100 donation to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation for a race that would take him less than 13 minutes. Dill, a large man dressed in articulated-toe sneakers, brought with him a special warm-up tool, an Elevation Training Mask. It was designed for Mixed Martial Arts fighters, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to stimulate red blood cells and open up the lungs.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/magazine/stair-racing-a-sport-to-make-an-ironman-whimper.html", "date": "2013-01-25", "description": "The race to the top of very tall buildings."}
