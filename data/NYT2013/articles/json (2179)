{"headline": "Poor Black and Hispanic Men Are the Face of H.I.V.", "body": "\nThe AIDS epidemic in America is rapidly becoming concentrated among poor, young black and Hispanic men who have sex with men.         \n\nDespite years of progress in preventing and treating H.I.V. in the middle class, the number of new infections nationwide remains stubbornly stuck at 50,000 a year \u2014 more and more of them in these men, who make up less than 1 percent of the population.         \n\nGiselle, a homeless 23-year-old transgender woman with cafe-au-lait skin, could be called the new face of the epidemic.         \n\n\u201cI tested positive about a year ago,\u201d said Giselle, who was born male but now has a girlish hair spout, wears a T-shirt tight across a feminine chest and identifies herself as a woman. \u201cI don\u2019t know how, exactly. I was homeless. I was escorting. I\u2019ve been raped.\u201d         \n\n\u201cYes, I use condoms,\u201d she added. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to lie. I slip sometimes. Trust me \u2014 everyone here who says, \u2018I always use condoms\u2019? They don\u2019t always.\u201d         \n\nBesides transgender people like Giselle, the affected group includes men who are openly gay, secretly gay or bisexual, and those who consider themselves heterosexual but have had sex with men, willingly or unwillingly, in shelters or prison or for money. (Most of those interviewed for this article spoke on the condition that only their first names be used.)         \n\nNationally, 25 percent of new infections are in black and Hispanic men, and in New York City it is 45 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the city\u2019s health department.         \n\nNationally, when only men under 25 infected through gay sex are counted, 80 percent are black or Hispanic \u2014 even though they engage in less high-risk behavior than their white peers.         \n\nThe prospects for change look grim. Critics say little is being done to save this group, and none of it with any great urgency.         \n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t even an ad campaign aimed at young black men until last year \u2014 what\u2019s that about?\u201d said Krishna Stone, a spokeswoman for GMHC, which was founded in the 1980s as the Gay Men\u2019s Health Crisis.         \n\nPhill Wilson, president of the  \n in Los Angeles, said there were \u201cno models out there right now for reaching these men.\u201d         \n\nFederal and state health officials agreed that it had taken years to shift prevention messages away from targets chosen 30 years ago: men who frequent gay bars, many of whom are white and middle-class, and heterosexual teenagers, who are at relatively low risk. Funding for health agencies has been flat, and there has been little political pressure to focus on young gay blacks and Hispanics.         \n\nReaching those men \u201cis the Holy Grail, and we\u2019re working on it,\u201d said Dr. Jonathan Mermin, director of H.I.V. prevention at the C.D.C. His agency created its  \n campaign \u2014 the one Ms. Stone referred to \u2014 and has granted millions of dollars to local health departments and community groups to pay for testing.         \n\nBut he could not name a city or state with proven success in lowering infection rates in young gay minority men.         \n\n\u201cWith more resources, we could make bigger strides,\u201d he said.         \n\n \n         \n\nGay black youths are hard to reach, experts say. Few are out to their families. Many live in places where gays are stigmatized and cannot afford to move. Few attend schools with gay pride clubs or gay guidance counselors.         \n\n\u201cWhen we talked about H.I.V. in sex ed, the class started freaking out,\u201d said Alex, 20, who was born in St. Croix but raised in New York. \u201cOne guy said, \u2018We ain\u2019t no faggots; why do we have to learn this stuff?\u2019 So the teacher stopped and moved on to another topic.\u201d         \n\nWhen those who are poor and homeless go to traditional gay hangouts, they become prey.         \n\nKwame, a 20-year-old from Philadelphia, said that on his first day wandering around New York last year, he was propositioned by an older homeless man and by an older transgender person. The homeless man later admitted that he was infected, and added: \u201cIf you sit here long enough, you\u2019re going to get some propositions \u2014 and that\u2019s where you\u2019re going to sleep tonight. It happened to me, and it\u2019s going to happen to you.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/05/us/poor-black-and-hispanic-men-are-face-of-hiv.html", "date": "2013-12-04", "description": "The number of new H.I.V. infections nationwide remains stubbornly stuck, with more and more occurring in young black and Hispanic men."}
