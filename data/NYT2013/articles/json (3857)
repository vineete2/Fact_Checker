{"headline": "Staying Private on the New Facebook", "body": "\n \n is a personal vault that can contain photos of your firstborn, plans to bring down your government and, occasionally, a record of your indiscretions.         \n\nIt can be scoured by police officers, partners and would-be employers. It can be mined by marketers to show tailored advertisements.         \n\nAnd now, with Facebook\u2019s newfangled search tool, it can allow strangers, along with \u201cfriends\u201d on Facebook, to discover who you are, what you like and where you go.         \n\nFacebook insists it is up to you to decide how much you want others to see. And that is true, to some extent. But you cannot entirely opt out of Facebook searches. Facebook, however, does let you fine-tune who can see your \u201clikes\u201d and pictures, and, to a lesser extent, how much of yourself to expose to marketers.         \n\nThe latest of its frequent changes to the site\u2019s privacy settings was made in December. Facebook is nudging each of its billion subscribers to review them.         \n\nThe nudge could not have been more timely, said Sarah Downey, a lawyer with the Boston  \n, which markets tools to help users control their visibility online. \u201cIt is more important than ever to lock down your Facebook privacy settings now that everything you post will be even easier to find,\u201d she said.         \n\nThat is to say, your settings will determine, to a large extent, who can find you when they search for women who buy dresses for toddlers or, more unsettling, women who jog a particular secluded trail.         \n\nWhat can you do? Ask yourself four simple questions.         \n\n \n How would you like to be found?         \n\nGo to \u201cwho can see my stuff\u201d on the upper right side of your Facebook page. Click on \u201csee more settings.\u201d By default, search engines can link to your timeline. You can turn that off if you wish.         \n\nGo to \u201cactivity log.\u201d Here you can review all your posts, pictures, \u201clikes\u201d and status updates. If you are concerned about who can see what, look at the original privacy setting of the original post.         \n\nIn my case, I had been tagged eating a bowl of ricotta with my fingers at midnight near Arezzo. My friend who posted the picture enabled it to be seen by anyone, which means that it would show up in a stranger\u2019s search for, I don\u2019t know, people who eat ricotta with their fingers at midnight. I am tagged in other photos that are visible only to friends of the person who posted them.         \n\nThe point is, you want to look carefully at what the original settings are for those photos and \u201clikes,\u201d and decide whether you would like to be associated with them.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get this Facebook thing either,\u201d said one woman whose friend request I had accepted in January 2008. \u201cBut everyone in our generation seems to be on it.\u201d         \n\nIf you are concerned about things that might embarrass or endanger you on Facebook \u2014 Syrians who endorse the opposition may not want to be discovered by government apparatchiks \u2014 comb through your timeline and get rid of them. The only way to ensure that a post or photo is not discovered is to \u201cunlike\u201d or \u201cdelete\u201d it.         \n\nMake yourself a pot of tea. This may take a while. The nostalgia may just be amusing.         \n\n \n What do you want the world to know about you?         \n\nGo to your profile page and click \u201cAbout me.\u201d Decide if you would like your gender, or the name of your spouse, to be visible on your timeline. Think about whether you want your birthday to be seen on your timeline. Your date of birth is an important piece of personal information for hackers to exploit.         \n\nA tool created a couple of weeks ago by a team of college students offers to look for certain words and phrases that could embarrass other college students as they apply for internships and jobs. It is  \n, formerly Facewash, and it looks for profanity, references to drugs and other faux pas that you do not necessarily want, say, a law school admissions officer to see.         \n\nSocioclean is  \nthat scours your Facebook posts. It is selling its service to college campuses to offer to students.         \n\n \nDo you mind being tracked by advertisers?         \n\nFacebook has eyes across the Web; \n found that its so-called widget \u2014 the innocuous blue letter \u201cf\u201d \u2014 is integrated into 20 percent of the 10,000 most popular Web sites. If that is annoying, several tools can help you block trackers. Abine,  \n  \n offer browser extensions. Once installed on your Web browser, these extensions will tell you how many trackers they have blocked.         \n\nFacebook also has a mechanism to show you ads based on the Web sites you have visited. It works with third-party companies to place cookies on my computer when, for instance, I visit an e-commerce site. That brand knows that I might be looking at girls\u2019 dresses. It can ask Facebook to show me an ad for girls\u2019 dresses when I log in to Facebook. You can control this. Hover over the \u201cX\u201d next to the ad and choose from the drop-down menu: \u201cHide this ad,\u201d you could say. Or hide all ads from this brand. Facebook does not serve the ads itself, so to opt out of certain kinds of targeted ads, you must go to the third party that Facebook works with to show ads based on the Web sites you have browsed.         \n\n \n Whom do you want to befriend?         \n\nNow is the time to review whom you count among your Facebook friends. Your boss? Do you really want her to see pictures of you in Las Vegas? And the woman you met in Lamaze class: do you want the apps she has installed to know who you are?         \n\n \n, a browser extension, shows you how to keep your friends\u2019 Facebook applications from sucking you into their orbit. It is preparing to introduce a tool to control what it calls your \u201cexposure\u201d to the Facebook search engine.         \n\n \n offers a similar feature. Depending on your privacy settings, that photo-sharing app that your Lamaze compatriot just installed could, in one click, know who you are and have access to all the photos that you thought you were sharing with \u201cfriends.\u201d         \n\nOne of Facebook\u2019s cleverest heists is the word \u201cfriend.\u201d It makes you think all your Facebook contacts are really your \u201cfriends.\u201d They may not be.
