{"headline": "Costly Rents Push Brooklynites to Queens", "body": "\nIt was only a matter of time, after Bushwick was given a featured role in the HBO show \u201cGirls,\u201d that the young creative types who established this gritty  \n neighborhood as an artists\u2019 enclave began to be priced out.         \n\nGalleries, restaurants and bars have multiplied in Bushwick. Rachel and Kurt of Fox Television\u2019s \u201cGlee\u201d moved into a loft there. Last September, the Clintons were spotted at  \n, the artisanal pizzeria. More recently, Anne Hathaway was reported to be filming a scene for a movie at a local cafe and music joint. And developers have homed in with plans for doorman buildings, and possibly a mall.         \n\nNow, with such mainstream endeavors looming and prices on the rise, artists, 20-somethings and young families are taking the L train for the short hop to neighboring and more economical Ridgewood,  \n.         \n\nThe average monthly rent for a studio in Bushwick was $1,675 in July, up 27 percent from July 2011, according to MNS, a residential and investment sales brokerage. The monthly rent for one- and two-bedroom apartments was also up by double digits, to $1,900 and $2,121 respectively, for the same period.         \n\nThe price increases come as the gap narrows between overall rents in northern Brooklyn and  \n. Last month, the average monthly rent in northern Brooklyn rose to $3,035 \u2014 by 8.2 percent compared with July 2012, according to a report compiled by the appraisal firm Miller Samuel for Douglas Elliman. In Manhattan, the average rent was $3,822 in July, up 1.7 percent.         \n\nAt the same time, developers are looking for a better return on rental buildings as they face rising land prices in Manhattan. \u201cWe\u2019re getting a lot of these landlords who historically have been in Manhattan saying, \u2018Tell us about Bushwick; what is this area in Queens?\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Andrew Barrocas, the chief executive of MNS. He has organized about a dozen informal walking tours of the area for investors and developers who want a better understanding of the buzz.         \n\nCompared with Manhattan, he said, \u201cthe rent multiplier is a lot more appealing,\u201d because of lower land costs and the premium that new rentals can command.         \n\nTen years ago, a two-bedroom priced at $1,100 a month would have been on the high side in Bushwick, said  \n, who represents the area stretching from Williamsburg and Bushwick in Brooklyn into Ridgewood, Queens, on the New York City Council. \u201cToday we\u2019re talking about people who are charging $3,000\u201d to roommates who split the rent four ways.         \n\nShe noted that seven rezoning proposals had been submitted in her district, and that she was pushing for developments to set aside 40 percent of apartments as affordable housing. She added that when one of her staff members, who is moving for the third time in two years because of rising Bushwick rents, heard about this article, he lamented, \u201cNow I\u2019m going to have to move again.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\nReal estate prices in Ridgewood, a working-class neighborhood of roughly two square miles, are on the upswing. But monthly rents are still cheaper than in East Williamsburg and Bushwick. For example, the rent for a three-bedroom in Ridgewood is nearly 20 percent lower than in Bushwick, according to  \n.         \n\nRidgewood consists mainly of well-maintained row houses from the early 20th century, between two and six stories high. The median sales price in the second quarter was $400,000, up 14 percent from the same period last year, according to Streeteasy.         \n\nAlex Amini, a 24-year-old bass player, is paying just $600 a month to share a large three-bedroom duplex in a renovated Ridgewood row house with four other people. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest apartment I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d he said, \u201cand it\u2019s the cheapest.\u201d         \n\nHe charts his eastward progression over the past four years, starting in Manhattan, where he paid $1,100 a month for a share in a three-bedroom in the East Village. After a brief detour to the Upper West Side, he went through a series of sublets, all with roommates, all costing $700 to $800 a month, near the Morgan Avenue L subway stop \u2014 a burgeoning area called variously Morgantown, Bushwick and East Willamsburg.         \n\n\u201cI made some really close friends,\u201d Mr. Amini said of his time living with \u201crandom people\u201d in Brooklyn. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the allure.\u201d         \n\nRidgewood is quiet by comparison. \u201cThere are not a lot of restaurants,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not as much of a hotbed for artists yet.\u201d         \n\nBut there are signs of gentrification. Notable among the handful of galleries and coffee shops is Bunker, a Vietnamese restaurant headed up by Jimmy Tu, who once cooked at Eleven Madison Park. It was recently named the  \n by New York magazine.         \n\nEven as bright-orange umbrellas shade a new pedestrian plaza where Myrtle Avenue, 71st Avenue and Stephen Street converge, a shop like Ridgewood Coins and Stamps remains straight out of another era, advertising an old-fashioned telephone exchange beginning with the letters EV. Others have signs that reflect the German, Mexican, Polish and other immigrants who make up the community.         \n\nBut a few are clearly catering to a new demographic. ChocoLatte Caf\u00e9, a year-old coffee shop a storefront away from Ridgewood Coins and Stamps, has cards at the door promoting a local yoga studio with student specials. A block away,  \n has an oversize chandelier, fake lotus flowers floating in pots and a Mod aesthetic.         \n\n\u201cMany of the young people who work in Williamsburg \u2014 bartenders, waitresses \u2014 if you ask them where do they live, they say Ridgewood,\u201d said Gene Keyser, a broker with Halstead Property in Brooklyn. \u201cIt\u2019s the young folks, east of Fort Greene, the Pratt kids, finding themselves priced out, who are now pushing out there.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/realestate/costly-rents-push-brooklynites-to-queens.html", "date": "2013-08-16", "description": "With prices rising in Bushwick, nearby Ridgewood is tempting some to cross the borough border."}
