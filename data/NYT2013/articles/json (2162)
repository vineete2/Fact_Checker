{"headline": "House Votes to Extend Gun Law Without New Provisions for 3-D Printed Firearms", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The House voted on Tuesday to extend  \n banning firearms that can pass undetected through airport X-ray machines, but left out provisions that law enforcement officials say are necessary to combat the growing threat of guns made with 3-D printers.         \n\nThe legislation was approved overwhelmingly on a voice vote, meaning House members on both sides of a politically fraught gun-safety issue avoided having their individual votes officially recorded.         \n\nThe focus now shifts to the Senate, where Democrats will introduce a stricter measure of their own next week, along with the extension the House passed.         \n\nBut they are expected to act on Monday, the day the law expires. That leaves little time for senators to debate the more controversial aspects of the legislation, which would impose new restrictions on 3-D printed weapons.         \n\nSenators who want to go beyond the current law believe the most likely outcome is that they will pass the 10-year extension next week so the law does not lapse and then return to the issue sometime next year, Democratic aides said.         \n\n\u201cThe House bill is a step in the right direction, but it doesn\u2019t get us across the finish line,\u201d said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, who is part of a group of Democrats pushing the Senate to take a harder line. \u201cA few years ago, these undetectable plastic guns were science fiction. Now, they\u2019re frighteningly real.\u201d         \n\nOpponents of expanding the current law argue that 3-D printed guns are expensive to make and unreliable to fire, and so not worth regulating.         \n\nBut law enforcement agencies, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, say the proliferation and improvement of 3-D printing technology, along with the falling cost of the machines that make it possible, have created a very real security threat. The bureau tested a 3-D printed gun that it assembled from designs downloaded online and found it capable of firing multiple metal .380-caliber bullets.         \n\nIn the past, renewing the Undetectable Firearms Act, as the law is known, has been a largely noncontroversial move. It first passed in 1988 and was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan; Congress has renewed it twice since.         \n\nBut this time,  \n in the fraught politics of gun control in the Capitol. Democrats in the Senate tried to renew it before the Thanksgiving recess with a simple one-year extension, hoping they could use the coming year to pass the 3-D printing provisions.         \n\nAs the law is currently written, manufacturers of 3-D printed guns are only required to make their firearms detectable to security screeners in some way, usually by including some form of metal. But some designers have made that metal piece nonfunctional and easily removable.         \n\nTo close the loophole in the current law, the changes proposed by Democrats would require that an essential, nondetachable piece of the gun be made of a sufficient quantity of metal to be picked up in a security screening.
