{"headline": "Home Buyers Seek Manhattan Wrecks", "body": "\nFor people scrambling to make their way in the real estate market, there are many routes, and one of the most adventurous involves buying what brokers often describe as wrecks (fixer-upper is the more diplomatic term). An anemic inventory combined with increasing reluctance to shell out huge sums of money for other people\u2019s taste is sending a growing number of buyers to places they can redo to their own liking, right down to the shape of the kitchen island and the color of the bathroom tile.         \n\nThese buyers willingly shoulder the often formidable financial and emotional costs of stripping a place to the studs and rebuilding it so as to end up with exactly the sort of home they want and may save money along the way.         \n\nReal estate brokers and analysts report a significant uptick in Manhattan in the number of buyers seeking properties in need of major overhaul, alert for such tipoff phrases as \u201cbring your contractor and your imagination.\u201d         \n\nAccording to Jonathan J. Miller, the president of Miller Samuel, the real estate appraisal firm, an analysis of sales of properties rated as \u201cwrecks\u201d or in \u201cfair\u201d or \u201cpoor\u201d condition jumped 40 percent between the fourth quarter of 2011 and the same period in 2012. Between those two Decembers, the increase was a hefty 83 percent, indicating soaring desire for such properties at year\u2019s end.         \n\nAs for the limited inventory driving this trend, \u201cthe listing of properties in Manhattan fell 34 percent from the fourth quarter of 2011 to the same period last year, the lowest level we\u2019ve tracked in more than 12 years,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cSo we\u2019re seeing more creative and flexible buyers who are faced with a lack of choices as inventory remains tight. As a result, we\u2019ve seen an increase in sales of places in poor condition \u2014 a k a wrecks.\u201d         \n\nSome real estate firms, among them Corcoran and Brown Harris Stevens, let prospective buyers zero in on needy properties by searching for terms like \u201cwreck,\u201d \u201cestate sale\u201d and \u201cfixer-upper.\u201d         \n\nIn December the online firm RealDirect.com created a search engine that allows users to check what it called its \u201cunrenovated\u201d option, a collection of listings with phrases like \u201cneeds work.\u201d This search engine was installed after company surveys indicated that 10 percent of prospective buyers said they would consider a home in need of renovation.         \n\n\u201cThere are always buyers who want places they can put their mark on and don\u2019t want to pay for someone else\u2019s renovation,\u201d said Doug Perlson, RealDirect\u2019s chief executive officer. \u201cAnd in the last few months, with inventory so light, especially for middle-of-the-road buyers, we\u2019re seeing more appetite for these properties. Buyers are seeing an upside to purchasing a home where they can both get a better deal and start from scratch.\u201d         \nLaura Jacobs and James Wolcott have at last moved from the \u201cbefore\u201d to the \u201cafter\u201d stage of the extensive renovation they undertook of their new home on Riverside Drive. \n\n \n         \n\n \n likes to say that she and her husband,  \n, took the plunge because of the death of a cat, Jasper, at 15 the oldest of the couple\u2019s three ocicats. Jasper, long beset with health problems, died in October 2011, and within a week, Ms. Jacobs was online looking for properties. \u201cThe death released us so we could make a change,\u201d she said. \u201cIt freed us, both emotionally and practically.\u201d         \n\nTo be sure, financial considerations also played a key role for Ms. Jacobs, a novelist and dance critic, and her husband, a cultural critic for Vanity Fair. The couple, married for nearly two decades, lived in a Classic 6 in a Rosario Candela building on West 108th Street, and money was a growing concern.         \n\n\u201cWe had a huge mortgage that never seemed to budge because we kept refinancing,\u201d Ms. Jacobs said. \u201cPlus the maintenance had risen considerably, and there were assessments on top of that. People think writers earn a lot, but we were strapped.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/17/realestate/home-buyers-seek-manhattan-fixer-uppers.html", "date": "2013-03-15", "description": "Real estate brokers and analysts report a significant uptick in the number of people seeking fixer-uppers."}
