{"headline": "How Well Does Contemporary Fiction Address Radical Politics?", "body": "\nEach week in Bookends, two writers take on pressing and provocative questions about the world of books. This week, Pankaj Mishra and Jennifer Szalai discuss the representation of extreme political ideas in fiction.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \nPankaj Mishra \n\nIn the 1930s, many politically engaged writers in the West were engrossed by Andr\u00e9 Malraux\u2019s \u201cConquerers\u201d and \u201cMan\u2019s Fate,\u201d both set amid the turmoil of the Chinese Revolution. Malraux was one of the first novelists to reckon with two new 20th-century realities: the revolt of the masses and the power of ideology. Aligned with working-class movements, his smart, self-aware characters made the conspirators of Joseph Conrad\u2019s \u201cUnder Western Eyes\u201d and Henry James\u2019s \u201cPrincess Casamassima\u201d seem like petty and irrelevant hecklers of an imperturbable bourgeois order. But Malraux still found himself attacked by Leon Trotsky, who said the French novelist was too much of a bourgeois individualist, and not Marxist enough to comprehend the great events he was part of.         \n\nAn equivalent accusation was brought against many writers engaged with the energies, both liberationist and nihilist, released by anticolonial movements and the arduous process of state-building in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Fortunately, these breakers of long national silences (including Indonesia\u2019s Pramoedya Ananta Toer and Chile\u2019s Roberto Bola\u00f1o) were less compelled by Marxist dogma than by the nobility of individual passion for justice and dignity. The antiapartheid activists of Nadine Gordimer\u2019s \u201cBurger\u2019s Daughter,\u201d the Trotskyist revolutionary of Mario Vargas Llosa\u2019s \u201cReal Life of Alejandro Mayta\u201d and the low-caste opponent of Communist government in Arundhati Roy\u2019s \u201cGod of Small Things\u201d show how the wish for radical innovation has been diversely realized, and often corrupted, but never less than urgent.         \n\nThis longing for an alternative order could not have been similarly commemorated in post-World War II American fiction. While other countries struggled with genocides, military coups and economic calamities, the United States saw an unprecedented period of prosperity, nearing what Carl Schmitt called a state of \u201cneutralization\u201d: the end of struggles between rival ideologies and systems, and the rise of a politics dominated by experts and mass persuaders.         \n\nWriting as the clamorous protests of the 1960s faded away, Philip Roth seemed almost envious of writers in Communist Eastern Europe, who had gained moral prestige and authority through their perilous defiance of repressive governments: \u201cThere,\u201d he wrote, \u201cnothing goes and everything matters; here everything goes and nothing matters.\u201d         \n\nThe American novelist\u2019s unease about his comfortable isolation, frequently expressed through reflexive irony, rarely flowed into an empathetic understanding of those intractably embodying the will to change at home. In \u201cAmerican Pastoral,\u201d Roth himself seemed to equate political radicalism with a form of lunacy. The vicious attacks of Sept. 11 could only strengthen the tendency to see militant dissent as a species of pathology.         \n\nConfronted with the facts of mass politics and ideological fervor, John Updike and Martin Amis psychologized them away as symptoms of sexual frustration. Presumably free of male anxieties, fiction by women \u2014 Deborah Eisenberg, Jennifer Egan, Susan Choi, Barbara Kingsolver, Ann Patchett, Dana Spiotta \u2014 has seemed much more sensitive to the variety, ambiguities and contradictions of radical thought and action. (Depicting Robespierre in \u201cA Place of Greater Safety,\u201d Hilary Mantel may have given us contemporary fiction\u2019s richest portrait of a revolutionary.) Remarkably, almost all events and characters in these works are drawn from the past. But then the few people pushed to radical gestures in our own era of unparalleled conformity and political passivity are more likely to be scorned than admired.
