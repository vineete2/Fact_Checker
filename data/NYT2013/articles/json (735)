{"headline": "Math Behind Leak Crackdown: 153 Cases, 4 Years, 0 Indictments", "body": "\nSoon after  \n appointed him director of national intelligence in 2009,  \n called for a tally of the number of government officials or employees who had been prosecuted for leaking national security secrets. He was dismayed by what he found.         \n\nIn the previous four years, the record showed,  \n to the Justice Department. Not one had led to an indictment.         \n\nThat scorecard \u201cwas pretty shocking to all of us,\u201d Mr. Blair said. So in a series of phone calls and meetings, he and Attorney General  \n fashioned a more aggressive strategy to punish anyone who leaked national security information that endangered intelligence-gathering methods and sources.         \n\n\u201cMy background is in the Navy, and it is good to hang an admiral once in a while as an example to the others,\u201d said Mr. Blair, who left the administration in 2010. \u201cWe were hoping to get somebody and make people realize that there are consequences to this and it needed to stop.\u201d         \n\nThe Obama administration has done its best to define those consequences, with an aggressive focus on leaks and leakers that has led to more than twice as many prosecutions as there were in all previous administrations combined. It also led to  \n on Friday when a federal appeals court accepted the Justice Department\u2019s argument that the First Amendment does not protect reporters from having to reveal the sources suspected of leaking information to them.         \n\nIn tracing the origins of this effort, present and former government officials said the focus on leaks began at the administration\u2019s highest levels and was driven by pressure from the intelligence agencies and members of Congress.         \n\nAn unprecedented cascade of disclosures, including hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables made public by WikiLeaks, according to these officials, gave the search for leakers a growing sense of urgency, while technological advances made the job of finding them easier. And prosecutors \u2014 until recently \u2014 were given more latitude to comb through journalists\u2019 records to hunt for suspects.         \n\nThe charges filed last month  \n, the former National Security Agency contractor now holed up in a Moscow airport, are the seventh leak-related prosecution brought by the Justice Department. And the department\u2019s next case may be aimed at just the kind of top-level target that Mr. Blair said he had hoped for: James E. Cartwright, a retired general who was vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff until August 2011. General Cartwright has been identified as a focus of an investigation into the disclosure of classified information about American-led cyberattacks on  \n.         \n\nSupporters of the crackdown \u2014 even those with qualms about seeking evidence from journalists \u2014 say a culture of leaking must be reined in to protect covert sources and high-risk intelligence operations and reassure allies that it is safe to share intelligence.         \n\n\u201cSomebody finally said this has got to stop,\u201d said John D. Negroponte, a former diplomat and director of national intelligence under George W. Bush. \u201cMaybe if there are more prosecutions, it will.\u201d         \n\nBut critics argue that the Cartwright case, and now the appeals court ruling, show how the antileak campaign has gone too far, producing a chilling effect on news gathering without deterring leakers. Mr. Snowden has said he was inspired by the deeds of Pfc. Bradley Manning, who is facing a court-martial after divulging the diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks.         \n\n\u201cI think it has gotten away from them,\u201d said Morton H. Halperin, who served in national security or diplomatic positions in three previous administrations. \u201cIf the president doesn\u2019t fix this, I think his claim that he understands the importance of balancing the First Amendment against claims of national security will lack any credibility.\u201d         \n\nImplicitly at least, Mr. Holder seemed to acknowledge some of the criticism this month when he  \n longstanding  \n on seeking evidence from journalists. He said those restrictions \u201cwill help ensure the proper balance is struck when pursuing investigations into unauthorized disclosures.\u201d         \n\nMr. Holder\u2019s move came in response to a torrent of criticism after the revelations this spring that prosecutors had secretly subpoenaed the phone logs for more than 20 phone lines of The Associated Press in one leak inquiry and two days of phone logs of a Fox News reporter, James Rosen, in another investigation aimed at a State Department adviser, Stephen Jin-Woo Kim. Prosecutors also obtained a court-ordered search warrant for Mr. Rosen\u2019s e-mails by identifying him as a criminal co-conspirator of Mr. Kim\u2019s.         \n\nBut Mr. Holder\u2019s conciliatory message was seemingly undermined by the Justice Department\u2019s success in overturning a lower court\u2019s ruling that a reporter for The New York Times, James Risen, had a First Amendment right to refuse to reveal his sources in the trial of a former C.I.A. analyst, Jeffrey Sterling. Mr. Sterling was charged in 2010 with disclosing classified information to Mr. Risen about a covert operation to deceive Iranian scientists described in Mr. Risen\u2019s 2006 book, \u201cState of War.\u201d         \n\nMr. Risen has previously vowed to go to jail to protect his sources.\u00a0 On Saturday he said in a statement, \u201cI remain as resolved as ever to continue fighting.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/us/politics/math-behind-leak-crackdown-153-cases-4-years-0-indictments.html", "date": "2013-07-20", "description": "The Obama administration\u2019s aggressive focus on leaks has led to more than twice as many prosecutions as there were in all previous administrations combined."}
