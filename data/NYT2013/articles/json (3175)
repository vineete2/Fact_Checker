The other side of the bracket, the Boston Red Sox versus the Detroit Tigers, will begin Saturday. Do you have tickets to any of the games?         \n\nBefore the modern convenience of buying tickets with the smartphone in your palm \u2014 or, before that, the phone attached to the wall \u2014 you often had to work to see postseason baseball.

Or wait on hold for five hours only to be told the game was sold out?  \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/12/sports/baseball/whos-on-line-first.html", "date": "2013-10-11", "description": "October baseball is known to be extremely competitive, even for its fans, who, through the years, have vied for good World Series tickets."}
