{"headline": "Poised to Enter a Convent, Then She Fell in Love", "body": "\n \n         \n\nBob and Carol Kelly met in Durham, N.C., where Bob worked for the Environmental Protection Agency and Carol was doing a medical residency at Duke. Today they live in Ardsley, N.Y., and have been married 31 years. Bob continues to work for the E.P.A. as an air pollution meteorologist, while Carol is a geriatric care physician. The couple have three adult children. An edited and condensed version of our conversation follows.         \n\n \n         \n\nCarol: I was a second-year medical resident. We were in the same Catholic Young Adults Group and connected at a conference we attended to represent our parish.         \n\nBob: She ended up getting in an intense conversation with another member who was conflicted about becoming a priest or a doctor, and stood me up.         \n\nBob: We had dinner many times at her house and would just talk and talk. There were things she would say that spoke to me; things that I was listening for in my life; some religious, some not.         \n\nCarol: The residency program was 43 people and 3 were women, so a lot of my social life was with men. I considered myself one of the guys. I didn\u2019t realize until a mutual friend told me that Bob seemed to have a different perception of our relationship.         \n\n \n         \n\nCarol: I was planning on entering the convent. When our friend told me that Bob thought we were dating, it led to a conversation and Bob told me that he was pretty certain that I had a different call to vocation.         \n\nBob: I told her that maybe she had been praying and maybe the answer was me. Our relationship got a lot more serious after that.         \n\n \n         \n\nBob: She was shocked, but it opened up deeper conversations about what she wanted.         \n\nCarol: I finally opened my eyes. I came to understand, why every time I had almost gone into the convent something came up. I have lived out my service differently than I had envisioned, through my job as a physician first in the Bronx and now in geriatric care.         \n\n \n         \n\nCarol: Confused. I was 27, so a child I was not. But I had been thinking of entering the religious community since I was 15, and my father had strongly objected. It had to do with what he perceived as the second-class citizen status of nuns. And from early on, my faith community felt that it was not good to go against my family\u2019s wishes, so I postponed. Then right at the time my parents were beginning to accept it, we announced we were going to be engaged. The appearance of our first child a year after our wedding made things easier.         \n\nBob: It wasn\u2019t because they didn\u2019t like me; they just didn\u2019t understand. When I asked for her hand, he just said, \u201cGo ahead.\u201d That was it.         \n\n \n         \n\nBob: Fun. We talked out the options about child care, but when our first was born we didn\u2019t want that, so I stayed home. I worked it out so that I went in just one day a week. But after eight months they were going to give my job away so I went back.         \n\nCarol: I was in the National Health Service Corps, but when my service was completed I worked part time and worked less than most physicians. I was committed to having more time with the children and all of us being together in the evenings.         \n\n \n         \n\nCarol: Some of our tough times related to our responsibility to the children, and we were also caring for my mother who had dementia. In every relationship there will be an enforcer and the parent who they think they can get away with things. There were times when I felt a lot of stress about being the enforcer.         \n\nBob: I fell into the old masculine mindset of child rearing, that the house and kids were Carol\u2019s responsibility. I was inattentive. It is tough raising kids when you are working full time.         \n\nCarol: We passed on to the kids that service is very important and I\u2019m proud that they are very community minded. I think that is the biggest thing we have instilled.         \n\nBob: Catholicism for us has been a unifying force. We were involved in our local parish, but we would drive to the next parish over because it was more ethnically diverse, which was important for our kids.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/booming/poised-to-enter-a-convent-then-she-fell-in-love.html", "date": "2013-09-06", "description": "Carol and Bob Kelly have weathered storms by communicating and staying committed, and they find they\u2019re \u201cbetter when we are together.\u201d"}
