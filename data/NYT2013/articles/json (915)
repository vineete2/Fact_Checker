{"headline": "Spies Infiltrate a Fantasy Realm of Online Games", "body": "\nNot limiting their activities to the earthly realm, American and British spies have infiltrated the fantasy worlds of World of Warcraft and Second Life, conducting surveillance and scooping up data in the online games played by millions of people across the globe, according to newly disclosed classified documents.         \n\nFearing that terrorist or criminal networks could use the games to communicate secretly, move money or plot attacks, the documents show, intelligence operatives have entered terrain populated by digital avatars that include elves, gnomes and supermodels.         \n\nThe spies have created make-believe characters to snoop and to try to recruit informers, while also collecting data and contents of communications between players, according to the documents, disclosed by the former  \n contractor Edward J. Snowden. Because militants often rely on features common to video games \u2014 fake identities, voice and text chats, a way to conduct financial transactions \u2014 American and British intelligence agencies worried that they might be operating there, according to the papers.         \n\nOnline games might seem innocuous, a top-secret 2008 N.S.A. document warned, but they had the potential to be a \u201ctarget-rich communication network\u201d allowing intelligence suspects \u201ca way to hide in plain sight.\u201d Virtual games \u201care an opportunity!\u201d another 2008 N.S.A. document declared.         \n\nBut for all their enthusiasm \u2014 so many C.I.A., F.B.I. and Pentagon spies were hunting around in Second Life, the document noted, that a \u201cdeconfliction\u201d group was needed to avoid collisions \u2014 the intelligence agencies may have inflated the threat.         \n\nThe documents, obtained by  \n and shared with The New York Times and ProPublica, do not cite any counterterrorism successes from the effort. Former American intelligence officials, current and former gaming company employees and outside experts said in interviews that they knew of little evidence that terrorist groups viewed the games as havens to communicate and plot operations.         \n\nGames \u201care built and operated by companies looking to make money, so the players\u2019 identity and activity is tracked,\u201d said Peter W. Singer of the Brookings Institution, an author of \u201cCybersecurity and Cyberwar: What Everyone Needs to Know.\u201d \u201cFor terror groups looking to keep their communications secret, there are far more effective and easier ways to do so than putting on a troll avatar.\u201d         \n\nThe surveillance, which also included Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Live, could raise privacy concerns. It is not clear exactly how the agencies got access to gamers\u2019 data or communications, how many players may have been monitored or whether Americans\u2019 communications or activities were captured.         \n\nOne American company, the maker of World of Warcraft, said that neither the N.S.A. nor its British counterpart, the Government Communications Headquarters, had gotten permission to gather intelligence in its game. Many players are Americans, who can be targeted for surveillance only with approval from the nation\u2019s secret intelligence court. The spy agencies, though, face far fewer restrictions on collecting certain data or communications overseas.         \n\n\"We are unaware of any surveillance taking place,\" said a spokesman for Blizzard Entertainment, based in Irvine, Calif., which makes World of Warcraft. \"If it was, it would have been done without our knowledge or permission.\"\u00a0         \n\nA spokeswoman for Microsoft declined to comment. Philip Rosedale, the founder of Second Life and a former chief executive officer of Linden Lab, the game\u2019s maker, declined to comment on the spying revelations. Current Linden executives did not respond to requests for comment.         \n\nA Government Communications Headquarters spokesman would neither confirm nor deny any involvement by that agency in gaming surveillance, but said that its work is conducted under \u201ca strict legal and policy framework\u201d with rigorous oversight. An N.S.A. spokeswoman declined to comment.         \n\nIntelligence and law enforcement officials became interested in games after some became enormously popular, drawing tens of millions of people worldwide, from preteens to retirees. The games rely on lifelike graphics, virtual currencies and the ability to speak to other players in real time. Some gamers merge the virtual and real worlds by spending long hours playing and making close online friends.
