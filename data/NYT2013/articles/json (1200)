{"headline": "A.D.H.D. Experts Re-evaluate Study\u2019s Zeal for Drugs", "body": "\nTwenty years ago, more than a dozen leaders in child psychiatry received $11 million from the  \n to study an important question facing families with children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: Is the best long-term treatment medication, behavioral therapy or both?         \n\nThe widely publicized result was not only that medication like Ritalin or Adderall trounced behavioral therapy, but also that combining the two did little beyond what medication could do alone. The finding has become a pillar of pharmaceutical companies\u2019 campaigns to market A.D.H.D. drugs, and is used by insurance companies and school systems to argue against therapies that are usually more expensive than pills.         \n\nBut in retrospect, even some authors of the study \u2014 widely considered the most influential study ever on A.D.H.D. \u2014 worry that the results oversold the benefits of drugs, discouraging important home- and school-focused therapy and ultimately distorting the debate over the most effective (and cost-effective) treatments.         \n\nThe study was structured to emphasize the reduction of impulsivity and inattention symptoms, for which medication is designed to deliver quick results, several of the researchers said in recent interviews. Less emphasis was placed on improving children\u2019s longer-term academic and social skills, which behavioral therapy addresses by teaching children, parents and teachers to create less distracting and more organized learning environments.         \n\nRecent papers have also cast doubt on whether medication\u2019s benefits last as long as those from therapy.         \n\n\u201cThere was lost opportunity to give kids the advantage of both and develop more resources in schools to support the child \u2014 that value was dismissed,\u201d said  \n, a child psychiatrist and professor at Ohio State University and one of the principal researchers on the study, known as the  \n         \n\nAnother co-author,  \nof McGill University in Montreal, added: \u201cI hope it didn\u2019t do irreparable damage. The people who pay the price in the end is the kids. That\u2019s the biggest tragedy in all of this.\u201d         \n\nA.D.H.D. narrowly trails asthma as the most frequent long-term medical diagnosis in children.  \nchildren in the United States receive a diagnosis of the disorder by the time they turn 18, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At least 70 percent of those are prescribed stimulant medication like Adderall or Concerta because, despite potential side effects like insomnia and appetite suppression, it can quickly mollify symptoms and can cost an insured family less than $200 a year.         \n\nComprehensive behavioral (also called psychosocial) therapy is used far less often to treat children with the disorder largely because it is more time-consuming and expensive. Cost-conscious schools have few aides to help teachers assist the expanding population of children with the diagnosis, which in some communities reaches 20 percent of students. Many insurance plans inadequately cover private or group therapy for families, which can cost $1,000 a year or more.         \n\n\u201cMedication helps a person be receptive to learning new skills and behaviors,\u201d said Ruth Hughes, a psychologist and the chief executive of the advocacy group  \n. \u201cBut those skills and behaviors don\u2019t magically appear. They have to be taught.\u201d         \n\nAccepting no support from the pharmaceutical industry \u2014 \u201cto keep it clean,\u201d Dr. Arnold said \u2014 the National Institute of Mental Health gathered more than a dozen top experts on A.D.H.D. in the mid-1990s to try to identify the best approach. Over 14 months, almost 600 children with the disorder ages 7 to 9 across the United States and Canada received one of four treatments: medication alone, behavioral therapy alone, the combination, or nothing beyond whatever treatments they were already receiving.         \n\n \n, published in 1999, concluded that medication \u201cwas superior to behavioral treatment\u201d by a considerable margin \u2014 the first time a major independent study had reached that conclusion. Combining the two, it said, \u201cdid not yield significantly greater benefits than medication\u201d alone for symptoms of the disorder.         \n\nIn what became a simple horse race, medication was ushered into the winner\u2019s circle.         \n\n\u201cBehavioral therapy alone is not as effective as drugs,\u201d ABC\u2019s \u201cWorld News Now\u201d reported. One medical publication said, \u201cPsychosocial interventions of no benefit even when used with medication.\u201d         \n\nLooking back, some study researchers say several factors in the study\u2019s design and presentation to the public disguised the performance of psychosocial therapy, which has allowed many doctors, drug companies and schools to discourage its use.
