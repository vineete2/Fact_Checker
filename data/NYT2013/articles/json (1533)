{"headline": "Robbed at Gunpoint, Some Bronx Victims Resist", "body": "\nThe first armed robbery attempt was in October, on a residential Bronx block near an elevated train stop. The victim fought back. He was shot in the leg.         \n\nThe next came a month later and roughly a mile away. Once again, the victim resisted and was shot.         \n\nAfter the third robbery attempt, in February, two distinct patterns became apparent. The police suspected a single group was to blame, a group that cruised in cars and attacked lone men at night. But a more unusual pattern was seen among the three victims: when faced with a gun and a straightforward proposition \u2014 your money or your life \u2014 they had opted to take their chances with their lives.         \n\n\u201cBeing held at gunpoint, for some people, is not that scary,\u201d said Brian Melford, 21, a Bronx youth activist and student at  \n. \u201cAround here, people think they\u2019re strong. They just say, \u2018I\u2019m not going to give it up.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nCriminologists have for decades studied the responses of victims to violent crime. Robberies in particular became a topic of scholarly research in the 1980s and 1990s, as random street crime spread through urban areas, with those studies mostly confirming the obvious: if you resist a robber, you are more likely to get hurt or, possibly, killed.         \n\n\u201cFrom any perspective of rationality, the thing to do with a robber is to cooperate politely,\u201d said Franklin E. Zimring, a criminologist at  \n. But, he added, both robbers and recalcitrant victims have never been the most rational actors.         \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have much money on you; it\u2019s nuts for the victim to refuse,\u201d he said. \u201cHere\u2019s the second layer of nuts: You\u2019ve got a rational robber. If the victim refuses, why doesn\u2019t he just find somebody else?\u201d         \n\nNational victim surveys in more recent years suggest little change in the number of people standing up to their muggers, or even a slight decrease.         \n\nBut with decade-long declines in crime, some scholars have noted a change in the nature of robberies. A 2009 study of national victim surveys taken since 1993 found that not only were robberies becoming less frequent over time, they were also becoming more violent, in part because of what the authors describe as \u201cvictim hardening.\u201d         \n\n\u201cSofter victims take precautions,\u201d said Rajiv Sethi, a Barnard College economist and one of the study\u2019s authors. In addition, he said, many people who may have become robbers in the past may instead have gotten jobs as urban economies improved, leaving the more-hardened criminals to encounter more-hardened victims on the streets of certain neighborhoods.         \n\n\u201cYou get more resistance in high-crime areas than low-crime areas,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople who would not resist have left the areas. Those who stay can\u2019t afford to leave or to give up the little property that they have in their possession.\u201d         \n\nThe general perception of bad guys may have changed as well. Decades ago, many harbored an understandable fear that a gun-wielding assailant, fueled by drugs or desperation, would shoot at the smallest provocation. But a spreading sense of safety in many areas of the city, fostered by the falling murder rate, may lead some to doubt that a gunman these days will pull the trigger.         \n\n\u201cIt does sound plausible that when you have less of a climate of fear, you have more resistance,\u201d said Mr. Sethi, though he cautioned that research has not been conducted in this area.         \n\nIn the Bronx, ballistics tests last month matched a 9-millimeter handgun from the first two botched robberies to the one in February, also on a deserted residential street in the middle of the night. In that case, too, the 31-year-old victim held on to his valuables \u2014 and was shot in the leg.         \n\nAnother attempted armed robbery, in December, involved a different weapon but the same behavior by the assailants. It was not certain that the same men were responsible for that shooting, said Paul J. Browne, the Police Department\u2019s chief spokesman, but the reaction of the 28-year-old victim matched the others: \u201cTough guys who said, No, I\u2019m not giving up my stuff.\u201d         \n\nNone of the attempted robberies resulted in any property being taken, Mr. Browne said. \u201cThey\u2019re batting a thousand in their lack of success,\u201d he said.
