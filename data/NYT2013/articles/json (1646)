{"headline": "Getting Started With Blueberry Jam", "body": "\n \n         \n\nJam is the best starter recipe for anyone who wants to begin canning. And at this time of year, who doesn\u2019t? I chose this month\u2019s recipe, from Kevin West\u2019s book  \n because I\u2019ve always wondered why good blueberry jam is so hard to find, and because the season for wild blueberries is in full flush. (Also, good blueberries are now available all year.)         \n\n\u201cBlueberries are tough,\u201d is the first thing that Mr. West told me, and it turned out to be an echo of the practical approach and frank tone of his book, which contains both simple formulas and more sophisticated recipes like cocktail onions and peach-passionfruit jam. He has deep roots in the South but has lived in Southern California since 2004, working as the West Coast editor for W magazine.         \n\nThe flavor of blueberries resides almost completely in their purple skins, full of compounds called terpenes. They have what Mr. West calls \u201cpiney, citrusy, fresh\u201d qualities, but they cook off quickly, which is why blueberry pies and jams so often taste sweet and nothing else. Terpenes are also found in juniper, pine, cinnamon and limes, so he devised a recipe that adds lime juice and zest after cooking. This brings back the sweet-tart balance of the berries.         \n\nTry the jam, then join our video chat on canning, and jams, preserves and jellies.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n3 pounds blueberries, stemmed and rinsed         \n\n3 cups sugar         \n\n1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice         \n\n1 3-inch cinnamon stick         \n\nJuice and zest of 1 lime         \n\n1. Prepare four 1/2-pint jars: Wash jars, lids and rings in hot, soapy water and rinse well. Place jars in a 200-degree oven until needed. Put lids in a pan of boiling water, and cover until needed.         \n\n2. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot or canning bath. (Or put down a layer of lid rings.) Add enough water to cover jars by 2 to 3 inches (do not put jars in yet) and bring to a boil, then reduce heat. The water will need to be at about 180 degrees \u2014 a whispering boil \u2014 when jars are added for processing. Place two small saucers in freezer.         \n\n3. In a large saucepan, gently heat berries with 1/2 cup water until they burst their skins. Remove pan from heat, let cool slightly, and run berries through the coarse blade of a food mill.         \n\n4. Return pur\u00e9e to pan. Add sugar, lemon juice and cinnamon stick. Cook at a full boil, stirring constantly, until a gel set is achieved, 8 to 10 minutes; mixture will look jammy. To test, drop a teaspoon of the mixture onto a chilled saucer. Put in freezer for 1 minute. Push your finger through jam. If surface wrinkles, it is ready. (If not, cook a few minutes more and repeat with second saucer.) Discard cinnamon stick. Stir in lime juice and zest.         \n\n5. Ladle hot jam into jars, leaving 1/4-inch head space to allow contents to expand. Run a skewer or other thin tool around the jars\u2019 inside edges to release bubbles or air pockets. Wipe rims clean with a damp paper towel, put flat lids in place, and screw on rings just until tight.         \n\n6. Using a jar lifter or tongs, lower sealed jars into water bath. Cover and rapidly bring water to a full rolling boil. Once water is boiling, boil jars for 10 more minutes.         \n\n7. Turn off heat and remove jars from water bath. Place on a cutting board or folded dish towel and leave overnight.         \n\n8. The next morning, verify that jars have sealed. Remove ring and press on center of lid. If the lid moves, or if the \u201cbutton\u201d in the center flexes, the seal has failed to set. The jam is still safe to eat, but it is not suitable for shelf storage; put it in the refrigerator and use it first. Store sealed jars in a cool, dark place for up to 1 year. Refrigerate after opening.
