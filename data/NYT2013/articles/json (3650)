{"headline": "Turmoil in Cyprus\nOver a Bailout\nRattles Europe", "body": "\nNICOSIA, Cyprus \u2014 Europe\u2019s surprising decision early Saturday to force bank depositors in Cyprus to share in the cost of the latest euro zone bailout set off increasing outrage and turmoil in Cyprus on Sunday and fueled fears that the trouble will spread to countries like Spain and Italy.         \n\nFacing eroding support, the new president,  \n, asked Parliament to postpone until Monday an emergency vote on a measure to approve the bailout terms, amid doubt that it would pass. The euro fell sharply against major currencies ahead of the action, as investors around the world absorbed the implications\u00a0of Europe\u2019s move.         \n\nIn an address to the nation, Mr. Anastasiades painted an apocalyptic picture of what would happen if Cyprus did not approve the strict terms: a \u201ccomplete collapse of the banking sector\u201d; major losses for depositors and businesses; and a possible exit of Cyprus from the euro zone, the 17 countries that use the euro as their currency.         \n\nHe said he was working to persuade European Union leaders to modify their demands for a 6.75 percent tax on deposits of up to 100,000 euros, a move that would hit ordinary savers.         \n\n\u201cI understand fully the shock of this painful decision,\u201d he said, speaking with a grim look on his face as he stood between the Cypriot and European Union flags in the presidential palace. \u201cThat is why I continue to fight so that the decisions of the Eurogroup will be modified in the coming hours.\u201d The  \n is made up of the 17 euro zone finance ministers.         \n\nBy size, Cyprus\u2019s economy represents not even half a percent of the combined output of the 17 euro zone countries. Yet the impact of this weekend\u2019s decision by European leaders to impose across-the-board losses on bank depositors \u2014 from the richest Russian oligarchs, who have increasingly deposited their money in Cyprus\u2019s banks, to the poorest Cypriot pensioners \u2014 in return for 10 billion euros, or $13 billion, in bailout money could not be more far-reaching.         \n\nAfter five years of bailouts financed largely by European taxpayers, wealthy European nations have decreed that when a bank or country goes broke, bond investors and perhaps even bank depositors will pay a significant portion of the bill.         \n\nThe change is driven in no small part by the growing reluctance by residents of nations like Germany \u2014 whose chancellor, Angela Merkel, faces an election this year \u2014 to continue to finance bailouts of troubled neighbors like Greece, Portugal, Italy, Spain, and now Cyprus. The resulting turmoil could create a wave of investor contagion that will challenge Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, to make good on his promise to do  \n to protect the euro.         \n\nOn Sunday, it was clear that a majority of Cyprus\u2019s 56 lawmakers would not approve the terms of the bailout, which would lead to a likely loss of the rescue money that Cyprus so desperately needs.         \n\nThe government extended a bank holiday it had imposed over the weekend, meaning banks will not open Tuesday as planned. There was talk that they might not open Wednesday, either.         \n\nIn response, the European Central Bank applied more pressure to have the deal approved, sending two representatives to Cyprus on Saturday night to assure Cypriot banks that the central bank was \u201chere for them \u2014 as long as the bill goes through Sunday or Monday morning before financial markets in Europe open,\u201d said Aliki Stylianou, a press officer for the central bank of Cyprus.         \n\nMr. Anastasiades\u2019s cabinet gathered early Sunday with the heads of the central bank and the finance ministry to discuss how to carry out the levy, should it pass.         \n\nBut some analysts expressed skepticism about the measure\u2019s long-term effects even if Cyprus approves it.         \n\n\u201cWhether the Parliament approves the measure or not, the effect will be the same,\u201d said Stelios Platis, the managing director of MAP S.Platis, a financial services firm, and a former economic adviser to Mr. Anastasiades. \u201cAs soon as banks in Cyprus reopen, people will rush to take all their money out\u201d because they do not believe it will not happen again.         \n\nTo some degree, this policy shift was foreshadowed last month when Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the finance minister for the Netherlands who was recently tapped to lead the Eurogroup, forced investors of a failing Dutch bank to pay their share by writing down 1.8 billion euros\u2019 worth of high-risk bonds to zero.         \n\nBut it is one thing to wipe out bond investors and quite another to force a loss on bank depositors, including Cypriot savers who had their deposits insured and, like people all over the world, had the impression that a government-backed savings account was inviolable.         \n\nThis is the first time depositors have taken a loss in a euro-zone rescue, said Adam Lerrick, a sovereign debt expert at the American Enterprise Institute, who has long argued that debt-heavy countries in Europe must make private investors, including bank depositors if need be, share the cost of bank bailouts. \u201cIt prevented the insolvency from being transferred from the banking system to the government,\u201d he said.         \n\nWhile such a notion may please the financial hard-liners, it carries significant financial risks.         \n\nIndeed, as many stunned Cypriots  \n to remove their savings, Europe had to confront the prospect that savers in Spain and particularly in Italy \u2014 where cash-poor banks have been hit hard by loan losses \u2014 would do the same.         \n\nPublic officials in Spain and Italy did their best over the weekend to say that the situation in Cyprus was unique and that deposits in those countries \u2014 especially Spain, which experienced a period of  \n last year \u2014 remained safe.
