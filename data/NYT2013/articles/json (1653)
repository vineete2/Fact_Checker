{"headline": "Unease at Clinton Foundation Over Finances and Ambitions", "body": "\nSoon after the 10th anniversary of the foundation bearing his name,  \n met with a small group of aides and two lawyers from Simpson Thacher & Bartlett. Two weeks of interviews with Clinton Foundation executives and former employees had led the lawyers to some unsettling conclusions.         \n\nThe review echoed criticism of Mr. Clinton\u2019s early years in the White House: For all of its successes, the Clinton Foundation had become a sprawling concern, supervised by a rotating board of old Clinton hands, vulnerable to distraction and threatened by conflicts of interest. It ran multimillion-dollar deficits for several years, despite vast amounts of money flowing in.         \n\nAnd concern was rising inside and outside the organization about Douglas J. Band, a onetime personal assistant to Mr. Clinton who had started a lucrative corporate consulting firm \u2014 which Mr. Clinton joined as a paid adviser \u2014 while overseeing the Clinton Global Initiative, the foundation\u2019s glitzy annual gathering of chief executives, heads of state, and celebrities.         \n\nThe review set off more than a year of internal debate, and spurred an evolution in the organization that included Mr. Clinton\u2019s daughter, Chelsea, taking on a dominant new role as the family grappled with the question of whether the foundation \u2014 and its globe-spanning efforts to combat AIDS, obesity and poverty \u2014 would survive its founder.         \n\nNow those efforts are taking on new urgency. In the coming weeks, the foundation, long Mr. Clinton\u2019s domain since its formation in 2001, will become the nerve center of  \n\u2019s increasingly busy public life.         \n\nThis fall, Mrs. Clinton and her staff will move into offices at the foundation\u2019s new headquarters in Midtown Manhattan, occupying two floors of the Time-Life Building. Amid speculation about her 2016 plans, Mrs. Clinton is adding major new initiatives on women, children and jobs to what has been renamed the  \n.         \n\nWorried that the foundation\u2019s operating revenues depend too heavily on Mr. Clinton\u2019s nonstop fund-raising, the three Clintons are embarking on a drive to raise an endowment of as much as $250 million, with events already scheduled in the Hamptons and London. And after years of relying on Bruce R. Lindsey, the former White House counsel whose friendship with Mr. Clinton stretches back decades, to run the organization while living part-time in Arkansas, the family has hired a New York-based chief executive with a background in management consulting.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to institutionalize the foundation so that it will be here long after the lives of any of us,\u201d Mr. Lindsey said. \u201cThat\u2019s our challenge and that is what we are trying to address.\u201d         \n\nBut the changing of the guard has aggravated long-simmering tensions within the former first family\u2019s inner circle as the foundation tries to juggle the political and philanthropic ambitions of a former president, a potential future president, and their increasingly visible daughter.         \n\nAnd efforts to insulate the foundation from potential conflicts have highlighted just how difficult it can be to disentangle the Clintons\u2019 charity work from Mr. Clinton\u2019s moneymaking ventures and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s political future, according to interviews with more than two dozen former and current foundation employees, donors and advisers to the family. Nearly all of them declined to speak for attribution, citing their unwillingness to alienate the Clinton family.         \n\n \n         \n\nLast Thursday, Mr. Clinton arrived two hours late to an exuberant welcome at a health clinic about 60 miles north of Johannesburg. Children in zebra-striped loincloths sang as Mr. Clinton and Ms. Clinton made their entrance, and the former president enthusiastically explained how his foundation had helped the South African government negotiate large reductions in the price of drugs that halt the progress of HIV. Aaron Motsoaledi, South Africa\u2019s minister of health, heaped praise on the effort. \u201cBecause of your help we are able to treat three and a half times more people than we used to,\u201d he told the crowd.         \n\nThe project is typical of the model pioneered by the Clinton Foundation, built around dozens of partnerships with private companies, governments, or other nonprofit groups. Instead of handing out grants, the foundation recruits donors and advises them on how best to deploy their money or resources, from helping Procter & Gamble donate advanced water-purification packets to developing countries to working with credit card companies to expand the volume of low-cost loans offered to poor inner city residents.
