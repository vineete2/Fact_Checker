{"headline": "Twitter Shows Its Rude Side", "body": "\nWhat accounts for the galloping lushness of bad manners on  \n? A recent incident may shed some light.         \n\nWhen Bill Clinton appeared on Stephen Colbert\u2019s television show in early April, Mr. Colbert expressed surprise that he didn\u2019t have a Twitter feed. Mr. Clinton said he didn\u2019t tweet because he\u2019s \u201csort of insecure.\u201d So Mr. Colbert set up an account ( \n) and had the former president dictate his first tweet to him. Mr. Clinton added that he was worried he would attract no followers, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing worse than a friendless tweeter, right?\u201d (He needn\u2019t have worried: an hour after the episode was broadcast, he had 20,000 followers.)         \n\nMy point: if a household name capable of instantly drawing a crowd is concerned about looking like a loser on Twitter, think of the burden felt by the average Joe. In a milieu rife with self-promotion and self-branding, the inevitable byproduct is insecurity. Insecurity is to bad manners as boat travel is to nausea.         \n\nI joined Twitter in February to give myself a daily deadline for writing jokes. But soon the demon of success started breathing fire in my ear. \u201cI don\u2019t have enough followers,\u201d I soon started thinking. \u201cI need to twitter-blitz or to set fire to a small dog.\u201d I felt as if I had shown up at the Oscars in a tux by Giorgio Armandi.         \n\nThe first piece of wisdom I gleaned was unanticipated. Namely, Twitter fact-checkers are an unforgiving bunch. In March, shortly after Senator Rob Portman of Ohio reversed his position on gay marriage because he has a gay son, I wrote the tweet, \u201cSenator Rob Portman doesn\u2019t have another son who\u2019s poor and 87 and in need of health care, does he?\u201d         \n\nWhen Andy Richter, the actor and writer best known as Conan O\u2019Brien\u2019s sidekick, re-tweeted the joke to his 452,000 or so followers, one response I received was a veritable tasting menu of bad Twitter manners, combining as it did fact-checking (one) with undermining (two) and blame (three). The response ran, \u201can 87 year old son?  \n made that same joke, only funny. thanks for nothing  \n.\u201d Trifecta!         \n\nBut the most egregious expressions of insecurity on the site, of course, are nasty comments. If Twitter is an excellent shopping mall full of boutiques offering specialized news and wit and opinion, it is also a crowded barroom that bristles with a certain kind of white male rage.         \n\nThis rage, marked by a hostility toward anything poetic or na\u00efve, reaches its full expression in the comments directed at Jose Canseco\u2019s feed, a highly pleasing outpouring of slightly oddball, gnomic pronouncements. When Mr. Canseco, the baseball player, wrote, \u201cI have blown up bigger engines than the diesel,\u201d one of his followers wrote, \u201cJose, I think you\u2019re an absolute moron.\u201d Mr. Canseco\u2019s tweet \u201cnorth korea do the math\u201d drew \u201cI\u2019m also very familiar with mental illness.\u201d         \n\nBut you don\u2019t have to wield a cudgel to exhibit insecurity; I, for one, turn all my anxiety inward. Every time someone re-tweets one of my jokes, it sets off a spate of fretting about reciprocity.         \n\nIf the person is a total stranger whose feed I do not follow, then I will look at this feed and consider climbing aboard. I\u2019ll look at the ratio of how many tweets to how many followers that person has: if it exceeds 10 to 1, then I may suddenly feel shy. Because this person is unknown to me, I will feel no compunction to re-tweet a post of hers, though I may be tempted to \u201cfavorite\u201d (the equivalent of Facebook\u2019s \u201clike\u201d button) one.         \n\nBut what if the person who has re-tweeted me is someone I know? Suddenly the pressure mounts. I\u2019ll proceed to follow her, of course, if I don\u2019t already. Then I\u2019ll start feeling very guilty if I don\u2019t re-tweet one of her posts.         \n\nOccasionally the disquiet caused by scanning an acquaintance\u2019s home page for a reciprocal re-tweet can escalate. Mr. Richter said: \u201cSometimes I just cannot pull the trigger. Then I\u2019ll bump into that person in the real world and they\u2019ll compliment me for my tweet. That\u2019s like saying, \u2018I saw your jail video on the Web!\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nFurther complicating these bouts of anxiety about reciprocity is that they tend to happen in clumps. Like other activities rooted in the nonessential (finally reading that back issue of The Economist, say, or trimming difficult-to-reach hairs on your person), Twitter is at its most compelling when you are trapped in an airport hotel in Tulsa. You\u2019ll write 10 tweets that night, two or three of which will catch fire, drawing traffic. This traffic will want managing. You\u2019ll wake up the next morning and discover you\u2019ve got some thank-you letters to write.
