{"headline": "Transforming an Island House, and Ourselves", "body": "\nIt started a few years back during my ill-fated 50th birthday getaway to Vieques Island, just off the eastern coast of Puerto Rico. When the puddle jumper touched down on the island\u2019s minuscule runway and my partner, Michael, and I emerged from the plane into the fragrant heat, several months of winter dreariness melted away.         \n\nBut my euphoria was short-lived. The vacation rental that had looked so nice online turned out to be a dump. The furniture was falling apart, the sheets and towels were threadbare, and the place was swarming with mosquitoes. Worse yet, around dusk I began to feel feverish, and soon we were waiting anxiously in the island\u2019s understaffed emergency room.         \n\nSinus infection, the doctor sleepily diagnosed, just before midnight.         \n\nI felt terrible for most of the week, but by our seventh and last night I was much better, and over cocktails at the island\u2019s fanciest restaurant I surprised myself by saying, \u201cIf I\u2019ve liked Vieques this much feeling lousy, imagine how much I\u2019ll like it next time.\u201d         \n\nMichael sat up straight. \u201cYou\u2019d give it another try?\u201d         \n\nI took a sip, gazed out across the dark waters, and said, \u201cIn a heartbeat.\u201d         \n\nA year later we returned. This time no one got sick, and the house we rented was a stunner, situated on a high, flat field with spectacular views down to the water. By midweek I found myself wondering how much a house like this would cost. The next morning as we strolled through Isabel Segunda, the island\u2019s main town, I paused in front of a real estate office to scan the listings.         \n\n\u201cCould we swing it?\u201d Michael asked.         \n\n\u201cSwing what?\u201d         \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be coy,\u201d he said. \u201cA house. Down here.\u201d         \n\n\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d I blurted out. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford it.\u201d         \n\nAlthough we had never actually discussed it, the truth came bubbling up: we had both been fantasizing about a tropical retirement for years.         \n\nSix months later we went back to Vieques to buy our dream house. It wasn\u2019t easy. Most of the island\u2019s real estate agents acted as if showing us properties would be a waste of their time (understandable since they\u2019re overrun by rum-soaked vacationers who swear they want to buy but never follow through).         \n\nBy the time we had tracked down Armando, an agent willing to show us around, our visit was almost over. A mad dash through five unappealing houses our last day on the island left us feeling deflated. Maybe next time, we told ourselves as Armando drove us back to the hotel.         \n\nAnd then, rounding a corner, the very house we\u2019d been dreaming of came into view. Although the place had seen better days, its outline was impeccable. Built on a steep incline, it meandered slowly up the hillside in three handsome levels, all boasting panoramic views of the ocean a mile away. Surrounding the house, trees swayed in the breeze, including one of the largest mangoes I had ever seen.         \n\n\u201cStop!\u201d I shrieked.         \n\nArmando slammed on the brakes. \u201cIt\u2019s very nice,\u201d he agreed as we sat staring at it. \u201cThe property was actually on the market until the owners decided not to sell after a couple of offers fell through.\u201d         \n\n\u201cCall them,\u201d I said.         \n\n\u201cNow?\u201d         \n\n\u201cNow or never.\u201d         \n\nFifteen minutes later we were standing on the house\u2019s broad balcony gazing toward the turquoise ocean. And despite that we weren\u2019t allowed to view the downstairs (it was rented), we made an offer later that week. The house was listed at $300,000. Our limit was $250,000, and we bid $230,000. The owners came back at $265,000. We countered at $250,000 and settled at $255,000.         \n\nWhat had we done? We prided ourselves on being sensible people. But buying a house in what felt like a foreign country without having seen all the rooms? \u201cDeranged\u201d may be the word I\u2019m looking for.         \n\nThe next three years were a cavalcade of mini-disasters. When we confronted our property manager after he painted the upstairs rooms orange instead of yellow, he resigned. We were informed that if we didn\u2019t immediately erect a retaining wall our house would slide down the hill ($15,000 we hadn\u2019t budgeted for).
