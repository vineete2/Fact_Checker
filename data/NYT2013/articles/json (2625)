{"headline": "Long Odds for Authors Newly Published", "body": "\n\u201cThe Cuckoo\u2019s Calling\u201d became the publishing sensation of the summer when word leaked that its first-time author, Robert Galbraith, was none other than  \n, the mega-best-selling creator of  \n.         \n\nMystery solved? Maybe not. It\u2019s no surprise that \u201cThe Cuckoo\u2019s Calling,\u201d a detective story set in a London populated by supermodels and rock stars, shot to the top of best-seller lists once the identity of the author was revealed. But if the book is as good as critics are now saying it is, why didn\u2019t it sell more copies before, especially since the rise of online publishing has supposedly made it easier than ever for first-time authors?         \n\n\u201cIt makes me sad,\u201d Roxanne Coady, founder of R. J. Julia Booksellers in Madison, Conn., and the online retailer  \n, told me last week from Maine, where she said she was sitting near a stack of unread new books. \u201cBecause not everyone turns out to be a J. K. Rowling. It reminds me how difficult it is for even good books to succeed.\u201d         \n\nIt\u2019s not entirely clear why Ms. Rowling decided she wanted \u201cto fly under the radar,\u201d as she put it on  \n, other than to say that \u201cbeing Robert Galbraith has been all about the work, which is my favorite part of being a writer.\u201d Writing under a pseudonym obviously ruled out any tedious book signings or publicity appearances, but Ms. Rowling doesn\u2019t have to do anything she doesn\u2019t want to.         \n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t about money, since Ms. Rowling is donating all royalties to charity. \u201cIf sales were what mattered to me most, I would have written under my own name, and with the greatest fanfare,\u201d she said. (A spokeswoman in London for Ms. Rowling responded to my questions by directing me to the Galbraith Web site, and said Ms. Rowling would have no further comment.)         \n\nMs. Rowling\u2019s last book, \u201cThe Casual Vacancy,\u201d an adult comedy of manners published under her name and the first since the end of the Potter series, was met with high expectations and withering reviews from prominent critics. Michiko Kakutani wrote in The New York Times, \u201cthe real-life world she has limned in these pages is so willfully banal, so depressingly clich\u00e9d that \u2018The Casual Vacancy\u2019 is not only disappointing \u2014 it\u2019s dull.\u201d The Los Angeles Times faulted \u201cRowling\u2019s inability to engage us, to invest us sufficiently in her characters.\u201d         \n\nStill, with hardcover sales of just over 1.3 million copies, it was the No. 1 hardcover fiction title of 2012, according to Publishers Weekly\u2019s annual ranking, outselling John Grisham, James Patterson and Danielle Steel.         \n\nMs. Rowling may well have felt that the reaction, both critical and commercial, was distorted by her fame, and hence decided on a pseudonym for \u201cThe Cuckoo\u2019s Calling.\u201d It\u2019s not clear exactly who was in on the secret: her agent, of course, and at least someone at Little, Brown & Company, her publisher, including her editor, who also edited \u201cThe Casual Vacancy.\u201d (\u201cThe Cuckoo\u2019s Calling\u201d was published by Mulholland Books, a Little, Brown imprint.) \u201cFew people within the publishing house knew the true identity of Robert at the time,\u201d Nicole Dewey, a Little, Brown spokeswoman, told me, declining to be more specific about who knew.         \n\nBut that already distorted the experiment to some extent. Given how difficult it is for first-time fiction authors, especially in a crowded genre like mystery, to find both an agent and publisher, it\u2019s not clear \u201cThe Cuckoo\u2019s Calling\u201d would have made it off the slush piles. At least one other publisher, Orion Books, which like Little, Brown, is a subsidiary of the Hachette Book Group, rejected the manuscript. An editor there told The Telegraph in London that the book  \n         \n\nIn any event, a publishing contract is hardly a guarantee of critical or commercial success. Much depends on how a new manuscript is treated by the publisher. Morgan Entrekin, the president and publisher of Grove Atlantic, is widely viewed as a master at introducing new literary talent to the marketplace. He published \u201cCold Mountain\u201d by then first-time novelist Charles Frazier, which went on to win the  \n and sell over 11 million copies.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question, if a publisher decides to get behind a book, to invest its publishing capital, to use its traction with the chains, with Amazon, fight for the promotion money to get the book into the front of stores, you can do a lot to bring attention to a worthy first novel,\u201d he said.         \n\nMr. Entrekin cited \u201cMatterhorn,\u201d by first-time novelist Karl Marlantes, which he published in 2010. The author \u201cworked on the book for over 20 years and couldn\u2019t find a publisher,\u201d Mr. Entrekin said. Then, as the book was about to be published in a tiny first edition, Mr. Entrekin got a copy from a buyer at Barnes & Noble, loved it, and bought out the first printing.         \n\nHe re-edited it, cut 300 pages, got advance quotes from prominent authors, introduced the author to booksellers and hosted a media lunch in Manhattan. Amazon.com gave the book a glowing review, chose it as a best book of the month, and got an exclusive review from Mark Bowden, author of \u201cBlack Hawk Down.\u201d \u201c\u00a0\u2018Matterhorn\u2019 is a great novel,\u201d his review began. It sold over 400,000 copies.
