{"headline": "U.S. Army Hones\nAntiterror Strategy\nfor Africa, in Kansas", "body": "\nFORT RILEY, Kan. \u2014 Here on the Kansas plains, thousands of soldiers once bound for Iraq or Afghanistan are now gearing up for missions in Africa as part of a new Pentagon strategy to train and advise indigenous forces to tackle emerging terrorist threats and other security risks so that American forces do not have to.         \n\nThe first-of-its-kind program is drawing on troops from a 3,500-member brigade in the Army\u2019s storied  \n, known as the Big Red One, to conduct more than 100 missions in Africa over the next year. The missions range from a two-man sniper team in Burundi to 350 soldiers conducting airborne and humanitarian exercises in South Africa.         \n\nThe brigade has also sent a 150-member rapid-response force to Djibouti in the Horn of Africa to protect embassies in emergencies, a direct reply to the attack on the United States Mission in Benghazi, Libya, last year, which killed four Americans.         \n\n\u201cOur goal is to help Africans solve African problems, without having a big American presence,\u201d said Lt. Col. Robert E. Lee Magee, a West Point graduate and third-generation Army officer whose battalion has sent troops to Burundi, Niger and South Africa in the past several months, and whose unit will deploy to Djibouti in December.         \n\nThe American commando raids this month against terrorist operatives in Libya and Somalia underscore the spreading extremist threat in Africa, and a renewed urgency to choke off insurgent cells before they can grow, according to counterterrorism specialists. Teams from the brigade here have already helped train forces in Kenya and Tanzania, which are battling fighters from the Shabab militant group in Somalia.         \n\nPresident Obama, at a  \n three days after the commando raids, said Africa was one of the places \u201cthat you\u2019re seeing some of these groups gather.\u201d         \n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re going to have to continue to go after them,\u201d he added.         \n\nFor that reason, it is no surprise that the military\u2019s  \n is the test case for this new Army program of regionally aligned brigades that will eventually extend to all of the Pentagon\u2019s commands worldwide, including in Europe and Latin America next year. These forces will be told in advance that their deployments will focus on parts of the world that do not have Army troops assigned to them now \u2014 creating a system in which officers and enlisted personnel would develop regional expertise.         \n\nGen. Ray Odierno, the Army chief of staff, said in an interview that the goal was to field an Army that could be \u201cengaged regionally in all the combatant commands to help them shape their theaters, set their theaters, in order to sustain and execute our national security strategy.\u201d         \n\nEven as soldiers prepare for tasks as far-ranging as combat casualty care in Chad or radio training in Mauritania, in a recent visit here they were also conducting target practice in their M1A2 battle tanks on a sprawling firing range, to keep their skills sharp for a future land war against an unforeseen foe. Chad and Mauritania are both combating Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, an offshoot of the main terrorist group.         \n\nBut with the United States military out of Iraq and pulling out of Afghanistan, the Army is looking for new missions around the world. \u201cAs we reduce the rotational requirement to combat areas, we can use these forces to great effect in Africa,\u201d Gen. David M. Rodriguez, the head of the Africa Command, told Congress this year.         \n\nMissions that were once performed largely by Special Operations forces, including the Army\u2019s Green Berets, are now falling to regular infantry troops like members of the  \n, nicknamed the Dagger Brigade, here at Fort Riley.         \n\nThis summer, nearly two dozen of the brigade\u2019s soldiers deployed to Niger, in West Africa, to help train troops for United Nations peacekeeping duty in neighboring Mali. The Americans set up tents on a government-owned farm two hours north of the capital, Niamey, shooing away the goats, cows and chickens.         \n\nFor 10 weeks, they weathered sandstorms and temperatures that soared beyond 110 degrees to teach the Nigerien troops marksmanship, patrolling skills and medical care. The troops drilled in the morning, rested from the midday heat and then resumed classes in the evening. Among the worries in Niger is the threat posed by Boko Haram, an Islamic militant group with ties to Al Qaeda.
