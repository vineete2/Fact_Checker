{"headline": "In Argentine Soccer, a Rivalry Cleaves a City", "body": "\nROSARIO, Argentina \u2014 Ask a soccer fan to name the fiercest rivalry in Argentina, and it is a near certainty the reply will be Boca Juniors versus River Plate, the battle for Buenos Aires popularly known as el supercl\u00e1sico. Another capital derby, Independiente versus Racing, ignites the industrial suburb of Avellaneda, where those clubs\u2019 stadiums  \n.         \n\nBut in this port city along the Paran\u00e1 River, the hometown of Lionel Messi and the departure point for most of Argentina\u2019s vast soybean exports, soccer breeds a division that is apparent on almost every street corner. At each turn in the city\u2019s north side, walls, streetlights and sidewalks are painted the blue and yellow of Rosario Central. In the south, they are the black and red of Newell\u2019s Old Boys. Murals, many of which stretch half a block, mark the teams\u2019 territory.         \n\nThere are no neutrals in Rosario.         \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re either a Central fan, a Newell\u2019s fan, or you\u2019re nothing,\u201d said Juan Yacob, who runs a Central-themed restaurant.         \n\nIn the weeks before the teams meet, as they will Sunday after a rare lull in their century-old rivalry, the winds of unease blow strongest.         \n\n\u201cPeople start to move differently on the sidewalk,\u201d said Mario Zanabria, a famous figure at Newell\u2019s who scored a goal against Central in 1974 that secured the club\u2019s first league title.  \n, 65, played in numerous other rivalries, including Boca-River. But Central against Newell\u2019s, he said, is the most stressful.         \n\n\u201cIt moves an entire city,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe sense of belonging on each side is such that in 1970, when Central was considering an offer to sell Aldo Poy, a forward who grew up three blocks from the club\u2019s stadium, he blocked the move by hiding on an island in the Paran\u00e1. A year later, Poy scored the most celebrated goal in Central\u2019s history.         \n\nThe devotion is so complete that residents of the city are often described not as fans, but as sufferers of a disease. Central supporters have been known as canallas, or scoundrels, since at least the 1930s, after the club was said to have refused to play a fund-raiser for Rosario\u2019s leprosy patients. Newell\u2019s, which had agreed to play, was nicknamed leprosos, or lepers.         \n\n\u201cRosario is sick,\u201d said Mart\u00edn Souto, a journalist who has reported on all of Argentina\u2019s major rivalries. \u201cIt\u2019s the city with the most pathological supporters, where the lines blur between hate, derision and violence. It\u2019s incomparable.\u201d         \n\nThe rivalry began in 1905, when soccer in Argentina was still an amateur sport and clubs like Newell\u2019s and Central were organized by British immigrants. Newell\u2019s won the first match, 1-0.         \n\nThere have been 252 further encounters, the last of which was in 2010, weeks before Central was relegated to the second division. For three years, the biannual league meetings have been sorely missed by Rosarinos, as people from the city are known. But Central won promotion in May, so the hiatus will end this weekend.         \n\n\u201cFacing Central after this gap undoubtedly generates a lot of expectation,\u201d Newell\u2019s coach, Alfredo Berti, said.         \n\nBerti said he would try to isolate his players from the tumult, but it is an impossible task. David Trezeguet, a striker who won a World Cup with France in 1998, joined Newell\u2019s on loan in the off-season. He has never taken part in the rivalry but acknowledged, \u201cI\u2019m conscious of the pressure.\u201d         \n\nThe anxiety of the buildup and the elation felt \u2014 or ridicule endured \u2014 afterward are such that it is said that a Central-Newell\u2019s match lasts weeks. As the occasion nears, children dress for classes with jerseys beneath their school uniforms. Roberto Fontanarrosa, an Argentine writer and Central fan, once wrote of \u201cthe thousand bad jokes that sprout like mushrooms after each defeat,\u201d adding, \u201cYou have to go to bed and not get out for 20 days.\u201d         \n\nThat was how Newell\u2019s fans must have felt when Poy scored  \n (the dove) in 1971, a diving header that assured victory over Newell\u2019s in the semifinals of the league championship. The cross had come in fast, \u201cjust three feet off the ground,\u201d recalled Poy, now 68. \u201cThe only way to get to the ball was by throwing myself at it, and I arrived at exactly the right moment.\u201d Three days later, Central won the final to become champions for the first time.         \n\nChe Guevara, a revolutionary, was born in Rosario and was a Central supporter. One club publication delights in the image of Guevara, during a voyage in 1952 when he was still a medical student, curing patients at an Amazonian leper colony. Newell\u2019s followers count Messi, who grew up on a modest street here, among their ranks. Messi was 13 when he agreed to leave Newell\u2019s for Barcelona, establishing himself in Spain as the finest player of his generation. Since July, he has been managed in Spain by Gerardo Martino, nicknamed Tata, who left Newell\u2019s earlier this year after guiding the club to its sixth league title.         \n\n\u201cThank you Tata,\u201d reads some of the graffiti on the city\u2019s south side, but halfway through the current 19-game season, his legacy lives on.  \n, far ahead of even mighty Boca and River Plate, and plays the most fluid soccer in Argentina. Central is 16th in the 20-team league, with only three wins from its first 11 games and still recovering from three consecutive seasons in the second division.         \n\nNewell\u2019s fans will not have the opportunity to gloat at Central\u2019s  \n on Sunday. Away supporters throughout Argentina are currently barred from attending matches because of a fresh spate of the violence, sometimes fatal, that has long plagued soccer in the country. Rosario is no exception.\u00a0         \n\nIn March, a man wearing a Central jersey in Newell\u2019s territory shot at rival fans who confronted him. Two months earlier, two exhibition matches between the clubs were canceled after a series of violent confrontations. Club buildings were set afire, and a police officer was shot in the neck.         \n\nMany here wish for a friendly rivalry. \u201cIt\u2019s not a war,\u201d said Nahuel Guzm\u00e1n, the Newell\u2019s goalkeeper. But supporters harbor strong feelings.         \n\n\u201cFirst come my mom and dad; then Newell\u2019s,\u201d said Tom\u00e1s Tessaro, 22, who said he was from a long line of Newell\u2019s supporters.         \n\nIn Rosario, allegiances like Tessaro\u2019s are not a choice, but an inheritance. Asked once at what point he became a Central fan, C\u00e9sar Menotti, a World Cup-winning coach with Argentina in 1978, replied, \u201cSince I was born.\u201d         \n\nIf it were possible, people here might also opt for a death tied to their team\u2019s colors. Newell\u2019s fans chant that they want to die of leprosy. And in another of his short stories, Fontanarrosa conceives of the most glorious death for a Central supporter. He tells of an old man, known as Casale, who has a fatal heart attack amid the euphoria of Central\u2019s first title victory in 1971.         \n\n\u201cWhat does it matter!\u201d the story\u2019s protagonist exclaims upon seeing Casale fall to the concrete floor of the stadium grandstand. \u201cFor a \u2018canalla,\u2019 that is the way to die!\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/16/sports/soccer/in-argentine-soccer-a-rivalry-cleaves-a-city.html", "date": "2013-10-15", "description": "One of the most-heated soccer rivalries in Argentina will be renewed Sunday in a port city on the Paran\u00e1 River when Rosario Central faces Newell\u2019s Old Boys."}
