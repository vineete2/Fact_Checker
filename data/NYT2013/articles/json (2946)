{"headline": "Big Shot on Campus, and Everywhere, After Buzzer-Beater", "body": "\nNEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. \u2014 In the 24 hours that followed the  \n, Khalil Edney rode in a limousine, stayed overnight at a Manhattan hotel, conducted national television interviews, held a makeshift news conference and resumed the end of his usual routine \u2014 an anticlimactic high school basketball practice.         \n\nLife was different. Way different.         \n\nOn Sunday, Edney was a 17-year-old star quarterback who moonlighted with the New Rochelle High School basketball team. He ranked second in scoring, but as a reserve, and an injured one at that, who nearly missed this particular playoff game with a bum ankle.         \n\nBy Monday, he had become a new-age celebrity, a (young) man of the moment, sought after, in demand, and all because of one play that lasted a couple of seconds: a two-handed heave that traveled 55 or so feet and won New Rochelle a playoff contest. It became known simply and unoriginally as The Shot.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what the world\u2019s calling it,\u201d Khalil said.         \n\nThe world? It certainly seemed that way. Edney went on three morning shows, including \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d on which his story followed one about the pope. He appeared on ESPN\u2019s flagship program, \u201cSportsCenter,\u201d twice. He had an interview scheduled with CNN for Tuesday morning and one YouTube video of The Shot had already accumulated more than 1.4 million views by late afternoon.         \n\nThis said less about the basketball player and his moment than it did about this era of modern sports. In a world driven and captured and analyzed on social media, the feedback is instant, often overdramatized. A high school playoff game can conclude in dramatic fashion in Westchester County, and word can spread across the country in a matter of minutes \u2014 the best shot ever, the best buzzer-beater ever, Facebook post after Facebook post Sunday with the same question:         \n\nDid you see The Shot?         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d said Don Conetta, the principal at New Rochelle. \u201cFor all the things we do in education, this one-tenth-of-a-second shot is getting unbelievable attention from the world.\u201d         \n\nThe play itself almost defied description and belief: New Rochelle was losing, 60-58, to Mount Vernon, its counterpart in a rivalry that Mount Vernon usually dominated. All of 2.9 seconds remained in the Section 1 Class AA final. The outlook looked bleak.         \n\nEdney\u2019s youngest brother turned to their father, Lewis Edney, in the stands and said, \u201cDaddy, we do this all the time in the park.\u201d         \n\nCoach Rasaun Young called for an inbounds play named Valpo, after the  \n in the 1998 N.C.A.A. tournament to secure a first-round victory for Valparaiso. That buzzer-beater started with a long inbounds pass, followed by another, shorter pass to Drew on the right wing.         \n\nYoung called for the same play. It did not unfold how he drew it up.         \n\nEdney took the ball along the baseline and heaved the ball down court, toward his teammate Joe Clarke, the same friend he connected with for a winning touchdown late in the state football semifinals. This pass, though, was intercepted by a Mount Vernon player, who could have held the ball or thrown it straight into the air, but who instead tossed it back toward Edney.         \n\nEdney had followed his initial throw upcourt. He says he is still not sure exactly why he did that, only that he did. He secured the ball thrown by the Mount Vernon player and in one motion pushed up the desperation heave.         \n\nThe play-by-play announcer on MSG Varsity deftly switched gears, from \u201cAnd Mount Vernon is going to hold on and win!\u201d to \u201cBut hold on one second!\u201d to a series of pure screams.         \n\nNew Rochelle Athletic Director Steve Young sat behind the team bench. As he watched The Shot, he liked the trajectory, and he whispered, \u201cThis might go in.\u201d         \n\nIt did, and bedlam ensued, first among Mount Vernon and its fans, who assumed the clock had run out before Edney got the shot off, then among New Rochelle and its supporters once the referees affirmed he had. Teammates piled on top of Edney. Fans streamed onto the court. A referee covered his head as the mob approached.         \n\nOne teammate soon posted on Twitter, along with video of The Shot: \u201cProm date?\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/05/sports/khalil-edney-is-big-shot-at-new-rochelle-high-school-and-on-youtube.html", "date": "2013-03-04", "description": "Khalil Edney became a basketball star of the moment on YouTube and national television after he heaved a winning 55-foot shot at the buzzer for New Rochelle High School."}
