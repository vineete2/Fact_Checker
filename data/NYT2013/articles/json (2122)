{"headline": "\u2018Frozen,\u2019 Disney\u2019s New Fairy Tale, Is No. 2 at Box Office", "body": "\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Billboards that buried the princesses in snow. TV ads that emphasized action and screwball comedy while playing down romance and sisterhood. Trailers that concealed the Broadway-style musical numbers.         \n\nWas it enough to convince boys that  \n is not just for girls?         \n\nAnd then some:  \n Studios said that its latest animated fairy tale took in an estimated $93 million between Wednesday and Sunday \u2014 one of the best Thanksgiving debuts on record, according to box-office analysts. The movie, which received an A-plus score from ticket buyers in exit polls, notably faces no major animated competition through the Christmas holiday.         \n\nAs expected, the No. 1 movie in North America over the five-day weekend was  \n Released by Lionsgate, \u201cCatching Fire\u201d took in an estimated $110.2 million, for a two-week domestic total of $296.5 million, according to Rentrak, which compiles box-office data.         \n\nA blockbuster response to \u201cFrozen,\u201d about two princess sisters and a wisecracking snowman named Olaf, was less of a sure thing. To justify the film\u2019s cost \u2014 roughly $250 million in production and global marketing expenses \u2014 Disney needed \u201cFrozen\u201d to charm everyone. The studio was confident that girls would show up, but it was scared that boys would take one look and respond with a sneer: Eww, a princess movie.         \n\nThat concern became deeply ingrained at Disney after the 2009 release of  \n which was a box-office dud; studio research indicated that boys recoiled in part because of  \n in the title. Disney decided to give its next fairy tale musical, centered on Rapunzel, the gender-neutral title  \n prompting a mini-controversy.         \n\nFor \u201cFrozen,\u201d very loosely based on the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale  \n Disney\u2019s marketing ploys seemed to work. About 43 percent of the opening-weekend audience for the movie was male, according to exit polls. To compare, the first weekend of \u201cTangled\u201d drew a crowd that was 39 percent male.         \n\n\u201cBoys really respond to humor, and we fortunately had an enormous supply of that from Olaf the snowman,\u201d said Dave Hollis, executive vice president for distribution at Walt Disney Studios. Addressing the marketing campaign, Mr. Hollis said that Disney tested materials with focus groups, and \u201cwith any piece that polarized one audience or another, there was a strategic decision to hold it.\u201d         \n\nThe success of \u201cFrozen\u201d means much more to Disney than box-office receipts. The company\u2019s theme parks rely on hit music from its movies, for instance, and Disney has recently shied away from full-blown musicals. As a leading Oscar contender for best animated film, \u201cFrozen\u201d also cements a Pixar-led turnaround at the historic but in recent times lagging Walt Disney Animation Studios.         \n\n\u201cTo see the impact of John\u2019s creative oversight has really been extraordinary,\u201d Mr. Hollis said, referring to John Lasseter, the Pixar co-founder  \n Disney\u2019s animation operation in 2006.         \n\nPrincess-related merchandise generates billions of dollars in revenue for Disney. Items tied to the \u201cFrozen\u201d sisters, Anna and Elsa, voiced by Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel, and Olaf, voiced by Josh Gad, are hot holiday gifts, retailers say. (Anna and Elsa, for the record, have not joined the likes of Snow White and Sleeping Beauty as \u201cofficial\u201d Disney princesses.)         \n\nWith so much on the line, Disney fired up its vaunted cross-marketing engines. \u201cFrozen\u201d had a titanic presence on Disney Channel; costumed characters were deployed to the Norway pavilion at Epcot at Walt Disney World; the movie\u2019s central showstopping song, \u201cLet It Go,\u201d written by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Bobby Lopez ( \n \u201cAvenue Q\u201d), became  \n of the Disneyland Resort\u2019s World of Color fountain extravaganza. There was even a 12-city \u201cFrozen\u201d hash brown giveaway sponsored by Ore-Ida.         \n\nFor the five-day weekend,  \n (Disney) was third at theaters, taking in about $15.5 million, for a four-week total of $186.7 million.  \n (Universal) was fourth, selling an estimated $11.1 million, for a three-week total of $63.4 million. And with a script by Sylvester Stallone,  \n (Open Road) arrived in fifth place, taking in about $9.8 million.
