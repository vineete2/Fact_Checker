{"headline": "Weiner\u2019s Surprising Rebound From Scandal", "body": "\nAngela Curtis, 47, a former prison officer, was angry when she heard that Anthony D. Weiner would be speaking at her daughter\u2019s high school graduation in Queens. As a congressman, he had lied to the public and embarrassed his family, she thought. What more did he have to say?         \n\nBut then Mr. Weiner took the microphone. He invoked the \u201carc of the hero\u201d and, weaving in stories of Nelson Mandela and Franklin D. Roosevelt, acknowledged his own struggle to recover from adversity.         \n\nMs. Curtis was moved by his candor. \u201cHe deserves a chance,\u201d she said after the speech last Saturday.         \n\nWritten off by election experts and shunned by the political establishment, Mr. Weiner has once again upended popular conceptions about him, vaulting to the front of the race for mayor.         \n\nMany political insiders are puzzled by Mr. Weiner\u2019s strength in recent polls, which place him neck-and-neck with the longtime front-runner, Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, in the Democratic primary.         \n\nRival campaigns, which long ago predicted that he would never get beyond the scandal involving lewd photos he sent women over the Internet, say his gains are fleeting.         \n\nBut interviews with more than two dozen New York City voters over the past several days reveal a range of reasons for the attraction to Mr. Weiner.         \n\nOne is a fascination with the celebrity he has become: an encounter with Mr. Weiner on the street is an event that other candidates cannot replicate, given his fame and outsize personality.         \n\nAnother factor is his aggressive manner \u2014 those who have watched him say he seems ready to fight for their needs.         \n\nBut other voters say it is Mr. Weiner\u2019s flaws, and his attempts to make peace with the past, that are making them take notice.         \n\n\u201cHe sounds honest, in spite of what happened,\u201d said Regina McClean, 56, a legal secretary who lives in Jamaica, Queens. \u201cHe has a humble spirit to him. We have to forgive and forget.\u201d         \n\nWith a hotly contested Democratic primary two months away, Mr. Weiner is racing to turn the electricity around his candidacy into votes. It will not be easy: he is running a highly unusual campaign, with a plump war chest of about $5 million but a relatively small army of several hundred volunteers. (His opponents have thousands.)         \n\nMr. Weiner said he was surprised by how warmly New Yorkers had embraced his candidacy, which he announced in May.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m more vulnerable in kind of this weird way,\u201d he said during an interview last weekend at a restaurant in Midtown Manhattan. \u201cThey\u2019ve seen so deep into my personal life, I hate to say it.\u201d         \n\nBut he said he did not give polls too much weight, and he acknowledged that media attention might partly explain his support.         \n\n\u201cA large number of people are prepared to give me a second chance,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to prove myself.\u201d         \n\nThe race for mayor seems still unformed, with seven Democrats vying for the nomination. Nearly two-thirds of Democratic voters surveyed said they were not firmly committed to a candidate, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC New York/Marist Poll in late June.         \n\nMr. Weiner is statistically even with Ms. Quinn, the poll found. He has the highest negative ratings of any candidate. Some of the groups that view him most positively are men, young people and African-American voters, according to the poll.         \n\nSixty-two percent of men, for example, said they had a favorable opinion of him, compared with 45 percent of women.         \n\nMr. Weiner\u2019s critics say his poll numbers will fall if his opponents resurrect the scandal that forced him from office and alienated swaths of voters. His campaign\u2019s lack of political infrastructure might also make it more difficult to get his supporters to the polls, in a year when turnout is expected to be modest.         \n\n\u201cCandidates love it when they walk down a parade and people clap,\u201d said Lee M. Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion at Marist College. \u201cBut that does not mean that voters are going to be showing on Primary Day.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/06/nyregion/weiners-surprising-rebound-from-scandal.html", "date": "2013-07-05", "description": "With the Democratic mayoral primary drawing closer, Anthony D.
