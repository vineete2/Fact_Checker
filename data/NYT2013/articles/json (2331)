{"headline": "Rigorous Schools Put College Dreams Into Practice", "body": "\nALONG his block in Newark\u2019s West Ward, where drugs are endemic and the young residents talk about shootings with alarming nonchalance, Najee Little is known as the smart kid. He got all A\u2019s his sophomore year, breezing through math and awing his English teachers. His mother, a day care worker, and father, who does odd jobs to make ends meet, have high aspirations for him. They want him to earn a college degree.         \n\nSo last year, when Bard College opened an early college  \n for disadvantaged students with dreams of a bachelor\u2019s degree, he was sure he\u2019d do well there. He wrote his first long paper on Plato\u2019s \u201cRepublic,\u201d expecting a top grade. He got a D minus. \u201cHonestly,\u201d he recalled, \u201cI was kind of discouraged.\u201d         \n\nThat paper marked the beginning of a trying academic path that would both excite and disillusion him. The past two years have been peppered with some promising grades \u2014 an A in environmental science \u2014 and some doozies. He failed \u201cAfrica in World History\u201d and squeaked by in calculus. Mostly, he came to realize that getting into college and staying there would be a herculean task. There was tricky grammar, hard math and tons of homework. There was the neighborhood cacophony to tune out and the call of his Xbox. And there was the fact that no one in his house could help him.         \n\n\u201cMy work is more advanced than anyone at home has experienced,\u201d he said. And that, it turns out, is why the school had accepted him.         \n\nAcross the country in communities like Newark, the early college high school model is being lauded as a way to provide low-income students with a road map to and through college. According to the most recent figures from the \n 68 percent of all high school graduates make it to a two- or four-year institution, but only 52 percent of low-income students do the same. Of poor students in four-year institutions, only 47 percent graduate within six years, compared with 58 percent of the general population.         \n\nNot surprisingly, the challenges are greatest for students whose parents did not attend any college: their graduation rate hovers around 40 percent. Early college high schools seek to rectify that, by merging high school and some college. Students can earn both a high school diploma and an associate degree, and some are set on the path to a four-year degree.         \n\nEducators and big-ticket donors have praised the schools for saving students money and time \u2014 most schools compress the academic experience into four years. Since 2002, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has provided more than $40 million toward initiatives. The Ford Foundation and the Carnegie Corporation of New York have also chipped in. President Obama is a proponent, giving a shout-out in his State of the Union address to  \n, a public-private partnership that pairs the New York City public school system and the City University of New York with I.B.M., which promises graduates a shot at a well-paying job.         \n\nThere are now more than 400 early college high schools across the country \u2014 North Carolina has 76 of them \u2014 educating an estimated 100,000 students.         \n\nBard, a liberal arts college in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., is at the vanguard of the movement, with a president, Leon Botstein, who has long chastised the American high school system for its inefficiencies. More than 30 years ago, Bard took over  \n, a private college for 11th graders and up in Great Barrington, Mass. In 2001, it opened an early college  \n enormously popular with hyper-motivated New Yorkers, and in 2008 it started  \n that has become a magnet for the high-achieving offspring of Chinese, Polish and Bengali immigrants. Until now, Bard\u2019s model has largely focused on elite students.         \n\nIn Newark, Bard moved into a school building across from a tire shop and a bail bond business. Hanging outside is a cheerful red banner with the Bard name etched in white, as if to signal that new life is being breathed into the neighborhood.         \n\nAdministrators admitted 87 eighth graders as freshmen in fall 2011, and 36 sophomores as juniors who could expect to start college-level work immediately. This year, there are students in all four grades.         \n\nNajee seemed like a perfect fit. He had been pulling in top marks as a high school sophomore, but was bored by a math class that rarely progressed past the basics and never required homework. Essays for other classes were usually half a page long. Only once did a teacher assign a full-length book to read \u2014 \u201cFahrenheit 451.\u201d And that was over the summer. Najee was also eager to create some distance between himself and his rough-and-tumble neighborhood, where a good friend had been stabbed to death \u201cover an incident with a girl.\u201d         \n\nHis new classmates at Bard were similarly seeking to cocoon themselves somewhere safe and supportive. Miles Scott lives with his grandmother after his mother and father died within two years of each other. Billy Caraballo has been in and out of half a dozen schools. He calls Bard \u201ca second chance.\u201d Marvin Pinkrah transferred from a low-performing high school but had strong early preparation in Ghana. Friends call him \u201cthe human dictionary\u201d and turn to him for help.
