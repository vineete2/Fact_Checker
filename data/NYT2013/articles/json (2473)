{"headline": "Master\u2019s Degree Is New Frontier of Study Online", "body": "\nNext January, the Georgia Institute of Technology plans to offer a master\u2019s degree in computer science through massive open online courses for a fraction of the on-campus cost, a first for an elite institution. If it even approaches its goal of drawing thousands of students, it could signal a change to the landscape of higher education.         \n\nFrom their start two years ago, when a free artificial intelligence course from Stanford enrolled 170,000 students, free massive open online courses, or MOOCs, have drawn millions and yielded results like the perfect scores of Battushig, a 15-year-old Mongolian boy, in a tough electronics course offered by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.         \n\nBut the courses have not yet produced profound change, partly because they offer no credit and do not lead to a degree. The disruption may be approaching, though, as Georgia Tech, which has one of the country\u2019s top computer science programs, plans to offer a MOOC-based online master\u2019s degree in computer science for $6,600 \u2014 far less than the $45,000 on-campus price.         \n\nZvi Galil, the dean of the university\u2019s College of Computing, expects that in the coming years, the program could attract up to 10,000 students annually, many from outside the United States and some who would not complete the full master\u2019s degree. \u201cOnline, there\u2019s no visa problem,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe program rests on an unusual partnership forged by Dr. Galil and Sebastian Thrun, a founder of Udacity, a Silicon Valley provider of the open online courses.         \n\nAlthough it is just one degree at one university, the prospect of a prestigious low-cost degree program has generated great interest. Some educators think the leap from individual noncredit courses to full degree programs could signal the next phase in the evolution of MOOCs \u2014 and bring real change to higher education.         \n\n\u201cPerhaps Zvi Galil and Sebastian Thrun will prove to be the Wright brothers of MOOCs,\u201d said S. James Gates Jr., a University of Maryland physicist who serves on President Obama\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. \u201cThis is the first deliberate and thoughtful attempt to apply education technology to bringing instruction to scale. It could be epoch-making. If it really works, it could begin the process of lowering the cost of education, and lowering barriers for millions of Americans.\u201d         \n\nThe plan is for Georgia Tech to provide the content and professors and to get 60 percent of the revenue, and for Udacity to offer the computer platform, provide course assistants and receive the other 40 percent. The projected budget for the test run starting in January is $3.1 million \u2014 including $2 million donated by AT&T, which will use the program to train employees and find potential hires \u2014 with $240,000 in profits. By the third year, the projection is for $14.3 million in costs and $4.7 million in profits.         \n\nThe courses will be online and free for those not seeking a degree; those in the degree program will take proctored exams and have access to tutoring, online office hours and other support services. Students who cannot meet the program\u2019s stringent admission standards may be admitted provisionally and allowed to transfer in if they do well in their first two courses. And students who complete only a few courses would get a certificate.         \n\n\u201cThis is all uncharted territory, so no one really knows if it will go to scale,\u201d Dr. Galil said. \u201cWe just want to prove that it can be done, to make a high-quality degree program available for a low cost.\u201d         \n\nWould such a program cannibalize campus enrollment? \u201cFrankly,\u201d he said, \u201cnobody knows.\u201d         \n\nNot everyone believes that such a degree program will be sustainable, or that it would even be a step forward.         \n\n\u201cThe whole MOOC mania has got everyone buzzing in academia, but scaling is a great challenge,\u201d said Bruce Chaloux, the executive director of the Sloan Consortium, an advocacy group for online education. \u201cI have to believe that at some point, when the underwriting ends, to keep high quality, Georgia Tech would have to float to more traditional tuition rates.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/education/masters-degree-is-new-frontier-of-study-online.html", "date": "2013-08-17", "description": "The master\u2019s degree offered by the Georgia Institute of Technology through massive open online courses has the potential to disrupt higher education."}
