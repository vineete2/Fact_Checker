{"headline": "Where Bettors Go to Lose, Some Doubts", "body": "\nI took a stroll through a glowing forest of slot machines \u2014 past a hospital aide who fed ragged dollars into them and a retired transit worker who peered into his empty wallet and a security guard who eyed me, wondering when I was going to sit down and start losing money.         \n\nIt was early Monday morning, and I was inside the Resort World Casino at Aqueduct Racetrack, which looks like an airport departure lounge mated with a pinball machine. There were no smiles and no talk, and eye contact was reserved for the slot machine. Then I stepped outside and squinted into a sharp morning sun at Stu Litwin, an electrician. He was ambling toward the casino from the A train.         \n\nWhat do you think, I asked him, of Gov.  \n\u2019s plan to open up New York State to seven casinos like this? He shook his head, rueful.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a losing deal, casinos,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest, I should have my head examined for coming here. You really don\u2019t want the whole city doing this.\u201d         \n\nOur governor has developed a pronounced taste for gambling\u2019s revenue streams. He has put a constitutional referendum on the ballot to allow full-fledged casinos, proposing to raise money for schools by letting the industry run its fingers through the pockets of working New Yorkers.         \n\nThe gambling industry now finds itself at El Dorado\u2019s doorstep. And the governor tells us not to worry. He is righteous, and the industry will be carefully regulated.         \n\nIt\u2019s intriguing to examine the effort to reform a related gambling enterprise: the  \n, now controlled by the state. This industry, which oversees racetracks, fell into a despond of corruption a decade back, with the drugging of horses and rigging of bets. Federal prosecutors circled.         \n\nReform began a couple of years ago in patented Cuomo fashion, which is to say with anonymous quotes about heads rolling. Top officials were fired, and reform was rolled out. Mr. Cuomo installed David Skorton, Cornell\u2019s well-regarded president, as board chairman.         \n\nHoldovers from the troubled, pre-reform days, however, still make up a working majority of the board. Its lack of diversity is perversely impressive: 16 of its 17 members are white men. The other one is a white woman.         \n\nMr. Cuomo selected eight appointees notable less for their knowledge of horse racing than their track record in writing checks to his campaigns.         \n\nHe also named two Cuomo family retainers: the financiers Michael J. Del Giudice and Vincent Tese.         \n\nMr. Tese, who with his wife donated $186,000 to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s various campaigns, is an  \n guru. He is a welcome sight for chief executives. While on the Bear Stearns board, he allowed executives to fashion their compensation packages.         \n\nAt Cablevision, shareholders twice mounted campaigns to evict him from the board. James L. Dolan, the chief executive, twice blocked these efforts. Mr. Dolan and his father, who is chairman of the board, each made more than $16 million last year.         \n\nInevitably, Mr. Tese suggested that the racing association\u2019s chief executive needed more money. He recommended $300,000 with a $250,000 incentive pay package, much more than the current chief executive made at his last job.         \n\nTransparency, too, has flagged. Two years ago, Getnick & Getnick, which had been appointed by a federal court to monitor the racing association, filed a deeply critical report. The association, it noted, was sliding backward. Regulations had been loosened at special security barns, intended to stop the drugging of horses. And the association again was doing business with companies that specialize in computerized odds-making favorable to professional gamblers. The old board promptly fired Getnick & Getnick. The report remains sealed.         \n\nWith this reform experience as prologue, let\u2019s turn to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s efforts to persuade New Yorkers to approve expanded legalized gambling. His aides took care to word the measure in what might be called the  \n Triumphal Style: \u00a0\u201cThe proposed amendment,\u201d the ballot reads, promotes \u201cjob growth, increasing aid to schools, and permitting local governments to lower property taxes through revenues generated.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThe only thing they left out was \u2018world peace,\u2019\u00a0\u201d notes David Blankenhorn, president of the Institute for American Values. Which brings me back to Mr. Litwin, that stocky electrician. He talks of his gambling as an alcoholic would of the bottle. \u201cI\u2019ve lost thousands of dollars, and my wife is ready to shoot me.\u201d He shrugged and tugged on his black baseball cap. \u201cShe should really. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/24/nyregion/where-bettors-go-to-lose-some-doubts.html", "date": "2013-09-23", "description": "The way the New York Racing Association is overseen raises questions about Gov.
