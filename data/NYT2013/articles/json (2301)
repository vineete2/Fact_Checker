{"headline": "Justices Cast Doubt on Benefits Ban in U.S. Marriage Law", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court  \n to strike down a central part of a federal law that defines marriage as the union of a man and a woman, as a majority of the justices expressed reservations about the Defense of Marriage Act.         \n\nOn the second day of intense arguments over the volatile issue of  \n, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who most likely holds the decisive vote, returned again and again to the theme that deciding who is married is a matter for the states. The federal government, he said, should respect \u201cthe historic commitment of marriage, and of questions of the rights of children, to the states.\u201d         \n\nThat suggests that he is prepared to vote with the court\u2019s four liberal members to strike down the part of the 1996 law that recognizes only the marriages of opposite-sex couples for more than 1,000 federal laws and programs. Such a ruling would deliver federal benefits to married same-sex couples in the nine states, and the District of Columbia, that allow such unions.         \n\nIf the 1996 law stands, Justice Kennedy said, \u201cyou are at real risk with running in conflict with what has always been thought to be the essence\u201d of state power, which he said was to regulate marriage, divorce and custody.         \n\nAll four members of the court\u2019s liberal wing questioned the constitutionality of the law, though they largely focused on equal protection principles rather than on the limits of federal power.         \n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, for instance, said the law effectively created \u201ctwo kinds of marriage: the full marriage, and then this sort of skim milk marriage.\u201d         \n\nPaul D. Clement, who served as solicitor general under President George W. Bush and is defending the law on behalf of House Republicans, argued that the federal government was entitled to use a uniform definition of marriage across the nation.         \n\nMr. Clement said countless laws over time had been enacted with the traditional definition of marriage in mind. When Congress approved the 1996 law, he said, it was worried that if one state extended the definition to include same-sex couples, those laws would effectively be changed.         \n\n\u201cWhat Congress says is, \u2018Wait a minute,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Clement said of what had happened in 1996. \u201c\u00a0\u2018Let\u2019s take a timeout here. This is a redefinition of an age-old institution.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nJustice Elena Kagan said there was something else at work.         \n\n\u201cDo we really think that Congress was doing this for uniformity reasons, or do we think that Congress\u2019s judgment was infected by dislike, by fear, by animus and so forth?\u201d she asked.         \n\nShe read a passage from the House record at the time that said the law had been animated by a \u201ccollective moral judgment\u201d to \u201cexpress moral disapproval of homosexuality.\u201d         \n\nMr. Clement responded: \u201cOf course, the House report says that. And if that\u2019s enough to invalidate the statute, then you should invalidate the statute. But that has never been your approach.\u201d         \n\n\u201cJust because a couple legislators may have had an improper motive\u201d is irrelevant, Mr. Clement said, adding that the usual question for the court was simply whether the challenged law was supported by a rational justification.         \n\nSolicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. said the 1996 law is deeply unfair and means, for instance, \u201cthat the spouse of a soldier killed in the line of duty cannot receive the dignity and solace of an official notification of next of kin.\u201d         \n\nThe arguments came a day after the court heard a challenge to California\u2019s  \n, which bans same-sex marriages. That argument was murky and muddled, and many of the justices\u2019 questions suggested they were looking for a way to duck the central issue.         \n\nBy comparison, Wednesday\u2019s case was modest, and the arguments were clear. The court heard a preliminary 50-minute session on whether it had jurisdiction to hear the case, but those issues did not seem to threaten to send the case off the rails.         \n\nThe court appointed Vicki C. Jackson, a law professor at Harvard, to argue a position not fully supported by any party: that the case\u2019s odd procedural posture meant the court lacks jurisdiction.
