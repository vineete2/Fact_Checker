{"headline": "In Places Like North St. Louis, Gunfire Still Rules the Night", "body": "\nST. LOUIS \u2014 The unmistakable pop of a gunshot ricocheted through the park in the humid air, and Montez Wayne could only hope that the bullet did not have his name on it. He sprang from his seat beneath a sprawling bald cypress, ready to make his move.         \n\nWas today the day?         \n\nHe had seen it play out too many times before: the blast of gunfire, the blood, the body. In Mr. Wayne\u2019s neighborhood and others on the North Side of St. Louis, drugs, poverty and struggle go hand in hand with gun violence. He barely knows his father. His mother died when he was 14, around the time he started selling drugs. His list of dead friends grows each year.         \n\nMr. Wayne lives in a poor, mostly black community, where, as in similar neighborhoods across America, residents are fed up with persistent gun violence. Victims die one by one, or in clusters. In Chicago, 23 people were shot in a matter of hours in September, 13 of them in a park in a gang-related attack. Three died.         \n\nLast month in North St. Louis, a 16-year-old was fatally shot in a park as he was waiting for a school bus \u2014 a month after his friend was shot to death. And last week, a 17-year-old boy was shot in the face walking to his school bus stop on the city\u2019s North Side. He survived.         \n\nEven as St. Louis and many other cities celebrate significant decreases in crime over the past two decades, concentrated pockets of violence remain, and sometimes grow, a cruel imbalance that criminologists and police departments nationwide are struggling to correct.         \n\nIn the 27th Ward in North St. Louis, for example, there were 17 murders  \n, up from five in  \n. This, even as homicides citywide have dropped nearly 60 percent (113 last year) since peaking at 267 two decades ago.         \n\nMr. Wayne, 23, is hardly an innocent, with repeated arrests for drug possession or trafficking. He will not discuss whether he has ever killed anyone, but says there was a time when he used to arm himself with a gun and break into the homes of drug dealers to steal. He was a hard-core dealer and user, he said, before trying to straighten out. He still hangs out with a crew that calls itself the 20th Street Gang, part of a larger group called the Water Tower Mafia that pledges allegiance to the Crips.         \n\nHis daily routine gives a glimpse of how life here can be marked by shockingly violent interludes on seemingly ordinary days. They come out of nowhere to disrupt a trip to school or the supermarket. \u201cI done seen so many people die like, man, there have been times I just thought I was next,\u201d he said.         \n\n \n         \n\nWhen people in crime-ridden communities hear public officials declare that their cities are safer, they snicker.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a sense of hopelessness on behalf of a lot of people,\u201d said Prince Carter, whose brother,  \n, another neighborhood on the city\u2019s North Side.         \n\nThe killing has rattled Mr. Carter, 49, who sells concessions at a market. He can barely stand to drive past the liquor store where he had to identify his brother\u2019s bloodied body on a snowy afternoon. He now sleeps with a shotgun, avoids going out at night, constantly surveys his surroundings and is planning to leave St. Louis, where he has spent his entire life.         \n\nMr. Wayne, too, is on constant alert. On that hot afternoon this summer when the gunshot rang out in the park, interrupting a conversation with this reporter, Mr. Wayne\u2019s lips curled. He jumped up, twisted his shirtless torso and crouched like a sprinter awaiting a relay baton. But the tension quickly ebbed when he saw a smiling friend clutching a smoking pistol \u2014 he was just test firing the weapon into the grass.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s scary, man,\u201d Mr. Wayne said later. \u201cWhoever tells you they ain\u2019t scared of this life, they lying to you.\u201d         \n\nWhat Mr. Wayne sees on these streets does not correspond with dropping crime statistics. \u201cIt ain\u2019t getting better,\u201d he said. \u201cBeef ain\u2019t going to ever stop because if you shoot him, his people going to come back and shoot one of your people. That\u2019s a never-ending cycle.\u201d         \n\nHe almost saw his time come in August of last year.         \n\nAfter a night of clubbing, Mr. Wayne hopped into a gray Monte Carlo with two friends and his cousin, Darryl Haywood, who was driving. They pulled off the highway, slowing as they came to a yield sign and a cross street when a black Pontiac Grand Am pulled up on their left. They heard a series of loud pops, and glass started flying. \u201cI\u2019m hit,\u201d Mr. Wayne thought, as he curled up in the back seat behind the driver. He implored his cousin, \u201cGo! Go! Go!\u201d         \n\nMr. Haywood peeled right, up a hill, hung a wide left after two blocks and lost control of the car. It crashed into a brick church, coming to rest beneath an arched stained-glass window.
