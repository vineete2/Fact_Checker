Since then, six other poisoned fishers have been found. Two endangered spotted owls tested positive. Mourad W. Gabriel, a scientist at the University of California, Davis,  \n that the contamination began when marijuana growers in deep forests spread d-Con to protect their plants from wood rats.         \n\nThat news has helped growers acknowledge, reluctantly, what their antagonists in law enforcement have long maintained: like industrial logging before it, the booming business of marijuana is a threat to forests whose looming dark redwoods preside over vibrant ecosystems.         \n\nHilltops have been leveled to make room for the crop. Bulldozers start landslides on erosion-prone mountainsides. Road and dam construction clogs some streams with dislodged soil. Others are bled dry by diversions. Little water is left for salmon whose populations have been decimated by logging.         \n\nAnd local and state jurisdictions\u2019 ability to deal with the problem has been hobbled by, among other things, the drug\u2019s  \n. It is approved by the state for medical uses but still illegal under federal law, leading to a patchwork of growers. Some operate within state rules, while others operate totally outside the law.         \n\nThe environmental damage may not be as extensive as that caused by the 19th-century diking of the Humboldt estuary here, or 20th-century clear-cut logging, but the romantic outlaw drug has become a destructive juggernaut, experts agree.         \n\n\u201cIn my career I\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d said Stormer Feiler, a scientist with California\u2019s North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board. \u201cSince 2007 the amount of unregulated activities has exploded.\u201d He added, \u201cThey are grading the mountaintops now, so it affects the whole watershed below.\u201d         \n\nScott Bauer, of the state Department of Fish and Wildlife, said, \u201cI went out on a site yesterday where there was an active water diversion providing water to 15 different groups of people or individuals,\u201d many of them growers. \u201cThe stream is going to dry up this year.\u201d         \n\nWhile it is hard to find data on such an industry, Anthony Silvaggio, a sociology lecturer at Humboldt State University, pointed to anecdotal evidence in a Google Earth virtual \u201cflyover\u201d he made of the industrial farm plots and the damage they cause. The  \n was later enhanced and distributed by Mother Jones magazine.         \n\nBrad Job\u2019s territory as a federal Bureau of Land Management officer includes public lands favored, he said, by Mexican drug cartels whose environmental practices are the most destructive. \u201cThe watershed was already lying on the ground bleeding,\u201d Mr. Job said. \u201cThe people who divert water in the summer are kicking it in the stomach.\u201d         \n\nThat water is crucial to restoring local runs of imperiled Coho salmon, Chinook salmon and steelhead, which swam up Eel River tributaries by the tens of thousands before the logging era. Scott Greacen, executive director of Friends of the Eel River, said, \u201cIt\u2019s not weed that drove the Coho to the brink of extinction, but it may kick it over the edge.\u201d By various estimates, each plant needs at least one gallon and as much as six gallons of water during a season.         \n\nThe idea that the counterculture\u2019s crop of choice is bad for the environment has gone down hard here. Marijuana is an economic staple, particularly in Humboldt County\u2019s rural southern end, called SoHum. Jennifer Budwig, the vice president of a local bank, estimated last year that marijuana infused more than $415 million into the county\u2019s annual economic activity, one-quarter of the total.         \n\nFor the professed hippies who moved here decades ago, marijuana farming combines defiance of society\u2019s strictures, shared communal values and a steady income. \u201cMarijuana has had a framework that started in the 1930s with jazz musicians,\u201d said Gregg Gold, a psychology professor at Humboldt State University. \u201cIt\u2019s a cultural icon of resistance to authority.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIn 2013,\u201d he added, \u201cyou\u2019re asking that we reframe it in people\u2019s minds as just another agribusiness. That\u2019s a huge shift.\u201d         \n\nIt is a thriving agribusiness. Derek Roy, a special agent enforcing endangered species protections for the National Marine Fisheries Service, said, \u201cThese grow sites continue to get larger and larger.\u201d Things took off after 1996, when California decriminalized the use of medical marijuana, Mr. Roy said.
