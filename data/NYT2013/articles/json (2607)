{"headline": "German and British Teams Grouped Together in Champions League", "body": "\nThe four German teams in the UEFA Champions League all were matched against English Premier League opponents on Thursday in the draw for the competition\u2019s group stage in Monaco.         \n\nBayern Munich, the defending champion, was placed in a group with Manchester City. Manchester United will play Bayer Leverkusen, and Chelsea will meet Schalke, Switzerland\u2019s F.C. Basel and Steaua Bucharest in one of the weakest groups. Arsenal got one of the toughest draws, matched against last year\u2019s beaten finalist, Borussia Dortmund; the powerful Italian contender Napoli; and Olympique Marseille of France in the so-called Group of Death.         \n\nBarcelona is in what amounts to a Group of Champions with A.C. Milan, Ajax Amsterdam and Glasgow Celtic; those four clubs have combined for 16 European championships. Barcelona\u2019s Spanish rival, Real Madrid, will play Juventus, Turkey\u2019s Galatasaray and F.C. Copenhagen of Denmark.         \n\nThe groups:         \n\n \nManchester United; Shakhtar Donetsk (Ukraine); Bayer Leverkusen; Real Sociedad         \n\n \nReal Madrid; Juventus; Galatasaray; F.C. Copenhagen         \n\n \nBenfica; Paris St. Germain; Olympiakos; Anderlecht         \n\n \nBayern Munich; CSKA Moscow; Manchester City; Viktoria Plzen (Czech Republic)         \n\n \nChelsea; Schalke; F.C. Basel; Steaua Bucharest         \n\n \nArsenal, Dortmund; Marseille; Napoli         \n\n \nPorto, Zenit St. Petersburg; Atl\u00e9tico Madrid; F.C. Austria Vienna         \n\n \nBarcelona; A.C. Milan; Ajax; Glasgow Celtic         \n\nThe group stage begins Sept. 17 and ends Dec. 11.         \n\nThe 32 teams in the group stage were placed on four pots for the draw after being assigned coefficients based on their success in European competition the past five years and the relative success of their national leagues in the tournament. Because of that, the Champions League has become more of an exclusive club in recent years; 14 of the 32 teams have won the title, and more than a third of the field hails from three leagues: Germany\u2019s Bundesliga, England\u2019s Premier League and Spain\u2019s each have four entries.         \n\nDespite that concentration at the top, it remains as tough to win as ever. No English teams reached the quarterfinals last year, and no club has repeated as European champion since A.C. Milan in 1990.
