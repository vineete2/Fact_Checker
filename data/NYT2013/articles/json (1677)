{"headline": "In Burgundy, Winemakers Who Don\u2019t Own Land", "body": "\nBEAUNE, FRANCE \u2014 Many vintages ago, the n\u00e9gociants, or wine brokers, were considered the big, bad guys of Burgundy. In their barrel rooms in this small city, they controlled the fortunes of hundreds of small growers, unilaterally setting the prices they would pay for wines or grapes. In some bad years or when the economy was depressed, they might decide to buy nothing at all.         \n\nThat set off a gradual revolution in Burgundy in the first half of the 20th century, as more and more estates began to bottle and sell their own wines, cutting the n\u00e9gociants out of the loop. For Burgundy lovers, the declining power of the n\u00e9gociants was a boon. Wonderfully distinctive wines, displaying the intricacies of Burgundian terroir, were showcased by individual estates rather than blended into large quantities of decent but homogeneous wine.         \n\nAs Burgundy has come to be prized the world over, many consumers have come to believe that individual Burgundy estates were small and good while n\u00e9gociants were big and bad, or at best second-rate.         \n\nNo longer. The world of Burgundy has evolved remarkably in the last 30 years. The best of the big n\u00e9gociants, like Joseph Drouhin, Louis Jadot, Bouchard P\u00e8re et Fils and Joseph Faiveley, are meticulous producers of top-quality wines and, in some cases, major landholders themselves. Just as significant has been the rise of the micro-n\u00e9gociant, wine merchants who generally make minute quantities of often superb wines with purchased grapes.         \n\nThese micro-n\u00e9gociants have as many reasons for getting into the business as a glass of Musigny has nuances. Some come from long-established Burgundy estates. Dominique Lafon of Domain des Comtes Lafon wanted his own creative outlet.         \n\nOthers, like Alix de Montille of  \n, the Seysses family of Domaine Dujac and Jean-Marie Fourrier of Domaine Fourrier, wanted to extend their range of wines beyond what could be produced from their family estates. The astronomical prices for the rare pieces of good vineyard that come up for sale (upward of $2 million an acre) made starting a n\u00e9gociant an attractive option.         \n\n\u201cYou can expand a small domain and still wake up and feel free,\u201d Mr. Fourrier said. \u201cOtherwise, you wake up seeing the face of your banker instead of your wife.\u201d         \n\nStarting as a n\u00e9gociant gives talented young winemakers without family holdings, like Philippe Pacalet or Benjamin Leroux, the manager of Domaine du Comte Armand in Pommard, a way to make their own wines.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have vines, and I don\u2019t have capital, but I\u2019m able to show what I can do,\u201d said Mr. Leroux, whose first vintage at his side project, Maison Benjamin Leroux, was in 2007. \u201cThe idea of my own estate has been in my mind for 15 years. I hope to purchase vineyards eventually. It\u2019s a lifetime project.\u201d         \n\nFor now, he makes 32 different beautifully delineated wines as a n\u00e9gociant, often with a single barrel or less of a particular cuv\u00e9e.         \n\nPerhaps most striking are the Burgundy outsiders, those with no ties to the area, who have set up shop as n\u00e9gociants.  \n, an American in the real estate business, was one of the early arrivals in the mid-1990s. He\u2019s been joined by many others, like  \n from the Bay Area, who recently turned his adventures in setting up his micro-n\u00e9gociant, Maison Ilan, into a  \n, \u201cThe Road to Burgundy: The Unlikely Story of an American Making Wine and a New Life in France.\u201d         \n\nOlivier Bernstein was in international music management when the wine bug struck. He now sells small lots of high-end wines at  \n. Koji Nakada was a law student in Tokyo who supported himself as a sommelier in a French restaurant. Now he and his wife, Jae Hwa Park, are the proprietors of  \n, a small n\u00e9gociant that makes a range of fresh, fragrant wines in Gevrey-Chambertin.         \n\nThe n\u00e9gociant house  \n is run by Mounir and Rotem Saouma (he is Lebanese and she is Israeli), who bottle only grand crus and premier crus. Le Moine\u2019s methods hark back to when n\u00e9gociants were known more formally as n\u00e9gociant-\u00e9leveurs. Le Moine does not buy grapes, as most n\u00e9gociants try to do today. Rather, it selects juice or very young wine that has been fermented by the growers and then \u201crears\u201d (from the French verb \u00e9lever) the wine itself in its own barrels and cellar.         \n\nBy contrast, Blair Pethel, a former American financial reporter who moved to Burgundy with his family in 2003, will buy grapes only from growers who permit him to oversee the farming himself. He had more financial backing than some other n\u00e9gociants, and so has also been able to buy land, including a parcel vineyard of grand cru Corton-Charlemagne. His estate, Domaine Dubl\u00e8re, is made from about half purchased grapes and half his own.         \n\n\u201cI make no distinction between the n\u00e9gociant and domaine wines because I treat them exactly the same,\u201d he said.
