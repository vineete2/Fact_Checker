{"headline": "Afghan Leader Says U.S. Abets Taliban\u2019s Goal", "body": "\nKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 President  \n leveled particularly harsh accusations against the United States on Sunday, suggesting that the Americans and the  \n had a common goal in destabilizing his country. The comments cast a shadow on the first visit by  \n as defense secretary.         \n\nThe Afghan president\u2019s discontent with his American allies has been a recurring theme over the past 10 years. Still, his condemnation now, at a critical moment for talks under way on the shape and scope of any American military presence here past 2014, has raised new questions about the two countries\u2019 abilities to bridge their intensifying differences.         \n\nIn recent days, Mr. Karzai has been the most critical about some of the policies that American officials have described as most important to their mission here, including the widespread use of Special Operations forces and a continuing say in how battlefield detainees are vetted and released. He has seized on both as violations of Afghan sovereignty,  \n from Wardak Province and bristling at critical terms in a negotiated agreement on  \n Prison.         \n\nA result was  \n by American officials on Saturday to hand the Afghan government full control of the prison.         \n\nAfter the cancellation of a joint news conference on Sunday \u2014 American officials said security concerns were the cause, even as Afghan officials dismissed that claim \u2014 Mr. Hagel and Mr. Karzai met for private discussions and dinner. Later, Mr. Hagel said the two had had \u201ca very direct conversation.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI know these are difficult issues for President Karzai and the Afghan people,\u201d said Mr. Hagel, a former Republican senator from Nebraska. \u201cAnd I was once a politician, so I can understand the kind of pressures especially leaders of countries are always under.\u201d         \n\nThe defense secretary expressed hope that the United States and Afghanistan \u201ccould move forward, and I have confidence we will, and deal with these issues.\u201d         \n\nAmong Mr. Karzai\u2019s critical comments on Sunday, which came at an early-morning news conference in honor of women\u2019s day in Afghanistan, he charged that the American government and the Taliban, while using different means, had in effect colluded to keep Afghanistan unstable to justify a continued American military presence.         \n\nAmid the negotiations over a post-2014 American presence in Afghanistan, Mr. Karzai has been notably critical about what he sees as doomsaying reports by Western officials and advocacy groups about Afghanistan\u2019s future. He described such reports as propaganda, promulgated through the Western news media and picked up by local Afghan news media, with the goal of undermining Afghan confidence and, by extension, faith in his government.         \n\n\u201cThere is a lot of negative propaganda about what will happen after 2014,\u201d Mr. Karzai said, adding that it has come to be thought of as \u201cthe 2014 movie,\u201d he said, suggesting it was being forecast as a horror show.         \n\nFurther, he accused the Americans of sending contradictory messages about their views of the Taliban: on the one hand claiming to see them as the enemy but at the same time reaching out to them to engage in negotiations, a process that Mr. Karzai\u2019s spokesman, Aimal Faizi, said was still going on. The Americans insist, however, that they are no longer in negotiations with the Taliban and that have ceded their role to Mr. Karzai\u2019s government if talks are ever started. Regardless, many Afghans express confusion about the Americans\u2019 true intentions.         \n\n\u201cOn the one hand, the Taliban are talking with the Americans, but on the other hand, they carry out a bombing in Kabul,\u201d Mr. Karzai said, referring to a bomb that  \n.         \n\n\u201cYesterday\u2019s bombings in Kabul and Khost didn\u2019t aim to show Taliban\u2019s strength \u2014 indeed, they served America. By those bombings they served the 2014 negative slogan,\u201d he said. \u201cThese bombings aimed to prolong the presence of the American forces in Afghanistan.\u201d         \n\nIn a separate complaint, Mr. Karzai said that on Saturday an Afghan engineering student in the southern city of Kandahar  \n at an American-run prison after being detained by Afghan forces backed by the C.I.A. Later, his spokesman said Mr. Karzai had asked that the C.I.A. hand over the Afghan forces that carried out the arrest and interrogation.         \n\nIn comments before the meeting between Mr. Karzai and Mr. Hagel, the new international military commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., insisted that the two countries were still getting along, saying, \u201cWe do not have a broken relationship.\u201d         \n\nHis view was echoed by Mr. Faizi, who said both Mr. Hagel and General Dunford had been responsive. \u201cThey understand our concerns, and Hagel noted that both sides should learn from their mistakes,\u201d Mr. Faizi said.         \n\nGeneral Dunford, however, contested Mr. Karzai\u2019s claim that the Americans were working at cross-purposes with the Afghan government and benefiting in any way from Taliban violence.         \n\n\u201cWe have fought too hard over the past 12 years, we have shed too much blood over the past 12 years, we have done too much to help the Afghan security forces grow over the past 12 years to ever think that violence or instability would be to our advantage,\u201d General Dunford told reporters traveling with Mr. Hagel.         \n\nAfghans analysts on Sunday pointed out that the immediate backdrop to Mr. Karzai\u2019s anger was the cancellation of the Bagram Prison hand-over, which humiliated him after he had announced to the Parliament in his inaugural address in January that Afghans were on the verge of taking control of Bagram\u2019s detention operations.         \n\n\u201cHis prestige as president was degraded in the eyes of the public by the Americans\u2019 refusal to hand over responsibility of the prison to the Afghans,\u201d said Atiqullah Amarkhel, a former Afghan Army general and a military analyst. \u201cI think it drives him crazy when he sees it\u2019s not happening.\u201d         \n\nMr. Amarkhel added: \u201cIt also shows a deep sense of distrust between two onetime allies. To the public, it means all the power is with foreigners.\u201d         \n\nFurther, Mr. Karzai\u2019s comments were directed as much at Afghans as at the West; among them are his fellow Pashtuns, who have been in areas where foreign troops and night raids, which are widely disliked, have been commonplace. Most recently, he has also been trying to bring the Taliban to the table for a peace deal, said Mohammed Natiqi, a political analyst based in Kabul.         \n\n\u201cHe has realized that Taliban will play an important role in the post-2014 Afghanistan,\u201d Mr. Natiqi said. \u201cAnd by banning night raids, airstrikes and criticizing Americans and NATO forces, President Karzai is trying to win over the Taliban and other insurgent groups.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/11/world/asia/karzai-accuses-us-and-taliban-of-colluding-in-afghanistan.html", "date": "2013-03-10", "description": "President Hamid Karzai charged that the American government and the Taliban had in effect colluded to keep Afghanistan unstable in order to justify a continued American military presence."}
