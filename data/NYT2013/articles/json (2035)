Spying", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Congressional critics of the National Security Agency program that collects the telephone records of millions of Americans stepped up their efforts as the Supreme Court on Monday turned away  \n to the scope of the surveillance.         \n\nThe intensifying push against the N.S.A. on both the legal and legislative fronts reflected new pressure being put on the extensive surveillance effort in the wake of revelations by the former N.S.A. contractor Edward J. Snowden, pressure that is running into stiff resistance from congressional leaders of both parties as well as the Obama administration.         \n\nThe  \n filed  \n directly with the Supreme Court, arguing that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court had \u201cexceeded its statutory jurisdiction when it ordered production of millions of domestic telephone records that cannot plausibly be relevant to an authorized investigation.\u201d         \n\nThe justices gave no reason for rejecting the group\u2019s petition, but the unusual procedure of bypassing the lower courts probably played a role. Other, more conventional challenges to government surveillance programs are pending.         \n\nIn urging the justices not to hear the case,  \n \u201cthe proper way\u201d to mount a challenge \u201cis to file an action in Federal District Court to enjoin the program, as other parties have done.\u201d         \n\nIt cautioned, though, that \u201cthe government may assert certain threshold defenses to such a suit.\u201d The case is In re Electronic Privacy Information Center, No. 13-58.         \n\nAfter the recent revelations about widespread government surveillance, civil liberties groups have filed fresh challenges in federal trial courts, saying they can now show that they have standing.         \n\nMembers of both parties are making a push for laws that would rein in N.S.A. data collection programs and bring more transparency to intelligence gathering. Those seeking to impose new requirements on the N.S.A. hope to take advantage of a small window of opportunity and attach their provisions onto an annual Pentagon policy measure now headed for Senate consideration.         \n\n\u201cWhen you have a train that is sure to reach the station, you want to add your car to that train,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut. \u201cEven if it means a battle.\u201d         \n\nBy raising new questions about the operations of these surveillance programs \u2014 whose disclosure by Mr. Snowden created one of the more disruptive episodes in Barack Obama\u2019s presidency \u2014 Congress seems set to provoke yet another uncomfortable public discussion for a White House struggling to overcome severe problems with its health law.         \n\nLeaders of both parties in Congress are hardly eager to see the issue come up again. In the Senate, Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, is wary of any measure that the White House thinks is harmful to national security. He and other Senate leaders are considering erecting procedural barriers to amendments to the Pentagon legislation. The leadership resistance limits chances for quick success in the Senate.         \n\nIn the House, Speaker John A. Boehner has said he believes dealing with N.S.A. questions in the short time left this year would rush a process that should be longer and more deliberative.         \n\nBut lawmakers like Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon and one of the Senate\u2019s strongest critics of mass surveillance, and Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, who has tried to bring greater attention to national security practices he argues are unchecked, see no reason to wait.         \n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m going to zero in on,\u201d Mr. Wyden said in an interview, \u201cis much of what the intelligence leadership in the past has been misleading about, has shrouded in incomprehensible intelligence-speak or has just been flat-out wrong.\u201d         \n\nHe added that he thought the timing with the pending defense bill was ideal. \u201cI think there\u2019s an opportunity to work with senators of varying different views to set the record straight about the government\u2019s surveillance authority and jump-start the broader debate about intelligence reform,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe amendment Mr. Wyden has been circulating in recent days to colleagues would create a battery of new disclosure requirements for the intelligence agencies, including public reports on how often they have conducted mass digital sweeps that enable them to track cellphones, and on how many times they have violated their own privacy rules and safeguards.
