{"headline": "Breaking Free of the Cellphone Carrier Conspiracy", "body": "\nWhere, exactly, is your threshold for outrage?         \n\nWould you speak up if you were overbilled for a meal? Would you complain if you paid for a book from Amazon.com that never arrived?         \n\nOr what if you had to keep making monthly  \n payments even after your loan was fully repaid?         \n\nWell, guess what? If you\u2019re like most people, you\u2019re participating in exactly that kind of rip-off right now. It\u2019s the Great Cellphone Subsidy Con.         \n\nWhen you buy a cellphone \u2014 an  \n or Android phone, let\u2019s say \u2014 you pay $200. Now, the real price for that sophisticated piece of electronics is around $600. But Verizon, AT&T and Sprint are very thoughtful. They subsidize the phone. Your $200 is a down payment. You pay off the remaining $400 over the course of your two-year contract.         \n\nIt\u2019s just like buying a house or a car: you put some cash down and pay the rest in installments. Right?         \n\nWrong. Here\u2019s the difference: Once you\u2019ve finished paying off your handset, your monthly bill doesn\u2019t go down. You keep reimbursing the cellphone company as though you still owed it. Forever.         \n\nAnd speaking of the two-year contract, why aren\u2019t you outraged about that? What other service in modern life locks you in for two years? Home phone service? Cable TV service? Internet? Magazine subscriptions? Baby sitter? Lawn maintenance? In any other industry, you can switch to a rival if you ever become unhappy. Companies have to work for your loyalty.         \n\nBut not in the cellphone industry. If you try to leave your cellphone carrier before two years are up, you\u2019re slapped with a penalty of hundreds of dollars.         \n\nIf you\u2019re not outraged by those rip-offs, maybe it\u2019s because you think you\u2019re helpless. All of the Big Four carriers follow the same rules, so, you know \u2014 what are you gonna do?         \n\nLast week, the landscape changed. T-Mobile violated the unwritten conspiracy code of cellphone carriers. It admitted that the emperors have no clothes. John J. Legere, T-Mobile\u2019s chief executive, took to the stage not only to expose the usurious schemes, but to announce that it wouldn\u2019t be playing those games anymore.         \n\nIt was a Steve Jobs moment: when somebody got so fed up with the shoddy way some business is being run (say, phone design or selling music) that he reinvented it, disruptively.         \n\nAt the new T-Mobile, the Great Cellphone Subsidy Con is over. You can buy your phone outright, if you like \u2014 an iPhone 5 is $580, a Samsung Galaxy S III is $550. Or you can treat it like a car or a house: pay $100 for the phone now, and pay off the rest over time, $20 a month.         \n\nThat may sound like the existing phone subsidy con, but it\u2019s different in a few big ways. You pay only what the phone really costs. You don\u2019t pay interest, and you stop paying when you\u2019ve paid for the phone; in other words, your monthly bill will drop by $20 a month, just as it should. (You can also pay it off sooner, if you like. If you have a good month and want to put, say, $70 toward your phone payoff, that\u2019s fine.)         \n\nT-Mobile doesn\u2019t care what phone you use, either; if it works on T-Mobile\u2019s network, you can use it. And why not? Why shouldn\u2019t you buy one phone you really love, and use it freely as you hop from carrier to carrier? Would you buy a car that uses only one brand of gas?         \n\nYet another radical change: There are no more yearly contracts at T-Mobile. You can leave at any time. \u201cIf we suck this month, drop us,\u201d said Mr. Legere. \u201cGo somewhere else.\u201d         \n\nIn the new T-Mobile world, there are only three plans.         \n\nAll come with unlimited phone calls, unlimited texts, free tethering (which allows your laptop to get online via your phone) and unlimited Internet. The only difference among the plans is how much high-speed wireless Internet you get each month: 500 megabytes ($50 a month), 2 gigabytes ($60) or unlimited ($70).
