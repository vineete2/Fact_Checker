{"headline": "Europeans Planted Seeds of Crisis in Cyprus", "body": "\nNICOSIA, Cyprus \u2014 When European finance chiefs explained their harsh terms for rescuing Cyprus this week, many blamed the tiny Mediterranean nation\u2019s wayward banking practices for bringing ruin on itself.         \n\nBut the path that led to Cyprus\u2019s current crisis \u2014 big banks bereft of money, a government in disarray and citizens filled with angry despair \u2014 leads back, at least in part, to a fateful decision made 17 months ago by the same guardians of financial discipline that now demand that Cyprus shape up.         \n\nThat decision, like the onerous bailout package for Cyprus announced early Monday, was sealed in Brussels in secretive emergency sessions in the dead of night in late October 2011. That was when the European Union, then struggling to contain a debt crisis in Greece, effectively planted a time bomb that would blow a big hole in Cyprus\u2019s banking system \u2014 and set off a chain reaction of unintended and ever escalating ugly consequences.         \n\n\u201cIt was 3 o\u2019clock in the morning,\u201d recalled Kikis Kazamias, Cyprus\u2019s finance minister at the time. \u201cI was not happy. Nobody was happy, but what could we do?\u201d         \n\nHe was in Brussels as European leaders and the International Monetary Fund engineered a 50 percent write-down of Greek government bonds. This meant that those holding the bonds \u2014 notably the then-cash-rich banks of the Greek-speaking Republic of Cyprus \u2014 would lose at least half the money they thought they had. Eventual losses came close to 75 percent of the bonds\u2019 face value.         \n\nThe action had an anodyne name \u2014 private-sector involvement, or P.S.I. \u2014 and, it seemed at the time, a worthy goal: forcing private investors to share some of the burden of shoring up Greece\u2019s crumbling finances. \u201cWe Europeans showed tonight that we reached the right conclusions,\u201d Chancellor Angela Merkelof Germany announced at the time.         \n\nFor Cypriot banks, particularly Laiki Bank, at the center of the current storm, however, these conclusions foretold a disaster: Altogether, they lost more than four billion euros, a huge amount in a country with a gross domestic product of just 18 billion euros. Laiki, also known as Cyprus Popular Bank, alone took a hit of 2.3 billion euros, according to its 2011 annual report.         \n\nWhat happened between the overnight session in 2011 and the one that ended early Monday morning is a study of how decisions made in closed conference rooms in Brussels \u2014 often in the middle of the night and invariably couched in impenetrable jargon \u2014 help explain why the so-called European project keeps getting blindsided by a cascade of crises.         \n\n\u201cI cannot remember that European policy makers have seen anything coming throughout the euro crisis,\u201d said Paul de Grauwe, a professor at the London School of Economics and a former adviser at the European Commission. \u201cThe general rule is that they do not see problems coming.\u201d         \n\nSimon O\u2019Connor, the spokesman for the union\u2019s economic and monetary affairs commissioner, Olli Rehn, declined to comment on whether Mr. Rehn had taken a position on the possible impact of the Greek debt write-down on Cypriot banks.         \n\nAs well as hitting Cyprus over its banks\u2019 holdings of Greek bonds, the European Union also abruptly raised the amount of capital all European banks needed to hold in order to be considered solvent. This move, too, had good intentions \u2014 making sure that banks had a cushion to fall back on. But it helped drain confidence, the most important asset in banking.         \n\n\u201cThe bar suddenly got higher,\u201d said Fiona Mullen, director of Sapienta Economics, a Nicosia-based consulting firm. \u201cIt was a sign of how the E.U. keeps moving the goal posts.\u201d         \n\nCyprus, she added, \u201ccreated plenty of its own problems\u201d and was not aided by the fact that the country\u2019s last president, a communist who left office in February, and his central bank chief were barely on speaking terms. But decisions and perceptions formed more than 1,500 miles away in Brussels and Berlin \u201cdidn\u2019t help and often hurt,\u201d Ms. Mullen said.
