{"headline": "Widespread Flaws Found in Ovarian Cancer Treatment", "body": "\nMost women with ovarian cancer receive inadequate care and miss out on treatments that could add a year or more to their lives, a new study has found.         \n\nThe results highlight what many experts say is a neglected problem: widespread, persistent flaws in the care of women with this disease, which kills 15,000 a year in the United States. About 22,000 new cases are diagnosed annually, most of them discovered at an advanced stage and needing aggressive treatment. Worldwide, there are about 200,000 new cases a year.         \n\nCancer specialists around the country say the main reason for the poor care is that most women are treated by doctors and hospitals that see few cases of the disease and lack expertise in the complex surgery and chemotherapy that can prolong life.         \n\n\u201cIf we could just make sure that women get to the people who are trained to take care of them, the impact would be much greater than that of any new chemotherapy drug or biological agent,\u201d said Dr. Robert E. Bristow, the director of gynecologic oncology at the University of California, Irvine, and lead author of the new study presented on Monday  \n in Los Angeles.         \n\nThe study found that only a little more than a third of patients received the best possible care, confirming a troubling pattern that other studies have also documented.         \n\nKaren Mason, 61, from Pitman, N.J., had been a nurse for 28 years when she was found to have ovarian cancer in 2001. She scheduled surgery with her gynecologist, who was not a cancer surgeon.         \n\nBut her sisters would not allow it. They had gone on the Internet, and became convinced \u2014 rightly, according to experts \u2014 that she should go to a major cancer center.         \n\n\u201cThey took the reins out of my hands,\u201d Ms. Mason said.         \n\nShe wound up having a long, complicated and successful operation performed by a gynecologic oncologist, which she does not believe her gynecologist could have done.         \n\nDr. Barbara A. Goff, a professor of gynecologic oncology at the University of Washington, in Seattle, who was not part of Dr. Bristow\u2019s study, said the problem with ovarian cancer care was clear: \u201cWe\u2019re not making the most use of things that we know work well.\u201d         \n\nWhat works best is meticulous, extensive surgery and aggressive chemotherapy. Ovarian cancer spreads inside the abdomen, and studies have shown that survival improves if women have surgery called debulking, to remove all visible traces of the disease. Taking out as much cancer as possible gives the drugs a better chance of killing whatever is left. The surgery may involve removing the spleen, parts of the intestine, stomach and other organs, as well as the reproductive system.         \n\nThe operations should be done by gynecologic oncologists, said Dr. Deborah Armstrong of Johns Hopkins University, who is not a surgeon. But many women, she said, are operated on by general surgeons and gynecologists.         \n\nSome women prefer the obstetricians who delivered their children. Many are desperate to start treatment and think there is no time to find a specialist. Some do not know that gynecologic oncologists exist. Some inexperienced doctors may find the cancer unexpectedly during surgery and try to remove it, but not do a thorough job.         \n\n\u201cIf this was breast cancer, and two-thirds of women were not getting guideline care that improves survival, you know what kind of hue and cry there would be,\u201d said Dr. Armstrong, who was not involved in the study. But in ovarian cancer, she said: \u201cThere\u2019s not as big an advocacy community. The women are a little older, sicker and less prone to be activists.\u201d         \n\nOne patient advocacy group, the  \n, ranks the availability of a gynecologic oncologist as one of its criteria in comparing the quality of care among states.         \n\nSurgeons who lack expertise in ovarian cancer should refer women to specialists if the women are suspected to have the disease, but often do not, Dr. Goff said.         \n\nDr. Bristow\u2019s research, which has been submitted to a medical journal but not yet published, was based on the medical records of 13,321 women with ovarian cancer diagnosed from 1999 to 2006 in California. They had the most common type, called epithelial. Only 37 percent received treatment that adhered to  \n set by the  \n, an alliance of 21 major cancer centers with expert panels that analyze research and recommend treatments. The guidelines for ovarian cancer specify surgical procedures and chemotherapy, depending on the stage of the disease.         \n\nSurgeons who operated on 10 or more women a year for ovarian cancer, and hospitals that treated 20 or more a year, were more likely to stick to the guidelines, the study found. And their patients lived longer. Among women with advanced disease \u2014 the stage at which ovarian cancer is usually first found \u2014 35 percent survived at least five years if their care met the guidelines, compared with 25 percent of those whose care fell short.
