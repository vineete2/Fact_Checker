{"headline": "A Quiet Meal, Polluted by Noise", "body": "\nI recently met a friend for lunch at a popular bistro new to both of us. We arrived and quickly found seats by the window. The d\u00e9cor was lovely, and the menu looked terrific.         \n\nBut the music was way too loud.         \n\nWe wanted to enjoy a conversation, not shout at each other over Taylor Swift. So we politely asked our waiter if he would turn down the music.         \n\n\u201cSure,\u201d he said, and strode off.         \n\nAfter a moment, the music changed \u2014 it became even louder.         \n\nWhen another waiter cruised by, we asked if he knew how to work the sound system.         \n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he said.         \n\n\u201cCould you turn the music down a little?\u201d we asked.         \n\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d he said.         \n\nWe waited. The music continued at deafening levels.         \n\nSo we gave up and left. We ended up eating at a drab little place around the corner. The food was barely adequate and the ambiance nil, but we could enjoy a chat instead of hollering at each other over \u201cWe Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.\u201d         \n\nWere we being oversensitive? The next day, I asked around. Turns out that not one of my boomer pals appreciates loud background music. Not one of us enters a restaurant, encounters a blasting soundtrack, and thinks: \u201cGreat! I won\u2019t be able to hear myself think in here, let alone have an intelligent conversation. I LOVE this place.\u201d         \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. I love loud music. I came of age in \u201860s Detroit, a child of Motown. Some of my happiest memories are of dancing to a record player blasting \u201cYou Can\u2019t Hurry Love.\u201d         \n\nAs a D.J. at my college radio station, I went to so many deafening rock concerts that my ears are still ringing.         \n\nThere\u2019s a time and a place for a Wall of Sound. If you\u2019re driving down the freeway and Aretha comes on, you\u2019re supposed to turn it up. And when you\u2019re listening to a new song by your favorite band, you don\u2019t want it whispering in the background. You want it to take over the room and grab your heart.         \n\nBut sometimes loud music is just a pain in the ears.         \n\nMy favorite inn has a great infinity pool. It used to be the most peaceful place in the world. It was a splurge, but I returned for a week every summer. Swimming in that pool was pure bliss.         \n\nLast year, the inn began blaring a Golden Oldies soundtrack poolside. If you swam, or tried to read by the pool, you were accompanied by \u201cRunaround Sue,\u201d \u201cLeader of the Pack\u201d and \u201cBorn to Run.\u201d         \n\nI love Bruce Springsteen. But I didn\u2019t want him in the water with me.         \n\nI asked around. Were other vacationers enjoying this?         \n\nMost weren\u2019t.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to screen it out,\u201d one said.         \n\n\u201cIt makes it hard to read,\u201d another said.         \n\nBut some folks loved the music. \u201cIt\u2019s festive,\u201d I was told. \u201cIt\u2019s lively and upbeat. It feels like a party.\u201d         \n\nThe music was there for a purpose. It created a mood.         \n\nUnfortunately, the only mood I wanted was \u201cpeace and quiet.\u201d         \n\nUnlike some of my friends, I don\u2019t get angry when a place blares loud music. This is a free country. The management can pound \u201cCall Me Maybe\u201d or \u201cRunaround Sue\u201d until my teeth rattle. It has every right to play whatever it wants, as loud as it wants to.         \n\nAnd I have a right to flee.         \n\nWhen Barbara and I walked out of that noisy bistro, it lost two potential customers: women with both the time and the disposable income to enjoy an upscale lunch.         \n\nCan restaurants afford to keep losing customers like us?         \n\nMaybe they can. In fact, this place might have been happy to see us go. If the loud music is there to make it seem hip and happening, the last thing it may want folks to see when they look in the window to check it out is a couple of librarians.         \n\nIf I were a little more paranoid, I might even suspect they\u2019d deliberately turned up the music to get rid of us.         \n\nI imagine managers in trendy bistros all over Manhattan, saying to the wait staff: \u201cQuick! A couple of Eileen Fisher-clad, peace-loving AARP types just came in. Turn up the music and drive them out, or our reputation as a trendy eatery is doomed!\u201d         \n\nI\u2019m glad that I work in a public library, where quiet is the norm. Although we don\u2019t encourage patrons to nosh in the stacks, perhaps we ought to rethink that. Like many libraries, we desperately need to raise funds. Maybe after hours we can reopen as Library Bistro, a place where folks could enjoy a quiet meal and good conversation.         \n\nWant to book a table? Great. I\u2019ll put you on the list.
