{"headline": "Cheers, Hugs, Flags and Brooms Fill Victory Party at Unlikely Host Club", "body": "\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The corner table on the small deck overlooking the bay was marked \u201cSpithill,\u201d and the parents, wife, sister and brother of the Oracle Team USA skipper alternated their anxious gaze from the boats on the water to the tiny screens of iPads in front of them.         \n\nAs Jimmy Spithill expertly steered the 72-foot catamaran back and forth \u2014 left to right, then right to left, then left to right again toward the finish line \u2014 the nervous patter from inside the cramped Golden Gate Yacht Club turned to victorious cheers. Oracle Team USA had completed an astounding comeback, winning the final eight races of the America\u2019s Cup to defend the trophy with an all-or-nothing victory Wednesday.         \n\nThe Spithills were enveloped in hugs. The club, its roof lined with Oracle flags that clapped in the wind, was wrapped in a mix of joy and disbelief. The trophy was staying put.         \n\nA chant of \u201cU.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\u201d broke out, and no one mentioned that 10 of the 11 sailors on the Oracle boat were not American, including Spithill, an Australian. His wife, Jenn, though, is from San Diego, and wore stars-and-stripes tights \u2014 stars on the left leg, red-and-white stripes on the right.         \n\nThe Golden Gate Yacht Club remains just the sixth host club in the 162-year history of the America\u2019s Cup, and the unlikeliest. Founded in 1939 as a boat club for the working class, it was $453,000 in debt when it heard that  \n, the Oracle founder and billionaire yachtsman, wanted to mount a challenge for the America\u2019s Cup in 2003. Ellison, needing a sponsoring club, first negotiated with the St. Francis Yacht Club, the far larger and stylish neighbor of the Golden Gate.         \n\nWhen those talks dissolved, the desperate Golden Gate was among those offering its services. Ellison bit. He and 100 crew members joined the Golden Gate, their dues helping rescue the club from ruin.         \n\nEllison\u2019s bid for the America\u2019s Cup fell short in 2003, and again in 2007. But his team won in Spain in 2010, bringing this year\u2019s event to San Francisco and the silver trophy to the tiny club.         \n\nThe club\u2019s rags-to-riches ride among the yachting elite looked to be over 10 days ago. Emirates Team New Zealand held an 8-1 lead in the best-of-17 series. Golden Gate\u2019s general manager, a congenial man named Bob Mulhern, held a meeting with the club\u2019s five-person staff.         \n\nIt had been a long summer. For weeks, at the mercy of the vagaries of racing and wind, the crew had to plan and postpone and replan impromptu daily parties for 100 people or more in a club with no kitchen. It will all be over in a day or two, Mulhern told them. Hang in there.         \n\nBut the Golden Gate\u2019s run was extended again and again by Oracle Team USA\u2019s sudden winning streak. At midday Wednesday, with the score improbably tied, 8-8, Mulhern welcomed the arriving crowd before the final race, \u201cfueled by caffeine and nicotine,\u201d he joked.         \n\nMulhern expected 175 people for the finale, but more arrived. He squeezed them all into the upstairs dining room because he had rented out the lower-level club room for a business meeting (an Oracle meeting, coincidentally) when he presumed that the racing would be long over.         \n\nRound tables shrouded in white tablecloths filled the bright room, its three walls of windows capturing a view from the Golden Gate Bridge on one end to the Bay Bridge on the other. A table was piled with boxed lunches \u2014 roast beef, chicken or caprese sandwiches, all on sourdough. The eight-stool bar was crowded by people having mixed drinks poured into blue Solo cups. Bottles of Corona and Anchor Steam jammed the refrigerator, along with a supply of sparkling wine, in anticipation of a celebration.         \n\nMost were dressed in yacht-club casual, jeans or khaki pants with button-down shirts for men, lots of slacks and scarves for women. A man named Jim Flaherty wore flip-flops on his feet and an American flag as a cape. He carried a broom. His 14-year-old son, Andy, missed school for the occasion. His wife, Larie, carried a plate of a particular fuzzy fruit with bright green flesh and black seeds on the inside.         \n\n\u201cKiwis on a platter?\u201d she offered.
