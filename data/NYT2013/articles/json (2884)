{"headline": "Caught in a Revolving Door of Unemployment", "body": "\nOn a cold October morning, just after the federal government shutdown came to an end, Jenner Barrington-Ward headed into court in Boston to declare bankruptcy.         \n\nIt took weeks to put the paperwork together, given that her papers and belongings were scattered across the country \u2014 there was a broken-down car and boxes of paperwork in Virginia Beach, clothes in Colorado and personal possessions at a friend\u2019s house in Somerville, Mass. She managed to estimate her income \u2014 maybe $5,000 last year, but maybe half that this year \u2014 from odd jobs. Soon, she would officially have nothing.         \n\nIt has been a painful slide. A five-year spell of unemployment has slowly scrubbed away nearly every vestige of Ms. Barrington-Ward\u2019s middle-class life. She is a 53-year-old college graduate who worked steadily for three decades. She is now broke and homeless.         \n\nMs. Barrington-Ward describes it as \u201cmy journey through hell.\u201d She was laid off from an administrative position at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2008; she had earned about $50,000 that year. With the recession spurring employers to dump hundreds of thousands of workers a month and the unemployment rate climbing to the double digits, she found that no matter the number of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s she sent out \u2014 she stopped counting in the thousands \u2014 she could not find work.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been turned down from McDonald\u2019s because I was told I was too articulate,\u201d she says. \u201cI got denied a job scrubbing toilets because I didn\u2019t speak Spanish and turned away from a laundromat because I was \u2018too pretty.\u2019 I\u2019ve also been told point-blank to my face, \u2018We don\u2019t hire the unemployed.\u2019 And the two times I got real interest from a prospective employer, the credit check ended it immediately.\u201d         \n\nFor Ms. Barrington-Ward, joblessness itself has become a trap, an impediment to finding a job. Economists see it the same way, concerned that joblessness lasting more than six months is a major factor preventing people from getting rehired, with potentially grave consequences for tens of millions of Americans.         \n\nThe long-term jobless, after all, tend to be in poorer health, and to have higher rates of suicide and strained  \n. Even the children of the long-term unemployed see lower earnings down the road.         \n\nThe consequences are grave for the country, too: lost production, increased social spending, decreased tax revenue and slower growth. Policy makers and academics are now asking whether an improving economy might absorb those workers in time to prevent long-term economic damage.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we know the answer,\u201d said  \n, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cBut right now, I think everybody\u2019s worst fears are coming true, as far as we can tell.\u201d         \n\nSoon after we first talked in October, Ms. Barrington-Ward left her sister\u2019s house in Ohio, where she had crashed for six weeks, and went back to Boston and filed her bankruptcy paperwork. She contacted a headhunter. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get a job,\u201d she said. \u201cI just have to.\u201d She had two job interviews lined up and her fingers crossed.         \n\nLong-term joblessness \u2014 the kind that Ms. Barrington-Ward and about four million others are experiencing \u2014 is now one of the defining realities of the American work force.         \n\nThe unemployment rate has fallen to  \n, down from 10 percent four years ago. Private businesses have added about 7.6 million positions over the same period. But while recent numbers show that there are about as many people unemployed for short periods as in 2007 \u2014 before the crisis hit \u2014 they also show that long-term joblessness is up 213 percent.         \n\nIn part, that\u2019s because people don\u2019t return to work in an orderly, first-fired, first-hired fashion. In any given month, a newly jobless worker has about a 20 to 30 percent chance of finding a new job. By the time he or she has been out of work for six months, though, the chance drops to one in 10,  \n by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.         \n\nFacing those kinds of odds, some of the long-term jobless have simply given up and dropped out of the labor force. So while official figures show that the number of long-term jobless has fallen steeply from its recessionary high of 6.7 million, many researchers fear that this number could mean as much bad news as good. Workers over 50 may be biding their time until they can start receiving  \n. Younger workers may be going to school to avoid a tough job market. Others may be going on disability, helping to explain that program\u2019s surging rolls.         \n\nStan Hampton, 59, a veteran of the Iraq war, is now earning his associate degree. But he has not had a job since returning from active duty in 2007, and is now living in an apartment complex for veterans near Las Vegas.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to hang on until my retirement kicks in,\u201d he said, though he stressed that he would still look for a job. \u201cI have not been in jail or prison, nor am I an alcoholic, drug addict or gambling addict. I am simply old, unemployed and out of money.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/business/caught-in-unemployments-revolving-door.html", "date": "2013-11-16", "description": "Some economists fear that the long-term unemployment crisis affecting millions of Americans might be a permanent change, with far-reaching and damaging consequences."}
