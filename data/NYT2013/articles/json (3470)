{"headline": "In Housing Court, Different View of New York City\u2019s Mayoral Race", "body": "\nA chill wind pinching his face, Compton Bremner takes his place among hundreds of men and women who clutch dispossess notices and rent receipts.         \n\nThis is Brooklyn\u2019s Housing Court, and the line he stands in snakes out the door and down Livingston Street. There are nurses\u2019 aides and child care workers, students and waitresses and delivery men.         \n\nMr. Bremner, 56, a sturdy block of a man, works in fire safety at a hospital. He and his wife are a month behind on rent owed to their landlord, with whom they are quarreling about repairs.         \n\nHis wife is burying her mother in Guyana. So he\u2019s here alone.         \n\nGuards herd him and 10 others onto an elevator that smells of Lysol. The doors open on the fourth floor and he steps into chaos: Tenants crowd benches; an elderly couple cries in the corner; and lawyers talk loudly into cellphones and pause occasionally to half-yell out for tenants.         \n\n\u201cMrs. Robinson? Mrs. Robinson? I need those receipts!\u201d         \n\nAn aging woman, her hair a thicket of gray, struggles to her feet and trundles over, holding her papers like holy script.         \n\nMr. Bremner speaks of his bottom line on this day: \u201cI just have to hold on to our apartment,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are working people who love this city. But we need our home.\u201d         \n\nOutside, behind the New Apollo Diner and a bail bondsman\u2019s office, three gleaming condo towers rise. That isn\u2019t this world. This is hanging-by-a-shoestring New York.         \n\n \n, the Democratic mayoral candidate, appears poised to win in a rout on Tuesday, in no small part because he talks of a city riven, with rich and poor, gilded and not so. His liberal patter has put the editorial pages of the city\u2019s tabloids in a fearful state. The New York Post ran a front page featuring a hammer and sickle, and a photograph of a smiling, presumably Red Bill.         \n\nThose hyperventilations feel absurd here. Last year, in a city with more than 50,000 homeless people, landlords commenced 217,914 legal actions for nonpayment of rent. That is slightly less than the population of Newark. In that same period, real wages in New York City declined by 4.5 percent.         \n\nIn miles-long swaths of the South Bronx and east Brooklyn and southeast Queens, a majority of tenants pay more than 50 percent of their income for rent. It\u2019s a desperate mathematics.         \n\nThe point isn\u2019t to argue that every tenant or beleaguered homeowner wears a halo. Years ago, I was a tenant organizer in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, and quickly came to recognize that the city\u2019s smaller landlords are only marginally less hard-pressed than tenants.         \n\nAnd the margins for error are achingly narrow.         \n\nI followed Mr. Bremner into a courtroom. It is dormouse quiet, with packed rows of tenants peering into space and folding their papers. A mother\u2019s lips move as she prays. Another woman reaches for her asthma nebulizer.         \n\nJudge Michelle Schreiber, polite and attentive, quizzes a woman, Valerie, who works two jobs and is caught up in a bureaucratic snarl with her federal housing assistance.         \n\n\u201cThe landlord says you owe $8,657.45,\u201d the judge says. \u201cHow are you going to pay this?\u201d         \n\nValerie\u2019s frown lines cut grooves across her forehead. She confesses that the money she owes is a mountain that cannot be scaled.         \n\nNext up is a former G.I. He was a medic in Afghanistan. Snipers there asked him to spot and count Afghans as they fell dead. \u201cI hoped to have a benevolent role,\u201d he says. \u201cI decided if I survived, I would go live in the place I saw on television. New York.\u201d         \n\nHe owes $2,800 in back rent. The Department of Veterans Affairs might help him. He hopes so; he says his landlord is a good man.         \n\nNext up is Mr. Bremner. He pays his back rent and keeps his apartment.         \n\nHe lives in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, and he and his wife like their neighbors. Change is at their doorstep; they live near the Barclays Center, gentrification\u2019s lodestar. They pay $911 for a two-bedroom. Two white kids moved in down the hall and pay twice as much.         \n\nHe speaks of this without rancor; he says the white kids have been priced out, too.         \n\nWho will he vote for? De Blasio, he says without hesitation.         \n\n\u201cWe love this city \u2014 order food at 3 a.m. and it shows up before you hang up the phone.\u201d His baritone laugh carries traces of his native Guyana. \u201cMr. de Blasio can make some inroads for us.\u201d         \n\nMay the new mayor be worthy of Mr. Bremner\u2019s hope.
