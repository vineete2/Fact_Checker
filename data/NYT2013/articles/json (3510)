{"headline": "Ohio Teenagers Guilty in Rape That Social Media Brought to Light", "body": "\nSTEUBENVILLE, Ohio \u2014 Two high school football stars were found guilty on Sunday of raping a 16-year-old girl last summer in a case that drew national attention for the way social media spurred the initial prosecution and later helped galvanize national outrage.         \n\nBecause the victim did not remember what had happened, scores of text messages and cellphone pictures provided much of the evidence. They were proof as well, some said, that Steubenville High School\u2019s powerhouse football team held too much sway over other teenagers, who documented and traded pictures of the assault while doing little or nothing to protect the girl.         \n\nOne of the football players, Trent Mays, 17, who had been a quarterback, was sentenced to serve at least two years in the state juvenile system. The other, Ma\u2019lik Richmond, 16, who had played wide receiver, was sentenced to serve at least one year. Both could end up in juvenile jail until they are 21, at the discretion of the State Department of Youth Services.         \n\nMr. Mays\u2019s minimum sentence is twice as long as Mr. Richmond\u2019s because he was found to be delinquent beyond a reasonable doubt \u2014 the juvenile equivalent of guilty \u2014 not just of rape but also of distributing a nude image of a minor.         \n\nAfter Judge Thomas Lipps read his decision in Juvenile Court, both boys sobbed. Mr. Richmond told his lawyer, Walter Madison, \u201cMy life is over.\u201d         \n\nMr. Mays apologized to the victim by name, as well as to her family and the community. \u201cNo pictures should have been sent around, let alone ever taken,\u201d he said.         \n\nMr. Richmond then walked toward the family and said: \u201cI had not intended to do anything like this. I\u2019m sorry to put you through this.\u201d After that he broke down, unable to speak, and embraced a court officer.         \n\nThe judge found that both boys used their fingers to penetrate the girl in the early hours of Aug. 12 while she was so drunk that she lacked the cognitive ability to give her consent for sex. A picture that was circulated among classmates later that day showed the victim naked and passed out. Ohio\u2019s legal definition of rape includes digital penetration.         \n\nJudge Lipps described much of the evidence as \u201cprofane and ugly.\u201d In sentencing the boys, he said rape was among the gravest of crimes and noted that they could have been tried as adults with far harsher punishments. He also said the case was a cautionary lesson in how teenagers conduct themselves when alcohol is present and in \u201chow you record things on social media that are so prevalent today.\u201d         \n\nThe trial also exposed the behavior of other teenagers, who wasted no time spreading photos and text messages with what many in the community felt was callousness or cruelty.         \n\nAnd that aspect of the case may not be complete. The Ohio attorney general,  \n, said after the verdict that he would convene a grand jury next month to finish the investigation.         \n\nIn an interview, Mr. DeWine said that while it was not clear that more people would face charges, prosecutors might consider offenses that include obstruction of justice, failure to report a felony and failure to report child abuse. State officials have interviewed almost 60 people \u2014 students, coaches, school officials and parents \u2014 but 16, most of them juveniles, have refused to speak to investigators.         \n\nThe verdict came after four days of testimony that was notable for how Ohio investigators analyzed hundreds of text messages from more than a dozen cellphones and created something like a real-time accounting of the assault.         \n\nAs these messages were read aloud, Judge Lipps heard Mr. Mays state that he had used his fingers to penetrate the girl, whom he referred to in a separate message as \u201clike a dead body.\u201d In another message, Mr. Mays admitted to the girl that he had taken the picture, already circulated among other students, of her lying naked in a basement with what he told her was his semen on her body, from what he stated was a consensual sex act.         \n\nOther text messages suggested that Mr. Mays had grown increasingly worried within a day or two, urging a friend to curb the distribution of a video related to the assault. He also seemed to try to orchestrate a cover-up, telling a friend, \u201cJust say she came to your house and passed out.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/18/us/teenagers-found-guilty-in-rape-in-steubenville-ohio.html", "date": "2013-03-17", "description": "The case of two high school football stars drew wide attention for the way social media spurred the initial prosecution and later helped galvanize national outrage over the episode."}
