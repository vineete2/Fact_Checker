{"headline": "At 52, Not Too Old for a Debut Novel", "body": "\nAmong the many things I wasn\u2019t prepared for after publishing my first novel at the age of 52 was the question I\u2019m asked most often. I\u2019ve heard it at book tour events in England, Germany, and here in the United States. The wording and language vary, but the gist of the question is the same: \u201cAren\u2019t you too old for this?\u201d         \n\nPeople ask for different reasons. Some mean it as a compliment. Young writers ask because they want to avoid the missteps that left me unpublished until such a frighteningly ancient age. Others hint that I must have wasted decades by indulging in foolish pursuits.         \n\nI used to answer that I wasn\u2019t too old for anything. I never agonized over not producing a book sooner and I never believed that my 30 years working as a musician were wasted. But the skepticism elicited by my response caused me to wonder if perhaps I wasn\u2019t being completely honest with audiences or myself.         \n\nSo for the first time in my life, I gave some thought to what I might actually be too old for. Two things came to me immediately. I am too old to drink to excess in public. Twenty-plus years ago, wildly drunken evenings with friends became fodder for stories that were cheerfully retold during slightly less drunken evenings with friends. I am also too old to pull off dressing anachronistically. In my younger days, I could slip into the clothing of a bygone decade and be admired for my free-spiritedness. If I were to venture outside today sporting a broad-collared, psychedelic print shirt, I would be mocked by strangers, and pitied by friends and family.         \n\nComing up with those first few things that I\u2019m too old for opened a gate, and other thoughts stepped forward.         \n\nWhen I was a younger man I assumed that the world would wait \u2014 wait for me to take action, wait for me to get myself together. But then I outlived friends: two men close to me died of drug overdoses, others from AIDS. I found myself applauding from the wings as bolder colleagues took advantage of opportunities I was too frightened or unprepared to seize. At 52, I\u2019m too old to believe that time is on my side.         \n\nI\u2019m too old for shortcuts. Well into my 30s, impatience drove me to seek out the fastest, most direct route to any goal. As a cello student, I focused my energies on preparing a showy piece for the next recital rather than doing the tedious and more time-consuming daily technical work like scales and etudes that would have been of greater benefit. In my early romantic relationships, I avoided the tough conversations that have to happen to achieve real emotional depth or to know when it is time to get out. I didn\u2019t say, what you\u2019re doing bothers me, we need to talk; I figured out ways to dodge the problem so we didn\u2019t have to talk.         \n\nFrom the time I was very young I honed my talent for mimicry that I later used to amuse others and to hide behind. At 10, I perfected an imitation of Tina Turner by spinning around in my bedroom to a recording of \u201cProud Mary\u201d with a Josie and the Pussycats bath towel tied to my head to simulate long hair. In my teens, I was a gay boy who tried, and failed, to be a straight boy. When I went to music school, rather than develop my own sound, I slavishly copied the tics and idiosyncrasies of my favorite cellists, the clean, pristine sounds of J\u00e1nos Starker, the arched phrasing of Bernard Greenhouse. Time spent on impersonations kept me from fully engaging in my own life and taking the risks every artist needs to take.         \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I reached 40 that I became truly at ease with my own voice, and when I applied the self-acceptance that came with maturity to my work as a cellist, I found that daily practice gained purpose and performances achieved greater depth. That new freedom had even more influence on a new medium for me, writing. I consider my writing career to have started when I was 42, because that was when I first finished a story. I had been starting stories for years, but never got past the middle. I was just not comfortable writing anything that revealed too much of myself.         \n\nBut once I was ready, and actually finished my first, I had a taste of success, winning a Chicago Public Radio contest and having the story published that same year.         \n\nI was 48 when I began the novel that would become \n and having found my voice, I was able to finish it in two years, just as I reached 50. What success the book has had I owe to that relatively new-found comfort with expressing my true nature.         \n\nFor better or worse, what I wrote came from me. This time I was not channeling the writers I admire \u2014 Dickens, John Irving, Toni Morrison \u2014 I was channeling Ed Moore. I had crossed a threshold, too old to imitate anyone.         \n\nI wrote a book with three black women as the central characters, drawn from the women I knew best\u2014my mother, my sister, aunts, and cousins.         \n\nI was never tempted to employ the tired trope of the sassy black bitch that popular culture has come to equate with a strong black woman \u2014 those awful \u201cHousewives of Atlanta,\u201d cursing, arrogant, selfish. Nothing like the women who raised me.         \n\nWhen I was a young man, I clung to the notion that a safe and ordered existence lay ahead for me, if I just followed the rules. I didn\u2019t know yet to ask who made the rules and why. And I didn\u2019t understand that obeying the rules provided no protection from the changes of fortune that shape every life. It took me a while to figure out that strict adherence to rules can slam the door to adventures like falling in love when you least expect it or writing a book for your own amusement that sprouts wings and becomes a best seller. Fortunately, I\u2019m too old to follow anyone else\u2019s rules.         \n\nSo, these days, the question \u201cAren\u2019t you too old for this?\u201d brings to mind a list of things that I\u2019m definitely too old for. But I answer, \u201cNo, at 52, I\u2019m not too old to be a debut novelist. But, luckily, I\u2019m way too old to be the writer, musician or man I was at 30.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/18/booming/at-52-not-too-old-for-a-debut-novel.html", "date": "2013-06-18", "description": "A writer comes to realize he is too old to follow anyone else\u2019s rules and can express his true nature."}
