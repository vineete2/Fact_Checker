{"headline": "Wanted: Schools Chief Who Has Never Crossed de Blasio on Education", "body": "\nWith a populist pitch forged by his own experiences as a public school parent,  \n surged to victory in New York\u2019s mayoral race thanks, in part, to his vow to shift away from Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s education policies.         \n\nBut two weeks before he takes office, Mayor-elect de Blasio has yet to pick a schools chancellor to carry out his own agenda. Indeed, while there is no shortage of people who would love to run the nation\u2019s largest school system, given Mr. de Blasio\u2019s own requirements, the pool of qualified candidates is actually quite small.         \n\nNo matter where he turns, it is almost impossible to find someone who has run a large school system in the last decade without having to close failing schools, expand charters or comply with state and federal guidelines on using tests to grade schools and teachers \u2014 all hallmarks of the education reform movement championed by Mayor Bloomberg, and all policies that Mr. de Blasio has said have serious flaws.         \n\nCarmen Fari\u00f1a, a former deputy chancellor and the candidate who most closely matches Mr. de Blasio\u2019s own thinking on education, was telling friends as recently as November that she was not interested in coming out of retirement and giving up her time spent helping raise her grandchildren.         \n\nBut the short list of candidates now seems to include her. Recently, Mr. de Blasio called Ms. Fari\u00f1a, 70, to see if she would reconsider her earlier reluctance, and she said she would, according to a longtime friend of Ms. Fari\u00f1a.         \n\nMs. Fari\u00f1a said in an interview on Tuesday that she did not know if she would be formally offered the job. But it is known, she said, \u201cthat Bill is a very persuasive person.\u201d         \n\n\u201cMy grandchildren are important to me,\u201d she added. \u201cI spent a lot of years in the system. But I will do whatever the new mayor wants me to do.\u201d         \n\nThe schools job is arguably one of the most difficult, and polarizing, anywhere. Whoever is chancellor will run by far the city\u2019s largest agency, and preside over a restless work force of teachers who have not had a contract in four years. And Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, will be facing political pressures to make good on his liberal platform.         \n\n\u201cI think of all the issues he ran on, there was nothing he was more passionate about in terms of the \u2018two New Yorks\u2019 than addressing education and equity,\u201d said Merryl H. Tisch, the chancellor of the State Board of Regents, referring to Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign slogan, \u201ca tale of two cities.\u201d         \n\n\u201cNo one who is in contention for this job would agree with all the campaign rhetoric,\u201d she added, \u201cand I think it is important to understand that there is a difference between campaigning and governing, and that does not mean that you walk away from all your principles as you govern. But it means you cultivate a list of choices of people who would cultivate your point of view without being in lock step.\u201d         \n\nWhen Mr. de Blasio is sworn in on Jan. 1, he will become the first mayor who is free to mold a school system from the outset, thanks to Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s hard-fought victory on mayoral control. And polls have consistently indicated that New Yorkers want Mr. de Blasio to do something different from Mr. Bloomberg to improve the schools.         \n\nLast year, when he was a Democrat in a crowded field of mayoral contenders, Mr. de Blasio said that candidates for chancellor should receive \u201cserious public screening,\u201d criticizing the way Mr. Bloomberg had appointed Cathleen P. Black, a publishing executive, as chancellor in 2010. She resigned after three months on the job.         \n\nMr. de Blasio has been consulting with education figures, like the education historian Diane Ravitch, but he, too, is conducting his search largely in private.         \n\n\u201cMayor-elect de Blasio continues to review candidates for chancellor,\u201d Lis Smith, a spokeswoman for Mr. de Blasio, said on Tuesday. \u201cAs a public-school parent, it\u2019s a decision he takes very seriously.\u201d         \n\nThe selection process has unfolded quite differently from that of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s other high-profile appointment: police commissioner.
