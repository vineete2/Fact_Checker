{"headline": "In China, Families Bet It All on College for Their Children", "body": "\nHANJING, China \u2014 Wu Yiebing has been going down coal shafts practically every workday of his life, wrestling an electric drill for $500 a month in the choking dust of claustrophobic tunnels, with one goal in mind: paying for his daughter\u2019s education.         \n\nHis wife, Cao Weiping, toils from dawn to sunset in orchards every day during apple season in May and June. She earns $12 a day tying little plastic bags one at a time around 3,000 young apples on trees, to protect them from insects. The rest of the year she works as a substitute store clerk, earning several dollars a day, all going toward their daughter\u2019s education.         \n\nMany families in the West sacrifice to put their children through school, saving for college educations that they hope will lead to a better life. Few efforts can compare with the heavy financial burden that millions of lower-income Chinese parents now endure as they push their children to obtain as much education as possible.         \n\nYet a college degree no longer ensures a well-paying job, because the number of graduates in China has quadrupled in the last decade.         \n\nMr. Wu and Mrs. Cao, who grew up in tiny villages in western China and became migrants in search of better-paying work, have scrimped their entire lives. For nearly two decades, they have lived in a cramped and drafty 200-square-foot house with a thatch roof. They have never owned a car. They do not take vacations \u2014 they have never seen the ocean. They have skipped traditional New Year trips to their ancestral village for up to five straight years to save on bus fares and gifts, and for Mr. Wu to earn extra holiday pay in the mines. Despite their frugality, they have essentially no retirement savings.         \n\nThanks to these sacrifices, their daughter, Wu Caoying, is now a 19-year-old college sophomore. She is among the growing millions of Chinese college students who have gone much farther than their parents could have dreamed when they were growing up. For all the hard work of Ms. Wu\u2019s father and mother, however, they aren\u2019t certain it will pay off. Their daughter is ambivalent about staying in school, where the tuition, room and board cost more than half her parents\u2019 combined annual income. A slightly above-average student, she thinks of dropping out, finding a job and earning money.         \n\n\u201cEvery time my daughter calls home, she says, \u2018I don\u2019t want to continue this,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mrs. Cao said. \u201cAnd I say, \u2018You\u2019ve got to keep studying to take care of us when we get old\u2019, and she says, \u2018That\u2019s too much pressure, I don\u2019t want to think about all that responsibility.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nMs. Wu dreams of working at a big company, but knows that many graduates end up jobless. \u201cI think I may start my own small company,\u201d she says, while acknowledging she doesn\u2019t have the money or experience to run one.         \n\nFor a rural parent in China, each year of higher education costs six to 15 months\u2019 labor, and it is hard for children from poor families to get scholarships or other government financial support. A year at the average private university in the United States similarly equals almost a year\u2019s income for the average wage earner, while an in-state public university costs about six months\u2019 pay, but financial aid is generally easier to obtain than in China. Moreover, an American family that spends half its income helping a child through college has more spending power with the other half of its income than a rural Chinese family earning less than $5,000 a year.         \n\nIt isn\u2019t just the cost of college that burdens Chinese parents. They face many fees associated with sending their children to elementary, middle and high schools. Many parents also hire tutors, so their children can score high enough on entrance exams to get into college. American families that invest heavily in their children\u2019s educations can fall back on Medicare, Social Security and other social programs in their old age. Chinese citizens who bet all of their savings on their children\u2019s educations have far fewer options if their offspring are unable to find a job on graduation.
