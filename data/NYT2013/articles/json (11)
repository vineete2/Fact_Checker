{"headline": "Agency Could Gain if Armstrong Confesses", "body": "\nDuring his battle with the  \n last year,  \n went to extreme lengths to disparage the agency, a quasi-governmental organization charged with policing banned drug use in Olympic sports.         \n\nHe called the organization a kangaroo court that flagrantly violated the Constitution and used taxpayer dollars to conduct witch hunts. He called its chief executive, Travis Tygart, an antidoping zealot with a vendetta against him even as the agency released more than 1,000 pages of evidence in October laying out the case that Armstrong had doped and had been a part of a sophisticated doping scheme on his cycling teams.         \n\nThe agency said Armstrong, a  \n survivor who had inspired millions fighting the disease, lied when he said he had never doped. It also said he destroyed the lives of people in cycling who dared to say he had used banned drugs.         \n\nYet within the last month, Armstrong\u2019s representatives reached out to Tygart to arrange a meeting between Armstrong and the agency. The goal of that meeting was to find out if a confession could mitigate Armstrong\u2019s lifetime ban from Olympic sports, according to several people with knowledge of the situation. Those people did not want their names published because it would jeopardize their access to sensitive information on the matter.         \n\nTygart welcomed the invitation, and that meeting occurred last month, one person familiar with the situation said. In the end, no matter how much Tygart and Armstrong had fought each other, they still need each other. Armstrong, 41, would like to resume competing in triathlons and running events that are sanctioned by organizations that follow the World Anti-Doping Code. Tygart wants to know how Armstrong so skillfully eluded testing positive for banned drugs for nearly a decade.         \n\nTim Herman, Armstrong\u2019s Austin-based lawyer, said that talks with Tygart and the antidoping agency are not on the table. Armstrong has not met with Tygart, Herman said.         \n\nTygart, who declined to comment, has said in the past that he is interested in hearing from athletes who doped because they could lead him to the coaches, agents, doctors, team owners or other sports personnel who organized or encouraged doping.         \n\n\u201cMr. Armstrong did not act alone,\u201d the antidoping agency wrote in its report on Armstrong. \u201cHe acted with a small army of enablers, including doping doctors, drug smugglers and others within the sport and on his team.\u201d         \n\nIf Tygart is able to gather incriminating information about those people and build cases against them that could bar them from sports, he could deal a serious blow to the doping that has been enmeshed in the culture of cycling for more than 100 years. Though 11 of Armstrong\u2019s former teammates provided some information about those enablers, it is very likely that Armstrong \u2014 who kept much of the doping secretive, according to some of his teammates \u2014 knows much more.         \n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very valuable to them to know exactly how Lance avoided getting caught and how tests were evaded,\u201d said Jonathan Vaughters, a former Armstrong teammate, a vocal antidoping proponent and a current co-owner of the Garmin-Sharp professional cycling team. \u201cThey need someone on the inside to tell them how it was done, and not just anyone on the inside, someone on the inside who was very influential. Someone like Lance.\u201d         \n\nVaughters said that a confession by Armstrong might encourage other riders to say what they knew and encourage a \u201ctruth and reconciliation\u201d effort, in which riders would not be penalized for confessing to doping if they detailed how they got away with it. That effort could educate authorities so those entities could bolster drug testing and close any loopholes, Vaughters said.         \n\n\u201cI feel like Lance\u2019s confession could push that effort forward dramatically,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, we almost have to destroy the sport in order to save it.\u201d         \n\nThe antidoping agency has already brought cases against five of Armstrong\u2019s former colleagues. Michele Ferrari, an Italian doctor and Armstrong\u2019s trainer, and Luis Garc\u00eda del Moral, a team doctor, have accepted lifetime bans. The three others who had worked on Armstrong\u2019s teams have requested that their cases go to arbitration: Johan Bruyneel, the team manager, who remains a powerful influence in the sport; Pepe Mart\u00ed, a team trainer; and Pedro Celaya, a team doctor.
