{"headline": "Player Ratings: U.S. (2) vs. Mexico (0)", "body": "\nFor the fourth straight World Cup cycle, the United States national team defeated Mexico by the same score. This 2-0 victory in Columbus, Ohio, was arguably the most impressive as it clinched a spot in the 2014 World Cup and jeopardized the chances for its archrival.         \n\nOn the heels of a disappointing loss to Costa Rica, in which it lost Jozy Altidore, Geoff Cameron, and Matt Besler to suspensions as well as perhaps its best player, Michael Bradley, to injury, the U.S team put forth a hard fought effort to earn a victory. When Honduras played Panama to a draw later in the night, the U.S team officially secured its seventh straight appearance in the World Cup.         \n\nMexico, who fired head coach Jos\u00e9 Manuel de la Torre on Saturday and replaced him with Luis Fernando Tena, dominated the first 15 minutes but had little to show for it. As the first half progressed, the U.S became more effective as the central midfield pairing of Kyle Beckerman and Jermaine Jones settled into the game.         \n\nAlso, the central defense tandem of Omar Gonzalez and Clarence Goodson continuously stifled the Mexican attack with ease throughout the night. Goodson was added to the roster on Saturday by Coach Jurgen Klinsmann but his veteran presence turned out to be vital in holding Mexico scoreless.         \n\nThe top story of the game, however, was unquestionably Landon Donovan. He has been a nemesis to the Mexican team ever since his goal in the round of 16 at the 2002 World Cup, when he helped lift the U.S team to a quarterfinal appearance. On Monday, he was once again dominant, assisting on the first goal and scoring the second.         \n\nMexico\u2019s chances to qualify are now in jeopardy. Historically, Mexico has been the most powerful team in Concacaf, but now it finds itself in a battle for fourth place just to make a playoff in November against New Zealand for one of the final World Cup spots.         \n\nThe ratings (on a scale of 1, diabolical; to 10, world class):         \n\n \n Recently, there have been doubts whether Howard was a guaranteed starter because backup Brad Guzan has been playing so well for Aston Villa. Against Mexico, Howard again showed why he is Klinsmann\u2019s first choice as keeper. The U.S team came out flat in the first half but Howard\u2019s saves on Giovanni Dos Santos in the 43rd minute and on Diego Reyes in the 45th kept the U.S in the game. Rating: 7.5         \n\n \n Playing for just the second time with the U.S team at right back, Johnson looked uneasy. He tried to push forward but was never able to deliver a dangerous final pass. Defensively, he was caught out of position a few times. He left the game at the half with a sore hamstring. Rating: 5.0         \n\n \n After being left off the initial roster for this round of World Cup qualifying, Goodson was added Saturday as an injury replacement. He seized the opportunity and played one of the best games of his career. He was rock solid defensively and Mexico rarely looked dangerous in the second half. He made a strong case that he should be on the team heading to Brazil next year. Rating: 7.5         \n\n \n Similarly to Goodson, Gonzalez put forth an impressive effort to all but ensure he will be on the U.S team at next year\u2019s World Cup. Gonzalez was sharp breaking up attacks and won most 50/50 balls in his area. Rating: 7.5         \n\n \n After a difficult outing on Friday against Costa Rica, Beasley was vastly improved at left back against Mexico. He struggled in the opening minutes and nearly mishit a clearance for an own-goal but gradually found his way into the game. The Mexican attack rarely had any success on his side in the second half. Rating: 6.0         \n\n \n It was a rough first 20 minutes for Jones but he gradually found his way into the game. In the second half he was controlling the midfield both offensively and defensively. This was one of his best performances in World Cup qualifying. Rating: 7.0         \n\n \n It was not an easy task to fill in for Michael Bradley but Beckerman did a solid job. He forced turnovers and limited Mexico\u2019s ability to attack up the middle of the field. His crisp passing helped the U.S maintain possession. He was one of several players who made a statement to be part of the team moving forward.
