{"headline": "Thriving on Chaos, Manziel Shocks a Traditional System", "body": "\n \n has grown into a multisponsored, million-footed behemoth, the urge to reduce each season to a few personalities has become ever more absurd, and more necessary. You have to believe there are some actual people under all those piles of money.         \n\nLast season, the sport gave us Texas A&M quarterback Johnny Manziel. The first freshman Heisman Trophy winner and the only quarterback to beat the machinelike Alabama Crimson Tide in 2012, Manziel was a marvel of watchability: talented when everything worked but a real genius of the busted play, one of football\u2019s great disaster capitalists.         \n\nAnd as we learned in the off-season, Manziel\u2019s gift for improvisation extends well beyond the field, into bars, casinos, fraternity parties and Twitter. For pundits facing seven long, dry months of injury reports and replay footage, Manziel was a windfall.         \n\nThe last college player to attract this level of attention was Tim Tebow, but Tebow was famous without being all that interesting: he was nice and polite and dependable, and at 2 a.m. on a Saturday, you pretty much knew where he was.         \n\nIn recent weeks, Manziel\u2019s flirtation with catastrophe appeared to be blossoming into a full-fledged romance after an ESPN report that he charged fees for autographs. If proved, the allegations could blow up his college career. Or they could lead to a backlash over the N.C.A.A.\u2019s rules on amateurism and blow up the whole system. Either outcome would make a sort of sense.         \n\nI was in Hoover, Ala., a few weeks before all this came out, and stopped by the annual Southeastern Conference Media Days carnival to watch him up close. After Kevin Sumlin, the Texas A&M coach, faced the stern accounting of reporters (\u201cI guess Johnny hasn\u2019t tweeted in more than a month; did you have anything to do with that decision?\u201d), Manziel was brought out, clearly unhappy about the chore but flashing his Muppet-like grin.         \n\nHis answers were fine: he talked about hype, focus, hanging out with the rapper Drake. But sticking to the script was never his appeal, so reporters trailed Manziel from interview to interview in hopes that he would start ad-libbing.         \n\nChase Goodbread of  \n did get something good enough to broadcast on Twitter, early in the morning when Manziel was at ESPN\u2019s \u201cCollege GameDay\u201d set and turned to a cameraman standing nearby. \u201cNice pants,\u201d he said.         \n\nThe next day, Nick Saban came.         \n\nCollege football is a coach\u2019s sport, and I suspect this is one reason it inspires its most intense loyalty in the Deep South. The South, like certain post-Soviet republics, has long had an inclination for the autocrat, the personality cult, the Big Daddy. Huey Long, George Wallace, Leander Perez, the white-suited planter baron, the omnipotent small-town sheriff. Bear Bryant, of course.         \n\nIt is at the University of Alabama where the doctrine of the Primacy of the Coach has perhaps its purest expression. There are people living right now whose given names are Bear and Saban, the way ancient Egyptian children were named after kings. There may be some parents in Michigan who named their son Schembechler, but I have not heard of them.         \n\nSince the first Heisman was awarded, in 1935, seven Notre Dame players have won, while Notre Dame has claimed eight national championships. Oklahoma\u2019s Heisman-to-championship ratio is five to seven. Ohio State\u2019s is seven to seven. This is a nice balance of individual and institution.         \n\nThe Tide\u2019s Heisman-to-championship ratio in this period is 1 to 11. We, the fans, boast about this.         \n\nNow we have Saban.         \n\nSaban\u2019s control over the program at Alabama is unparalleled. But that control is just a logistical extension of his coaching philosophy, which is called the Process, a name it happens to share with the Argentine military dictatorship. The Process is a way of thinking about effort and achievement that goes beyond football, and so it shapes every aspect of an Alabama player\u2019s life.
