{"headline": "Thompson Sees No Need to Bar a Police Tactic", "body": "\nThe aggressive era of stop-and-frisk policing in New York City is, in every sense of the word, on trial: the subject of a high-stakes federal court case, scorching denunciations from civil rights leaders and emotional calls for its dismantlement by liberal lawmakers.         \n\nBut in a stand that is surprising black leaders and worrying some allies, William C. Thompson Jr., the sole African-American candidate for mayor, is steadfastly unwilling to join the tear-it-down chorus.         \n\nInstead, Mr. Thompson is embracing elements of the polarizing crime-fighting strategy and winning praise from an unlikely duo deeply associated with it: Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.         \n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Thompson\u2019s restrained approach paid by far its biggest political dividend when a coalition of unions representing about 100,000 city law enforcement officials voted to endorse his Democratic campaign, making clear that what appealed to its members was his comparatively conservative posture on criminal justice, according to people told of the decision.         \n\nBut in a city whose racial politics are never far from view, Mr. Thompson\u2019s moderate stance on an issue that has consumed the city\u2019s black and Latino community is inflaming a number of high-profile African-American Democrats, even holding up the endorsement of a party stalwart, the Rev. Al Sharpton.         \n\nMr. Sharpton, who likens opposition to stop-and-frisk tactics to a snowballing social movement, has let Mr. Thompson know that he is displeased with his views on policing and should not assume that black voters will automatically support his candidacy.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to be distant from a social movement if you are going to run for mayor of this city, especially as a black candidate,\u201d Mr. Sharpton said in an interview. \u201cI have expressed this to Thompson.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThis,\u201d Mr. Sharpton added, \u201cis not a marginal issue.\u201d         \n\nMr. Thompson\u2019s message, more law-and-order than reactive liberal activist, is upending assumptions about a black candidate for mayor in a city where David N. Dinkins struggled with the perception that he could not control crime and urban decay in the early 1990s.         \n\nIn an interview, Mr. Thompson spoke of an \u201coverreaction to stop and frisk\u201d that he said glossed over its usefulness as a police tool, even as he forcefully criticized its excesses over the past few years.         \n\nAs rivals call for the abolition of stop-and-frisk tactics as a routine police procedure, and an independent inspector general to monitor the police, Mr. Thompson said the right way to curb abuses was by asserting his values on the Police Department when he becomes mayor, not through a patchwork of quick fixes that could hamstring him once in office.         \n\nHis criminal justice platform, he said, \u201cisn\u2019t about running for mayor; it\u2019s about governing.\u201d         \n\nStill, Mr. Thompson is now bucking the left wing of his party on three fronts: by pledging to keep stop-and-frisk operations as a crime-fighting tool; proposing an inspector general who operates within the Police Department, rather than outside of it (\u201cI don\u2019t want to create additional bureaucracy,\u201d he said); and opposing a City Council bill that would open state courts to legal claims of racial profiling by the Police Department. (He said it would divert precious city finances to endless legal bills.)         \n\nIn each case, at least one of his rivals in the mayor\u2019s race \u2014 and in some cases, several of them \u2014 has staked out territory to his left, forcing Mr. Thompson to defend his Democratic credentials on what are possibly the most emotional questions of the 2013 campaign.         \n\nDuring a candidate forum a few weeks ago, John C. Liu, a Democratic candidate, called on Mr. Thompson to join him in demanding the abolition of stop-and-frisk policing.         \n\nThe exchange that followed produced the most memorable \u2014 and poignantly personal \u2014 exchange in the mayor\u2019s race.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m the one who has to worry about my son getting shot on the street,\u201d Mr. Thompson thundered.         \n\nIn the interview, Mr. Thompson said he was deeply affected watching crime overtake and oppress neighborhoods like Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, where he grew up, in the early 1990s.
