{"headline": "With Burst of Energy, Thompson Tries to Escape His Opponents\u2019 Shadow", "body": "\nThe clock had just rounded midnight when William C. Thompson Jr. rolled into a diner in Inwood, eager to shake a hand, anyone\u2019s hand. Two hours later, he was meeting hospital workers and the head of the teachers\u2019 union at a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts in Brooklyn. By 3 a.m., he was in Harlem, holding a candlelight vigil for a young woman killed in a housing project. Then it was off to the Bronx, in an apron and hairnet, to inspect a meat processing plant in Hunts Point at 5 a.m.         \n\nMr. Thompson\u2019s 25-hour, 23-stop campaigning spree spanning Aug. 1 and 2 was, of course, an opportunity to meet voters who work all sorts of shifts all over New York. But it was also an effort to change the conversation about a mayoral campaign that has not been going his way.         \n\nThere were a lot of reasons to believe that this would be the year for Mr. Thompson. He was the Democratic nominee in 2009, when he stunned many by coming within five percentage points of unseating Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, despite being outspent by more than $100 million. He is the only African-American candidate in a city where whites are a minority. And, in a primary field of Democrats that many have deemed underwhelming, he has won praise for his even-tempered, deliberative approach to vexing issues.         \n\nBut Mr. Thompson has repeatedly been eclipsed by his flashier Democratic rivals, who are all younger, and louder, than he is.         \n\nChristine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, led the race for much of the year, until former Representative Anthony D. Weiner briefly rode notoriety into the field\u2019s top tier. This week, it is Bill de Blasio, the public advocate, who has commanded the attention,  \n and  \n, and once again relegating Mr. Thompson to third in both.         \n\nAnd throughout the year, pollsters have been noticing a startling reality: Even though this year is the fourth time Mr. Thompson has appeared on a citywide ballot, nearly half of New York voters in a Quinnipiac Poll taken last month said they still did not know enough about him to form an opinion.         \n\nMr. Thompson\u2019s campaign team says it is not worried about the candidate\u2019s relative lack of recognition. But in a conference call discussing his first television advertisements this week, Jonathan Prince, his chief strategist, described them as a \u201ccompelling reintroduction\u201d of Mr. Thompson.         \n\nAnd Mr. Thompson has appeared sensitive, of late, to any perceptions that he does not have the drive or the passion to be mayor. During his 25 hours of nonstop campaigning, he kept repeating: \u201cI haven\u2019t been tired. I\u2019ve been energized.\u201d         \n\nHe said in Harlem: \u201cWe\u2019re taking it to the next level. We are picking up energy. We are picking up momentum. We are in overdrive right now.\u201d In a televised debate on Tuesday, when the candidates were asked to name one thing about them that would surprise voters, he uttered an answer that seemed intended to change perceptions: \u201cIn almost any sport that I\u2019ve ever played, I\u2019m incredibly competitive. Uh,  \ncompetitive.\u201d         \n\nMr. Thompson has long been reluctant to accept any blame for his 2009 defeat. He rejects the notion, often put forward by analysts, that his support was a protest against Mr. Bloomberg, rather than an endorsement of him. And he often suggests that his electoral performance was a victory, given the odds against him.         \n\nHis campaign this year has won support from a number of establishment figures and institutions, including unions representing firefighters, teachers and some police officers, as well as respected members of the state\u2019s political elite. They include two widely respected experts on New York\u2019s financial troubles, Richard Ravitch, the former lieutenant governor, and Felix G. Rohatyn, the investment banker, as well as Merryl H. Tisch, the chancellor of the State Board of Regents.         \n\n \n         \n\nAnd yet, polls show him stalled, usually in third place. So, despite insisting that public-opinion surveys underestimate black and Hispanic voters, he now appears to be recalibrating his original strategy, which essentially assumed that what nearly worked four years ago would be good enough this time.         \n\nNo longer is Mr. Thompson casting himself as a Bloomberg foil on a wide variety of matters, including term limits and income inequality. Rather, he has adopted more moderate stances on issues like policing, taxes and even Mr. Bloomberg, a political independent. The mayor has had his \u201cups and downs,\u201d Mr. Thompson told one Bloomberg critic at the Crown Heights subway station, but did a \u201cgreat\u201d job on gun control.         \n\nAnd while his campaign team \u2014 which itself was shaken up a few months ago, and now includes feistier outsiders with few ties to Mr. Thompson\u2019s Brooklyn machine roots \u2014 remains bullish about his odds, aides no longer talk solely about the demographic mathematical combinations that will propel him to a decisive victory without the need for a runoff. Instead, they express confidence that he will finish first or second and make the runoff, while infusing their conversations with buzzwords like accomplishments, maturity and temperament. They are also more apt to attack an opponent immediately rather than wait.
