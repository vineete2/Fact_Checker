{"headline": "You Named Me Brutus? Really?", "body": "\nWhat to name the new puppy?         \n\nFor our family, choosing a name was neither simple nor swift. After all, it had taken my daughters a decade of whining and deliberating over breeds that wouldn\u2019t aggravate the allergy-stricken (me), just to get to the point of agreeing to get a Havanese.         \n\nAnd because I am the family research queen, I found a way to make the process even more complicated. A little research elicited a lot of information.         \n\nI found lists of the most common dog names. A Web site with thousands of names, sorted into categories like \u201ccool,\u201d \u201ccute\u201d and \u201cunusual.\u201d And countless dos and don\u2019ts from self-anointed dog-naming experts.         \n\nIt was an art. A science. Serendipity. Intuition.         \n\nThere were phonetics rules. And rules that ignored phonetics, instead placing a premium on achieving family harmony. And, of course, there was a simmering debate: Whose needs should the name serve, yours or the dog\u2019s?         \n\nOne of the most consistent pieces of advice I found was to stick to names of one or two syllables, which quickly catch a puppy\u2019s attention.         \n\nPeople seem to drift in that direction anyway. At a recent puppy training class, I met Gracie, Nigel, Sasha and a schnauzer mix whose name was the perfect marriage of 21st-century preoccupations and \u00fcr-dogginess: Browser.         \n\nJoAnn Vela, the owner of Canine Cuties Dog Grooming, in Chicago Ridge, Ill., has four dogs: Moose, Bleu, Tyson and Coach. Moose, she explained, because their English mastiff was such a galumphing klutz. Bleu, because her daughter thought the dog looked so sad. Tyson, because her husband wanted the German shepherd to have a tough name. And Coach, because when her daughter gazed longingly at the Shetland sheepdog in a pet shop window, the dog gazed back longingly at her Coach purse.         \n\nThe four-syllable Gentleman Jack, of Cedar Grove, N.J., defies this rule. When Lauren Meyer, a stay-at-home mother who owns a Labradoodle, first saw a picture of him, she wanted to call him Jack, because she thought he looked like a frisky rogue. But her son insisted on a name with a little more class. At the time, he was a student at the University of Virginia, whose guiding spirit is the gentleman-scholar Thomas Jefferson. Also, the dog is whiskey-colored, and Gentleman Jack, it should be noted, is a brand of Jack Daniel\u2019s whiskey.         \n\nOn occasion, the name expands to six syllables. \u201cWhen he\u2019s bad,\u201d Mrs. Meyer said, \u201cwe call him Gentleman Jack Meyer.\u201d         \n\nAnother piece of advice: To help the puppy distinguish its name from ambient noise, choose something with a sibilant consonant or blend (an \u201cs,\u201d \u201csh\u201d or \u201czh\u201d) or, better still, a crisp, commanding consonant (a \u201ck\u201d or hard \u201cc\u201d).         \n\n \n a dog trainer and animal behaviorist in New Jersey, works with a bred-in-captivity wolf named Tacoma, and she named her own golden retriever-spitz mix Loki. \u201cThey can distinguish frequency ranges that we cannot, particularly dogs with pricked ears, which work almost like parabolic microphones,\u201d she said. \u201cThe hard consonant is a relatively sharp sound that the dog can respond to quickly. I think sibilant sounds are more muddled for them.\u201d         \n\nMrs. Vela recalled grooming a beagle named Tank. Some customers apparently don\u2019t look under the hood, so to speak. After the session, she informed the dog\u2019s owners that Tank was a Tinker (as in Tinkerbelle). Acceptance was hard.         \n\n\u201cThe husband and wife still each call the dog by a different name,\u201d Mrs. Vela said.         \n\nBut at least they abide by the rule.         \n\nSOME EXPERTS ALSO ADVISE picking a name that ends in a long vowel or a short \u201ca.\u201d         \n\n\u201cSimba?\u201d I asked my daughters. \u201cLobo? I know, let\u2019s call the puppy Orca!\u201d         \n\n\u201cJovi,\u201d they snickered, after Jon Bon.         \n\nMartin Deeley, a Florida trainer and executive director of the \n said he prefers names that end in a long \u201ce,\u201d like Benny or Dolly. \u201cI think it gives a nickname a loving touch,\u201d he said. \u201cSweet becomes Sweetie.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/04/garden/the-art-of-naming-a-dog.html", "date": "2013-04-03", "description": "Finding the right name for a dog can require research, debate and phonetic analysis."}
