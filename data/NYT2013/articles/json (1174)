{"headline": "A Chicago Cocktail Crawl", "body": "\nChicago bars have a way with a resonant cultural reference.         \n\nOne is named after a late-1800s White Sox outfielder turned temperance evangelist. A cocktail pioneer in another part of the same neighborhood is named after a renowned street photographer. A 10-minute walk away is a gin-centric bar whose name comes from a word coined to describe those who drank illegally during Prohibition. And popping up in unexpected places is the name of Nelson Algren, the author of \u201cThe Man With the Golden Arm,\u201d and perhaps most pertinently, \u201cChicago, City on the Make.\u201d         \n\nCocktail bars across the country are pouring the past (resurrected recipes, speakeasy motifs, barkeeps with Smith Brothers beards) and earnestly so. In Chicago, some of the most engaging bars seem to specialize in what could best be described as studious fun. The history lessons come with a lilt, and the innovation with an intense enthusiasm.         \n\nLogan Square, on the northwest side of Chicago, is a locus of interesting, grown-up drinking. An excellent base camp from which to explore the area (and beyond) is Longman & Eagle, a restaurant and bar where travelers can also book a diligently designed room upstairs. (The bar is a fine place to have a Root & Rye cocktail made with root tea, Rittenhouse rye and the mellow, wine-based amaro called Cardamaro.)         \n\nAlgren never slept here \u2014 it opened in 2010, 29 years after his death \u2014 but some of his words live on a Longman & Eagle wall, much-quoted lines from the novel \u201cA Walk on the Wild Side\u201d: \u201cNever play cards with a man called Doc. Never eat at a place called Mom\u2019s. Never sleep with a woman whose troubles are worse than your own.\u201d         \n\n \n         \n\n\u201cIt certainly was not without a sense of humor, naming a cocktail bar after a gentleman who spent the majority of his life preaching against the evils of alcohol,\u201d said Alex Bachman, the bartender at the animated spot across from the square that gave the neighborhood its name.         \n\nBut it wasn\u2019t necessarily intended to mock, either: \u201cOne thing I definitely admired was, he had a great conviction to what he believed in,\u201d Mr. Bachman said. (Then again, Billy Sunday the outfielder had a lifetime batting average of .248.)         \nAlex Bachman behind the bar at Billy Sunday. \n\n \n the bar can be winningly cheeky: The savory Box Lunch \u2014 made with goat\u2019s milk; oats and spices like mace and cinnamon; palo cortado sherry; and G\u00e9n\u00e9pi wormwood liqueur \u2014 is served in a small milk bottle complete with striped straw. The food menu includes a category called Things in Jars (the oven-roasted tomatoes are top-notch). The playlist assembled by John Byron, the floor manager, features welcome Dylan (\u201cChanging of the Guards\u201d) and a wonderfully weird cover of \u201cCrimson and Clover\u201d by the Chilean band Aguaturbia.         \n\nThere is a nod to Algren here as well, with a sprightly cocktail called the Algren Sling \u2014 New Western gin, pineapple, Three Pins herbal liqueur, lemon and Angostura bitters accented with cherries. It is served in a cup made of a coconut shell (\u201cDried and polished but very much real,\u201d Mr. Bachman said).         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had a deep appreciation for Nelson Algren, how he wrote about Chicago,\u201d said Mr. Bachman, who grew up on the North Side and whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes work in the beverage program at the restaurant of the late Charlie Trotter. \u201cI would never go as far as to say that he would drink Singapore Slings during his life, but it\u2019s just a tip of the hat to him in the small way that we could.\u201d         \n\nMr. Bachman\u2019s point of pride is the back bar\u2019s bottles of amaro and fernet, and it shows in his breakdown of the invigorating, biting drink called the Victorian, created here. \u201cWe wanted to showcase a spirit-forward cocktail that embraced a lot of the herbal components of amaro, so we used gin \u2014 the great botanical spirit that it is \u2014 as a vehicle to carry that very deep herbaceous character of the amaro and fernet Angelico,\u201d he said.
