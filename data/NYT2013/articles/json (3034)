{"headline": "Chinese Way of Doing Business: In Cash We Trust", "body": "\nSHANGHAI \u2014 Lin Lu remembers the day last December when a Chinese businessman showed up at the car dealership he works for in north China and paid for a new BMW 5 Series Gran Turismo \u2014 entirely in cash.         \n\n\u201cHe drove here with two friends in a beat-up Honda,\u201d Mr. Lin recalled. \u201cOne of his friends carried about $60,000 in a big white bag, and the buyer had the rest in a heavy black backpack.\u201d         \n\nLugging nearly $130,000 in cash into a dealership might sound bizarre, but it\u2019s not exactly uncommon in China, where hotel bills, jewelry purchases and even the lecture fees for visiting scholars are routinely settled with thick wads of renminbi, China\u2019s currency.         \n\nThis is a country, after all, where home buyers make down payments with trunks filled with cash. And big-city law firms have been known to hire armored cars to deliver the cash needed to pay monthly salaries.         \n\nFor all China\u2019s modern trappings \u2014 the new superhighways,  \n networks and soaring skyscrapers \u2014 analysts say this country still prefers to pay for things the old-fashioned way, with ledgers, bill-counting machines and cold, hard cash.         \n\nMany experts say it is not a refusal to enter the 21st century as much as wariness, of the government toward its citizens and vice versa.         \n\nDoing business in China takes a lot of cash because Chinese authorities refuse to print any bill larger than the 100-renminbi note. That\u2019s equivalent to $16. Since 1988, the 100-renminbi note, graced by Mao Zedong\u2019s visage, has been the largest note in circulation, even though the economy has grown fiftyfold. (The country\u2019s national icon, Chairman Mao, appears on nearly every note: the 1-, 5-, 10-, 20, 50- and 100- renminbi note.)         \n\nChinese economists and government officials often suggest that printing larger denomination notes might fuel inflation. But there is another reason.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m convinced the government doesn\u2019t want a larger bill because of corruption,\u201d said Nicholas R. Lardy, a leading authority on the Chinese economy at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, noting that it would help facilitate corrupt payments to officials. \u201cInstead of trunks filled with cash bribes you\u2019d have people using envelopes. And there\u2019d be more cash leaving the country.\u201d         \n\nAll the buying, bribing and hoarding forces China to print a lot of paper money. China, which a millennium ago was the first government to print paper money, accounts for about 40 percent of all global paper currency output, according to a report published by the China Banknote Printing and Minting Corporation. Adjusting for the size of its economy, China has about five times as much cash in circulation as the United States.         \n\nIn the United States, the highest denomination printed is $100; in Japan, it is the 10,000-yen note, worth about $100; the 500 is the highest-denomination euro note, worth about $650. No major economy has limited itself to such a low denominated bill as China.         \n\nBy making the 100-renminbi note the largest bill, the nation\u2019s citizens need more of it to buy a television or Swiss watch, never mind a car, home or a yacht, which China\u2019s state-run media said was bought a few years ago by men bearing two suitcases filled with cash.         \n\nFollowing those paper bills as they course through this booming economy offers a fascinating glimpse into how China\u2019s financial system works, and how parts of the country remain stuck in yesteryear.         \n\n\u201cIn large parts of China, it still looks like the U.S. in the 1950s: most everything is in cash,\u201d said Jeffrey R. Williams, executive director of the Harvard Center Shanghai and a former bank executive who has worked in China for more than 30 years. \u201cIn the U.S., you might have one bill-counting machine at a bank, but here every teller has one.\u201d         \n\nAlthough China\u2019s coastal cities have flourished during the 30 years of economic prosperity, economists say the country\u2019s interior remains poor and disconnected from the more modern aspects of the financial grid. As a result, the poor prefer to do business in cash.
