As we grow up, the world begins to be shaped by rules.         \n\nYou are a girl, so at a certain age you should no longer play soccer with boys. You are not fast or aggressive enough to succeed playing for the women\u2019s soccer program at the University of North Carolina. That trick with the ball is impossible. You shouldn\u2019t devote all your time and energy to soccer because you will burn out from the lack of balance. All of this is logical, but all of this is wrong.         \n\nI\u2019m laying in the same bed in my parents\u2019 house in which I slept as a 9-year-old. I\u2019m 27. No home of my own home; I have a job that is incredibly unstable; and I get paid to play a game. I am on a continual mission to find fulfillment from a journey with no destination. None of this is logical, yet all of this is right.         \n\nThroughout my career, I\u2019ve had to make tough decisions. I opted out of playing for my high school team to train with boys\u2019 teams. I decided to play for a college program that didn\u2019t suit my playing style, and that I knew would be an incredible challenge. I chose to leave my hometown team, Sky Blue, after two seasons in Women\u2019s Professional Soccer (W.P.S.) to play for the Western New York Flash.         \n\nThen, in the absence of a women\u2019s professional league in the U.S., I traveled to Russia and then Sweden to continue my career. When the N.W.S.L. was announced, I decided to stay in Sweden instead of terminating my existing contract to return for the inaugural season of the new league. Most recently, I decided not to re-sign with my team in Gothenburg, Sweden, and return to the U.S. to play in the N.W.S.L. for the 2014 season.         \n\n\u201cIf you do what everyone else does, you will get what everyone else gets.\u201d This clich\u00e9d quotation has become my truth. None of the situations I\u2019ve faced have correct answers. And I don\u2019t live by logic because passion has the power to trump logic.         \n\nLogic tells me what I\u2019m  \ndo. Logic tells me to put a timeline on my goals. Logic tells me to compare myself to other players. But I say that logic is for those bound by fear. It explains the world if you don\u2019t have the guts to explain it your own way. Everything extraordinary \u2014 passion, faith, love \u2014 goes against logic.         \n\nSometimes you need to let yourself believe in the possibilities rather than protect yourself with the realities or patterns that have come before. If you buy into what\u2019s logical you\u2019ll only prove those previous patterns right. It\u2019s when you step outside the norm that the most extraordinary things can happen.         \n\nWhen I lace up my boots there is no room for logic.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/04/sports/soccer/soccer-and-logic-dont-often-mix.html", "date": "2013-12-03", "description": "In a long soccer career, the writer has come to believe that logic is for those bound by fear."}
