{"headline": "Robots, Ducks and Awesome Swag", "body": "\nCHICAGO \u2014 There are few phrases in the English language that bore an 8-year-old more than \u201ctrade show.\u201d \u201cAgricultural field trip\u201d might qualify, or maybe \u201cindoor summer camp.\u201d But to draw a truly blank stare, tell a second grader that the two of you are headed to an expo on kitchen, bath and living-room accessories.         \n\nWhen I recently explained to my son, Jake, that we would be making a pilgrimage to the four-day  \n in Chicago, he seemed completely stultified.         \n\n\u201cIs it like furniture?\u201d he asked. Then he added hopefully, \u201cAre there, like, rides?\u201d         \n\nWell, like, no. But the show offers its own brand of amusement, especially when you\u2019re not a salesman or a buyer desperately trying to find an awesome smoothie maker or the world\u2019s next Snuggie. With thousands of new, old and sometimes bizarre products, the housewares show is an annual celebration of innovation and entrepreneurial optimism, with row upon row of ideas, from the sleek, high-end (like the elegant trapeze lamps from  \n) to the undoubtedly lowbrow (one example: the pet-potty accessory known as Cat Wipes).         \n\nMy idea was to allow Jake to act as scout and product tester, on the theory that many decisions in the home are influenced by children, a hunch confirmed by Tom Mirabile, the senior vice president for global trend and design at  \n, a housewares company, who believes that buying a blender can be a form of bonding.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re entering a period when a lot of Gen X and Gen Y parents are teaching their kids life skills that they are realizing will be important, and that includes home-ec skills,\u201d Mr. Mirabile said, adding that many on-the-go families consider time spent in the kitchen to be family time.         \n\n\u201cFor boomers, cooking and baking wasn\u2019t cool. Now it\u2019s another point of engagement with their children.\u201d         \n\nThat was exactly the type of engagement I was hoping for when Jake and I arrived at McCormick Place, this city\u2019s sprawling lakeside convention center, last Saturday, the first day of the show. There were a few complications, of course \u2014 namely that Jake was suffering from a sore foot. It was a bad sign, because if there\u2019s one requirement for attending a housewares show, it is being ambulatory. \u201cWalking the show\u201d is a familiar expression for both scouting the opposition and hunting for the next big thingamajig, a process that can require covering miles. But Jake\u2019s pain seemed to ease shortly after he was introduced to another time-honored trade show concept: swag.         \n\n\u201cCan we take the samples?\u201d he asked. Yes, I answered, as long as they\u2019re not so expensive that accepting them violates The New York Times\u2019s ethics policy.         \n\n\u201cSo can I have that cup of hot chocolate?\u201d he asked.         \n\nYes, I told him. Jake looked amazed.         \n\nOne advantage of going to a show like this with a child is that children tend to see things that adults might easily pass by. Such was the case with one of the first things Jake noticed: the  \n, which advertises itself (foolishly, it turns out) as a device that is practically accident proof. \u201cNever Spill Again\u201d is its motto.         \n\nJake took this as a challenge. \u201cThey say it can\u2019t be knocked over,\u201d he said. \u201cHow could it not be knocked over?\u201d         \n\nEn route to the Mighty Mug, mind you, we had already been waylaid several times. The housewares show is a big tent where brand-name manufacturers rub elbows with lesser-known companies like Arrow Plastic, a decidedly unflashy outfit from suburban Chicago that nonetheless occupied a central stall near the entrance. It was there that Jake discovered the  \n, a product whose name pretty much sums it up: It\u2019s plastic, it\u2019s a bowl and it has a straw that allows the user to consume the bowl\u2019s contents without using those pesky spoon things.         \n\nI was unimpressed, but for Jake this was a major innovation. \u201cSo if you have ice cream in the bottom, you can suck it up,\u201d he said, sounding astonished.         \n\nIndeed, many of the products he appreciated seemed to fall into one or more of the three F\u2019s: food, fun and funky. Firmly in the last category were the  \n. Created by the Finnish designer Eero Aarnio, they are just what they sound like: kitchen timers that look and sound like ducks. In other words, when they go off, they quack, something that delighted my son, who promptly decided to use several to set a \u201cduck bomb,\u201d whereby they would all quack at once.         \n\n\u201cThose people are going to be driven crazy,\u201d he said, grinning like a Bond villain.         \n\nWe left the booth as the countdown neared zero and found our way to  \n, a Danish design company. Jake\u2019s attention was instantly drawn to the Lego-style oversize plastic storage units. His favorites were the decapitated Lego heads \u2014 just the right size for a brain, he pointed out \u2014 which the company\u2019s representatives promised could be used to hold a variety of things, including lunch meat and dirty socks (but not, one would hope, at the same time). He also liked the bricks that were big enough to serve as a toy chest, which inspired a postmodern revelation. \u201cYou could put Legos,\u201d he said, \u201cin Legos.\u201d Whoa.         \n\nA similarly child-friendly ethos was on display at the booth for  \n, a Brooklyn-based company with a number of hip items, including a sneakily elegant iPod dock that converts your phone into an old-school alarm clock and a series of American flag spatulas by Jacob Wasserman, good for subtly patriotic July 4 cookouts. Jake\u2019s eye, however, was drawn to the  \n by David Weeks, a wooden action figure that folds into a small cube, just right for a boy\u2019s pocket.         \n\nIt was not by any means the only bot at the ball. Real robotics seemed to be a big trend in housewares, from newcomers like  \n, which introduced a frantic little device outfitted with bristles that scrambles around and cleans your barbecue, to corporations like  \n, which makes the remote-controlled Roomba vacuum that Jake enjoyed bossing around.         \n\n\u201cRobot!\u201d he shouted. \u201cClean!\u201d         \n\nNearby,  \n was offering the Winbot, a nifty new gadget that combines suction and squeegee technology and promises to clean your window \u2014 inside or out \u2014 in about five minutes. Jake tested its prowess by writing \u201cDork\u201d and \u201cJake Rocks\u201d on a pane of glass in the display. And sure enough, moments later the scribbles were gone.
