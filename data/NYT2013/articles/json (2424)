{"headline": "Republicans Expand I.R.S. Inquiry, With Eye on White House", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Congressional Republicans, not resting with the Internal Revenue Service scandal, are moving to broaden the matter to an array of tax malfeasances and \u201cintimidation tactics\u201d they hope will ensnare the White House.         \n\nRepublican charges range from clearly questionable actions to seemingly specious allegations, and they grow by the day. On Friday, lawmakers sought to tie the I.R.S. matter to the carrying out of President Obama\u2019s health care law, which will rely heavily on the agency. Whether they succeed holds significant ramifications for Mr. Obama, who will soon know if he is dealing with a late spring thunderstorm that may soon blow over or a consuming squall that will leave lasting damage.         \n\nRepresentative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan, the usually mild-mannered chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, set the tone Friday at Congress\u2019s first hearing on the targeting of conservative groups by the I.R.S., laying out details, from the alleged threatening of donors to conservative nonprofit groups to the leaking of confidential I.R.S. documents.         \n\nIn that context, he said, the screening of Tea Party groups for special scrutiny was not the scandal itself but \u201cjust the latest example of a culture of cover-ups \u2014 and political intimidation \u2014 in this administration.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIt seems like the truth is hidden from the American people just long enough to make it through an election,\u201d Mr. Camp said.         \n\nTaken aback, the ranking Democrat on the committee, Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, modified his prepared remarks to warn, \u201cIf this hearing becomes essentially a bootstrap to continue the campaign of 2012 and to prepare for 2014, we will be making a very, very serious mistake.\u201d         \n\nRepublicans raised a long list of issues. Mr. Camp contended, for instance, that a White House official\u2019s divulging of a private company\u2019s tax status constituted \u201ca clear intimidation tactic.\u201d The 2010 incident involved an offhand comment by the White House economist Austan Goolsbee that Koch Industries had not paid corporate income taxes because it pays taxes through the personal income tax code. As it turned out, that was not true, but the assertion was made in a discussion of tax reform ideas, not politics.         \n\nThe Republicans also criticized the publication of donors to the National Organization for Marriage, a group opposed to same-sex marriage. That donors list surfaced mysteriously in March 2012 from a whistle-blower whose identity is still unknown. The whistle-blower apparently obtained it by simply requesting it from the I.R.S.\u00a0         \n\nLinkage to the health care law came through Sarah Hall Ingram, a longtime I.R.S. official who has headed the agency\u2019s program to carry out the Affordable Care Act since December 2010. Before that, she led the I.R.S.\u2019s tax-exempt and government-entities division, which contained the political targeting effort.         \n\n\u201cThis is an audit, and it\u2019s helpful,\u201d Representative Tim Griffin, Republican of Arkansas, said of the investigation of I.R.S. targeting by the  \n, \u201cbut it\u2019s the tip of the iceberg.\u201d         \n\nBut the inspector general made clear that effort did not reach the attention of high-level I.R.S. officials until 2011 at the earliest.         \n\nThe inspector general gave Republicans some fodder Friday when he divulged that he informed the Treasury\u2019s general counsel he was auditing the I.R.S.\u2019s screening of politically active groups seeking tax exemptions on June 4, 2012. He told Deputy Treasury Secretary Neal Wolin \u201cshortly after,\u201d he said. That meant Obama administration officials were aware of the matter during the presidential campaign year.         \n\nThe disclosure last summer came as part of a routine briefing of the investigations that the inspector general would be conducting in the coming year, and he did not tell the officials of his conclusions that the targeting had been improper, he said.         \n\nTreasury officials stressed they did not know the results until March 2013, when the inspector presented a draft.         \n\n\u201cTreasury strongly supports the independent oversight of its three inspectors general, and it does not interfere in ongoing I.G. audits,\u201d the department said in a statement Friday evening.
