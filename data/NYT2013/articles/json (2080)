{"headline": "Illegal Immigrants Are Divided Over Importance of Citizenship", "body": "\nGlendy Mart\u00ednez is waiting anxiously to see if Congress will ever pass legislation to allow immigrants like her, without papers, to stay in the country legally. But frankly, she says, she does not care if it will include any promise of citizenship.         \n\nWith the earnings from her job in a Houston hair salon, Ms. Mart\u00ednez, 30, is supporting one child born in Texas and three others she left behind in her home country, Nicaragua.         \n\n\u201cSo many people back there depend on those of us who are here,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would be such a help if we could work in peace and go back sometimes to see our children.\u201d         \n\nAs President Obama looks for a way to salvage a broad overhaul of the immigration system, he opened the door this week to a piecemeal series of smaller bills as a way of getting past the objections of the Republican-run House, which refused to take up the comprehensive measure that the Senate passed in June.         \n\nBut as far as Ms. Mart\u00ednez and many other immigrants are concerned, one of House Republicans\u2019 sharpest disagreements with the Senate and the White House, over a path to citizenship for those here illegally, should not be that hard to resolve.         \n\n\u201cFor many undocumented people, citizenship is not a priority,\u201d said Oscar A. Chacon, executive director of the  \n, a network of immigrant organizations that includes many foreigners here without papers. \u201cWhat they really care about is a solution that allows them to overcome their greatest vulnerabilities.\u201d         \n\nThe Senate bill includes a 13-year pathway for 11.7 million illegal immigrants that ends with a chance to naturalize. President Obama and other supporters of that measure insist that any alternative would create a disenfranchised underclass. Many House Republicans reject the Senate path as rewarding immigrants who broke the law. But a growing number of Republicans say they remain ready to work on immigration and could consider legalization, if it did not involve any direct route to citizenship.         \n\nFor foreigners like Ms. Mart\u00ednez \u2014 those who cannot get a driver\u2019s license in most states and live with gnawing worry about being fired or deported \u2014 that would be enough. They aspire to become Americans, they said in phone interviews, but would settle for less if they could work and drive legally, and visit relatives outside the country.         \n\nAnother woman in Houston, Elena Sandoval, described a painful moment when her father died in El Salvador and she could not attend his funeral knowing she would not get back into the United States. Ms. Sandoval, 48, a house cleaner, sends money home for her three children.         \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how hard it is to leave your family,\u201d Ms. Sandoval said with a sigh. \u201cIf only I could have permission to move about freely,\u201d she added. \u201cCitizenship would just be a blessing we would pray for.\u201d         \n\nMost groups working for immigrant rights vehemently oppose any legislation that would deny millions of people the opportunity for full equality.         \n\n\u201cWe either have a path to citizenship or a path to hell,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Rodriguez, executive director of the  \n. \u201cTo codify a person who lives in this country but will never have an opportunity for citizenship creates a second class. It seems completely un-American.\u201d         \n\nAdvocates say the Senate\u2019s path \u2014 which requires illegal immigrants to pay fines and back taxes, study English, pass criminal checks and wait in line behind foreigners who applied legally \u2014 is sufficiently long and arduous. This month there have been rallies and protests nationwide and a fast on the National Mall to pressure the House to vote on a bill with citizenship.         \n\nBut among immigrants there is no consensus. In South Florida, there were anguished discussions over caf\u00e9 con leche and empanadas among members of Dreamers\u2019 Moms, a group of mothers of young immigrants who have joined the movement.         \n\n\u201cCitizenship is fundamental,\u201d insists Yaquel\u00edn L\u00f3pez, 46, a Bolivian who has been in the United States illegally for a decade. \u201cOtherwise we will be 11 million people left in limbo.\u201d         \n\nMarcela Espinal agrees.         \n\n\u201cWe have been working hard for our families and paying taxes all these years and we never lived off the government,\u201d said Ms. Espinal, 35, a Honduran employed for more than a decade in construction. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t we be able to vote someday?\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/21/us/illegal-immigrants-divided-over-the-importance-of-citizenship.html", "date": "2013-11-20", "description": "Congress\u2019s efforts on immigration have foundered over naturalization for those in the United States illegally.
