{"headline": "Dangers Come With Freedom for Indian Women", "body": "\nNEW DELHI \u2014 Often, after I have finished thrashing through a notebook to find quotations on some episode in the news, I put it on the shelf with a sneaking feeling that a different story is still there in its pages \u2014 something harder to put my finger on, but probably more important.         \n\nSo it is with violence against women in  \n. This is the theme sucking up all the oxygen this year, as we approach the anniversary of a gang rape on a bus in New Delhi. As a newcomer to India, I covered the death sentences handed down to four defendants in that crime (\u201cPhansi do! Phansi do!\u201d \u2014 which translates as \u201cHang them! Hang them!\u201d \u2014 was the first full phrase I learned in Hindi). This week, I pieced together the disparate perspectives on  \n.         \n\nIt is a dark picture, I know.         \n\nBut often when I return from a reporting trip, my overriding impression is of something completely different. Talking to Indian women on roadsides and in courtyards, in cities and in villages, I am struck by how swiftly they are expanding their freedoms.         \n\nConservative village elders may be searching for a way to slow that process \u2014 hence sporadic attempts,  \n, to keep blue jeans and mobile phones, those telltale signs of modernity, away from young women. The influence of village elders is diluted, however, when young people move into cities, and that is what much of India is doing. The whole country is changing at once.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s changing so rapidly that it\u2019s not even generational anymore, it\u2019s changing within a generation,\u201d is the way a colleague put it to me in a recent conversation.         \n\nWe were taking a breath, exhausted by a long conversation about violence and the more prosaic problem of how women can reach home safely after the end of the workday. I had already put away my notebook. But this, of course, was the flip side of the same conversation. New dangers are arising because women are expanding their perimeter.         \n\nSigns of this are everywhere.         \n\nOne story, unused, from my notebook: Rajkala Kanwar married into her husband\u2019s family, from the conservative Jat caste in the farming state of Haryana, understanding that she would occupy a subservient position. She, like her mother before her, would spend her youth under the authority of her mother-in-law, who would ensure that the younger woman never left the house without permission or failed to cover her head with the sheer scarf, or purdah, designed to spare older men the \u201cdisrespect\u201d of seeing her face.         \n\n\u201cWe lived in fear,\u201d said Ms. Kanwar, 60, remembering. Her husband, Ram, 70, nodded: \u201cAll this cruelty toward women,\u201d he said, \u201cwas by women.\u201d         \n\nThat power dynamic has changed. Ms. Kanwar smiled at the notion that she could maintain such a stranglehold over her sons\u2019 wives \u2014 they simply have too much leverage. If she tried to impose the same kind of restrictions, she said, her daughters-in-law would move to the city, taking her sons and grandchildren with them. So Ms. Kanwar, a practical woman, decided to remove purdah as a requirement for her daughters-in-law, and to stop wearing it herself. And, just like that, an old stricture was gone.         \n\n\u201cIt was difficult,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mother, my grandmother, they used to do it. My mother-in-law and her mother-in-law, they were doing it.\u201d         \n\nA generation ago, women in much of rural India spent their lives behind closed doors. Economic changes mean that women are flowing into India\u2019s public spaces, even in small cities and towns.         \n\nMy colleague Hari Kumar, a reporter in India for 20 years, recalls a time when, outside the large cities, the women one saw outside the home were mostly schoolteachers. But the economic overhauls of the early 1990s set off a major expansion of India\u2019s service sector, jobs like health, communication and education, banking and information technology. As the sector expanded to around 60 percent of India\u2019s gross domestic product from 40 percent, millions of Indian women began earning their own money \u2014 and spending it. Girls are routinely outperforming boys at the state board examinations that serve as the gateway to prestigious universities.         \n\nOf course, that information is of limited use to the woman who needs a safe way home at the end of a workday. We live in the short term; it will always command more surface area on the pages of newspapers. But there is a thrill in realizing that, somewhere beyond the fits and starts and backfires that make up our news cycle, there is a great engine that has begun to turn.         \n\n \n        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/30/world/asia/dangers-come-with-freedom-for-indian-women.html", "date": "2013-10-29", "description": "Women are quickly gaining new freedoms in India, but new dangers are also arising because women are expanding their perimeter."}
