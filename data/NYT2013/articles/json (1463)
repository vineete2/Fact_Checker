{"headline": "Data Leak Shakes Notion of Secret Offshore Havens and, Possibly, Nerves", "body": "\nBRUSSELS \u2014 They are a large and diverse group that includes a Spanish heiress; the daughter of the former Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos; and  \n, the former wife of the disgraced trader Marc Rich, who was pardoned by President Bill Clinton. But, according to a trove of secret financial information released Thursday, all have money and share a desire to hide it.         \n\nAnd, it seems safe to say, they \u2014 and thousands of others in Europe and far beyond, in places like Mongolia \u2014 are suddenly very anxious after the leak of 2.5 million files detailing the  \n accounts and shell companies of wealthy individuals and tax-averse companies.         \n\n\u201cThere will be people all over the world today who are now scared witless,\u201d said Richard Murphy, research director for  \n, a British-based organization that has long campaigned to end the secrecy that surrounds assets held in offshore havens. The leaked files include the names of 4,000 Americans, celebrities as well as more mundane doctors and dentists.         \n\nIt is not the first time leaks have dented a thick carapace of confidentiality that usually protects the identities of those who stash money in the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Liechtenstein and other havens. Nor, in most cases, is keeping money in such places illegal.         \n\nBut the enormous size of the data dump obtained by the  \n, a Washington-based group that, along with affiliated news media organizations, announced its coup on Thursday, has punched a big hole in the secrecy that surrounds what the Tax Justice Network estimates are assets worth at least $21 trillion held in offshore havens. \u201cThis could be a game-changer,\u201d said Mr. Murphy, the author of a book about offshore tax shelters. \u201cSecrecy is the key product these places sell. Whether you are a criminal laundering money or just someone trying to evade or avoid taxes, secrecy is the one thing you want.\u201d Once this is gone, he added, \u201cit creates an enormous fear factor\u201d and has a \u201cmassive deterrent effect.\u201d         \n\nAnd lifting the curtain on the identities of those who keep their money offshore is likely to cause particular anger in austerity-blighted Europe, where governments have been telling people to tighten their belts but have mostly turned a blind eye to wealthier citizens who skirt taxes with help from so-called offshore financial centers.         \n\nThe leaked records, mainly from the British Virgin Islands, the Cook Islands and Singapore, disclose proprietary information about more than 120,000 offshore companies and trusts and nearly 130,000 individuals and agents, including the wealthiest people in more than 170 countries. Not all of those named necessarily have secret bank accounts, and in some cases only conducted business through companies they control that are registered offshore.         \n\nThe embarrassment caused by Thursday\u2019s revelations has been particularly acute in France, where the Socialist president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who wants to impose a 75 percent tax on millionaires, has been struggling to contain a political firestorm touched off this week by a former budget minister\u2019s  \n \u2014 after months of denials \u2014 that he had secret foreign bank accounts.         \n\nThe scandal looked set to widen on Thursday as senior members of the government were forced to confront allegations that Mr. Hollande and others may have been aware that the budget minister, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Cahuzac, who resigned on March 19, was lying but failed to act.         \n\nAdding to the president\u2019s trouble, the name of a close friend and treasurer of his 2012 election campaign, Jean-Jacques Augier, appeared in connection with the files released Thursday by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. Mr. Augier, according to the newspaper Le Monde, was identified as an investor in offshore businesses in the Cayman Islands, another well-known tax haven.         \n\nMr. Augier, a friend of Mr. Hollande\u2019s, denied to Le Monde and Agence France-Presse that he had done anything illegal or improper. He said he had invested in funds that invested in China, and that he had no personal bank account in the Cayman Islands or any direct personal investment there. He conceded only that \u201cmaybe I lacked a bit of caution.\u201d         \n\nOthers identified included Maria Imelda Marcos Manotoc, a provincial governor and eldest daughter of the former Philippine president; Olga Shuvalova, the wife of Russia\u2019s deputy prime minister,  \n;  \n, a German playboy and photographer who committed suicide in May 2011 at age 78; and  \n, Spain\u2019s wealthiest art collector and the widow of a Thyssen steel company billionaire. The president of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, and his wife, Mehriban, were featured in the documents as having set up an offshore company in the British Virgin Islands, while their two daughters appeared in connection with three other offshore outfits.         \n\nThe consortium did not specify how it got the information or where it came from. On its Web site, the group said \u201cthe leaked files provide facts and figures \u2014 cash transfers, incorporation dates, links between companies and individuals \u2014 that illustrate how offshore financial secrecy has spread aggressively around the globe, allowing the wealthy and the well connected to dodge taxes and fueling corruption and economic woes in rich and poor nations alike.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/05/world/europe/vast-hidden-wealth-revealed-in-leaked-records.html", "date": "2013-04-04", "description": "The disclosures are likely to reverberate through government and financial circles, as austerity-ridden European governments seek to crack down on tax evasion."}
