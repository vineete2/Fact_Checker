{"headline": "U.S. and Israel Share a Goal in Iran Talks, but Not a Strategy", "body": "\nJERUSALEM \u2014 Fearing that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was on the verge of ordering an airstrike on Iran\u2019s nuclear plants, President Obama sent two emissaries here almost exactly a year ago to stop him. Warning that the White House could not abide an attack in the run-up to the November elections, the Americans persuaded the prime minister to give the newest sanctions time to bite, according to Americans and Israelis familiar with the tense exchanges.         \n\nDuring Mr. Obama\u2019s own visit here in March, he made clear, again, that if Iran truly got close to building a bomb, the United States would act, squashing talk of an Israeli strike since.         \n\nNow, Mr. Netanyahu sounds like a man who regrets not acting when he had the chance. In his  \n, followed by  \n and a series of private briefings, he has only grudgingly endorsed the negotiations between the West and Iran expected to start Oct. 15 in Geneva. As leaders in Washington and Europe increasingly acknowledge that Iran will most likely retain some nuclear fuel production capability, Mr. Netanyahu set out what most experts see as unrealistic conditions \u2014 a complete dismantlement of key nuclear facilities \u2014 and has repeatedly warned against relaxing sanctions until a deal is done.         \n\nBut while his United Nations address included the most explicit warning to date of a unilateral strike \u2014 \u201cIf Israel is forced to stand alone, Israel will stand alone\u201d \u2014 Israeli and other analysts say that Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s hands are now all but tied. Israel could hardly exercise its military option while the United States is negotiating, experts say, and would be hard-pressed to strike if Washington and its other allies reach a deal with Iran.         \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s cornered \u2014 is he going to spoil the international celebration and say, \u2018I think it\u2019s not a good enough deal so I\u2019m going to use the military option?' \u201d asked Michael Herzog, a retired Israeli brigadier general who is now a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cIf there is a good deal, it\u2019s a good deal for him as well. If there is no deal, he can go it alone, but if there is a bad deal, what can he do? He\u2019s trapped. That\u2019s his nightmare.\u201d         \n\nWhile Washington and Jerusalem have the same stated goal of stopping Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, there is a growing chasm over what might be the acceptable terms for an agreement. Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s new mantra is \u201cdistrust, dismantle and verify,\u201d and in  \n he insisted on \u201ca full dismantling of Iran\u2019s nuclear program,\u201d something Iran\u2019s new president, Hassan Rouhani, has made clear is unacceptable.         \n\nIsrael, like the Sunni Arab gulf states, also fears that resolving the nuclear issue would remove the primary instrument for containing Iran as a regional power. Lifting sanctions would not only signal new international legitimacy for Tehran, but it would also allow Iran to rebuild its hobbled economy, giving it the means to intervene all across the region, financing radical groups and promoting its ideology.         \n\nThe United States, on the other hand, sees broad benefits to a rapprochement. And while its official position is also that Iran must forgo major elements of its existing programs \u2014 including its 18,000 centrifuges, which enrich uranium, and a heavy-water reactor that could create another pathway to a bomb \u2014 Mr. Obama has not recently used the word \u201cdismantle\u201d in his own public comments. Instead he has simply said that Iran must prove its program is peaceful in nature, as Mr. Rouhani insists it is.         \n\nThat decision not to declare publicly that Iran must destroy much of what it has built \u201creally riled the Israelis on their trip,\u201d according to one former senior American official who met with some of them.         \n\nAn American involved in devising the West\u2019s negotiating strategy said, \u201cThe Israelis want to go back to where the Iranians were a decade ago.\u201d The American continued: \u201cNo one in the U.S. disagrees with that as a goal. The question is whether it\u2019s achievable, and whether it\u2019s better to have a small Iranian capacity that is closely watched, or to insist on eliminating their capacity altogether.\u201d         \n\nThere is also a continuing divergence on how far Iran is today from developing a bomb.         \n\nWhile American and Israeli intelligence agencies largely agree on their assessments, Mr. Netanyahu has chosen an aggressive interpretation of the evidence, that Iran is a few weeks or months from producing a weapon, while the White House maintains it remains a year or two away.
