{"headline": "Top Earners Recover Their Losses, and Then Some", "body": "\nFOR most Americans, the economy over the last 10 years has felt like a slog interrupted by a punch: the recession came amid years of stagnation. But for America\u2019s top earners, the experience has been more like whiplash: a boom followed by a bust followed by a boom.         \n\nCall it the 1 percent boomerang. The country\u2019s top earners lost huge sums during the recession, as housing values plummeted and the stock market crashed. But the recovery has restored those fortunes \u2014 and then some, for some people \u2014 and created tremendous new ones.         \n\nThe trend starts with the merely quite well-off, households earning more than about $150,000 a year. And the sums become more exaggerated higher up the income scale.         \n\nTake the average earnings of those in the top 0.01 percent: They plummeted from $30.67 million in 2007 to $18.24 million in 2009, before soaring to $27 million last year, according to Emmanuel Saez of the University of California, Berkeley, a researcher of American inequality and earnings. For the median-income household, income has slid from $55,627 to $53,285 to $51,017 at the same intervals. The number of American billionaires has whipsawed too, from 469 in 2008, to 359 during the crisis, and back up to 442 this year.         \n\n\u201cIf you didn\u2019t lose any money during the recession, it\u2019s because you did not have any money to begin with,\u201d said Milton Pedraza of the Luxury Institute, a boutique consultancy. \u201cIt\u2019s been a real bonanza since the end of 2009.\u201d         \n\nThat bonanza is evident in luxury sales, in the market for homes in places like Kiawah Island, S.C., and Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Mass., in bookings for private jets and in the return of nine-figure philanthropy. Chains like Burberry and Prada are expanding in the United States again. Sales of million-dollar homes shot up 37 percent from the first half of 2012 to the first half of 2013. And the growth in luxury-car sales is about twice as fast as it is for the more pedestrian Fords, Mazdas and Jeeps.         \n\nThe sums sloshing around are in some cases as big as before the recession, analysts said, but the conspicuous consumption has died down. \u201cPeople are not buying the red sports car or the orange sports car,\u201d Mr. Pedraza said. \u201cYou\u2019ll get a blue one instead.\u201d He also noted that \u201cas the wealthy get older, they\u2019re less interested in things and more interested in experiences,\u201d shifting spending into vacations and dining and away from yachts and jets.         \n\nSocially minded philanthropy has also become more prevalent since the recession, analysts said, as charitable giving, dominated by wealthier families in good times and bad, rises to close to its 2007 highs.         \n\n\u201cThese are 60-year-old men,\u201d said David Friedman, the president of Wealth-X, a firm that researches ultra-high-net-worth individuals. \u201cThey realize they\u2019re not immortal. And when they start to sense that mortality, they\u2019re going to be fueling luxury consumption and fueling philanthropy in a way the market\u2019s never seen.\u201d         \n\nOf course, the 1 percent or top 0.1 percent is not a static figure. Every year, millions of individuals and households move up or down the income scale depending on their earnings, investments and age. Fortunes wax and wane as new tech gurus graduate from college and top lawyers head into  \n.         \n\nStill, economists said that people holding considerable capital \u2014 de facto, the already rich \u2014 have done well during the recovery. Moreover, the 1 percent tends to be sticky, and perhaps even more so in bad times than in good times, Mr. Saez said. One study by the Treasury economists Gerald Auten, Geoffrey Gee and Nicholas Turner found that a quarter to a third of 1 percenters in a given year stayed in the 1 percent for all of the following five. . Thus, the profile of wealth in the United States, before the recession and after, has remained much the same.         \n\nThe prototypical high-net-worth individual is coastal, educated, older, white and male, Mr. Friedman said. The investor and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren E. Buffett, might not be coastal, but the other categories apply, and with cash on hand and an appetite for acquisitions during the recovery, his net worth has increased by about $10 billion over the last year.
