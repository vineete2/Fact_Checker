{"headline": "A Hot Duet for Those Cold Nights", "body": "\n \n         \n\nWhen the weather outside is frightful, \u201cBaby It\u2019s Cold Outside\u201d is one steamy goodbye. Written as a \u201cmouse and wolf\u201d duet in 1944 by Frank Loesser, he and his wife performed it at the end of a party they were hosting, to signal guests that the night was winding down. We all know about long goodbyes at the front door, but this hot exchange says nobody\u2019s going anywhere.         \n\nI don\u2019t know what it is about vintage holiday songs. They\u2019re a sweet escape from modern hype. When I listen, I see life in black and white, small waistlines, family dinners, a simpler time. If it wasn\u2019t simple back then, don\u2019t tell me \u2014 I don\u2019t want to know.         \n\nThis song has been covered every year since its release, by so many artists with such different styles, including Ray Charles, Louis Armstrong, Dolly Parton, Rod Stewart, Colbie Caillat, Tom Jones, James Taylor, Kelly Clarkson and this year even \n. But the version I\u2019m featuring is by one of my favorite new artists,  \n, who placed third in the 10th season of \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d (performed with  \n, a finalist that same season). Ms. Reinhart, whose debut album  \n came out last year, was raised on 1960s and \u201870s rock, played in her parents\u2019 band, studied jazz in college and blew the socks off the crowd at Lollapalooza two years ago (with her dad on guitar). This is one versatile young woman, as you\u2019ll see from this other cover and two originals.         \n\n \n         \nBaby it's cold outside \n\n \n         \nHaley Reinhart, Casey Abrams - Baby, It's Cold Outside \n\n \n         \nHaley Reinhart - What Is And What Should Never Be - Top 3 \n\n \n         \nLiar - Haley Reinhart (Lyrics) \nHaley Reinhart - \"Hit The Ground Runnin (Perez Hilton Acoustic Performance)\"", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/24/booming/a-hot-duet-for-those-cold-nights.html", "date": "2013-12-24", "description": "\u201cBaby It\u2019s Cold Outside\u201d has become a perennial favorite since its debut in 1944, and the many artists who have covered it now include Haley Reinhart."}
