{"headline": "Fine Dining Gets the Dim-Sum Treatment (Finally)", "body": "\nI first ate dim sum in 1968 at Nom Wah, on Doyers Street in New York\u2019s Chinatown. (The place is still there.) The appeal of the service style was immediate and tremendous \u2014 why couldn\u2019t every meal be an uninterrupted stream of small, exotic dishes brought to you on a gleaming (or at least functional) cart? I\u2019m quite sure that I said, either on that visit or one of the frequent ones that followed, \u201cSomeone needs to do this with non-Chinese food.\u201d         \n\nTasting menus and tapas bars came close, but nothing quite captured the spirit of the dim-sum cart. Until last year, when State Bird Provisions opened on Fillmore Street in San Francisco.         \n\nState Bird is the brainchild of a wife-and-husband team of native Californians, Nicole Krasinski and Stuart Brioza. After some years in the Midwest and a stint at Rubicon (the San Francisco fixture that closed in 2008), the couple took some time off (\u201cWe didn\u2019t think it would be three and a half years,\u201d Brioza said, \u201cbut that\u2019s the way it goes sometimes\u201d) and developed what, after more than a few hiccups, turned into a wildly popular and still evolving concept.         \n\nThe carts \u2014 at least half the food arrives that way, with the other half ordered off a menu \u2014 are uncommon to say the least. Although the concept is familiar to everyone at this point, these are laden not with the mostly brown and steamed food common to dim-sum parlors but with gorgeous, far-out, inventively served creations like kimchi yuba (tofu skin) with smoked egg; sweetbread meatballs with fig jam and pickled vegetables; lobster-and-lentil salad; and, yes, dumplings (guinea hen, with broth).         \n\nFor me, this is a dream come true, because I\u2019m pretty much a true omnivore: I will eat anything, and I love surprises. When I\u2019m in a restaurant with friends, I\u2019m happy to never open the menu and let others order, and there\u2019s nothing I like more than a table filled with food I can\u2019t even identify.         \n\nAnd State Bird goes beyond the surprise, producing a wild variety of avant-garde food that you really want to eat. What\u2019s happening here is the continuing evolution of highly trained, fine-dining-type chefs strutting their stuff in a casual atmosphere.         \n\nI went back to State Bird repeatedly and delightedly and finally asked Krasinski and Brioza if I could cook with them. It turned out that \u2014 this isn\u2019t shocking \u2014 many of their dishes were too complicated for me to deal with. But the ones we settled on, doable by anyone, are representative: highly flavored, unusual, delicious. For true authenticity, serve them on a cart.
