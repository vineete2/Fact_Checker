{"headline": "My Mother\u2019s Secret Heart Attack", "body": "\nI found out about my mother\u2019s heart attack by accident through a phone call from a hospital billing clerk.         \n\n\u201cWe have two different birthdays for her,\u201d she said.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d I replied. \u201cMy mom\u2019s not in the hospital.\u201d         \n\nThis was followed by an, \u201cOh my!\u201d and a frantic shuffling of papers. Then, a profuse apology.         \n\n\u201cI assumed that you would know since you are listed as her contact person. She\u2019s been here since Friday.\u201d         \n\nIt was Monday.         \n\nThen I was transferred to my mother\u2019s room in the cardiac intensive care unit in a Pittsburgh hospital, 300 miles from my home.         \n\nWhen my mother answered, she sounded surprised to hear my voice.         \n\n\u201cDid Virginia tell you?\u201d she asked. Virginia is her neighbor.         \n\nApparently Virginia knew that my mother had been taken to the hospital by ambulance in the throes of a heart attack and in need of emergency surgery. To the list of people who knew I could also add her neighbors Anne, Maryann and Lynne, and her sister, Joan, a reclusive soul who didn\u2019t know about 9/11 for a week. I assumed that the deli guy at Giant Eagle had been given a heads-up before me.         \n\nI explained, with anger rising in my voice, that Virginia had not enlightened me. I had been told by some poor clerk who probably wished she had not come to work that day.         \n\n\u201cI have to go now,\u201d she said quickly, \u201cThe doctor is here to see me. They are discharging me.\u201d         \n\nAnd then she was gone.         \n\nAfter calls home, my husband went into action to pack my suitcase. Then I left to drive six hours in the freezing rain before night came.         \n\nDuring the drive I called a colleague. When she heard the story, she asked, \u201cSo, you two aren\u2019t close?\u201d A laugh, more like a choke, escaped from my lips.         \n\nHow much closer could we be? My parents had, for all of my life, been two of my most valued relationships. I listened to dysfunctional family stories from my friends about whose parent behaved horribly at their wedding, who was drunk at the college graduation, and was grateful for the blessing of my parents.         \n\nJust weeks before, my mother had come to stay for a month. I took her for lunch at the Plaza. As we sat at the table, sipping the warm breakfast blend tea, she said, \u201cComing to the Plaza has always been on my bucket list.\u201d To realize that I had stumbled into fulfilling a dream of hers filled me with emotion. I held her hand and she smiled at me, in perfect understanding.         \n\nAnd yet she never told me about her heart attack, for four days.         \n\nAs I drove through the mountains of Pennsylvania, my anger grew. A call to my mother now found her resting at home.         \n\n\u201cAre you still upset?\u201d she asked quietly.         \n\n\u201cNow why would I be upset?\u201d I replied, sarcastically. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk soon.\u201d I hung up. She did not feel the need to inform me about her heart attack; I did feel the need to inform her that I was a half-hour from her doorstep.         \n\nWhen I walked inside, I found her dressed in a worn pink robe, pale with dark circles under her eyes, the television blaring. She looked small and alone. My anger melted. When she saw me, she said my name, covered her eyes and cried. I sat down and held her.         \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the best present you could ever give me.\u201d         \n\nThe mystery of it all, to be wanted and yet not summoned, was something I could not understand. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to bother you,\u201d she said.         \n\nBy the end of the week she was feeling better, and we were able to attend a lunch at the home of her friend Anne, along with Virginia. I watched the casual camaraderie among the three of them, all in their 80s.         \n\n\u201cSusie\u2019s husband told me they have fixed up their home so that I can go live there any time I want,\u201d said Anne, a mother of five. \u201cNow why would I want to do that?\u201d         \n\nVirginia and my mother smiled and nodded.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what they all want,\u201d my mother said, and for a moment it was as though I was not in the room, and they could speak openly.         \n\nI saw that these women, these friends, who had all buried husbands, all shared the same goal: to remain in their homes, independent and free. It occurred to me that it may have been more fitting for my mother to call these women first during her heart attack, perhaps more important than calling me. They understood her. They were her.         \n\nI took my mother\u2019s hand across the table, and she smiled at me, in perfect understanding.
