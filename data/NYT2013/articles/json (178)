{"headline": "Tonight\u2019s Honored Guest on the Mound, a Backflipping Frog", "body": "\nShortly before a recent game at Citi Field, four dancers in skin-tight, metallic green body suits slunk toward the pitcher\u2019s mound, where a man wearing a red tuxedo and top hat stood waiting.         \n\nAfter some nimble gesticulation, one of the creatures emerged from a squat, pulled a baseball from the man\u2019s top hat, turned a quick cartwheel and looped the ball toward home plate, where a backup catcher for the Mets was crouched.         \n\nIn a sport that clings to its traditions \u2014 from managers wearing uniforms to the playing of \u201cTake Me Out to the Ball Game\u201d during the seventh-inning stretch \u2014 one time-honored feature at the ballpark has taken an absurd turn, at least for the game\u2019s purists: the ceremonial first pitch.         \n\nFor decades, the honor was extended only a few times a season to a rarefied group that included presidents, mayors and military veterans. These days, it is regarded as a marketing opportunity, a sweetener in sponsorship deals between baseball teams and groups that want a piece of the spotlight.         \n\nThe rite, now carried out nightly, is handed to actors and reality television stars, sponsors\u2019 representatives and contest winners, and people dressed as animals as well as actual animals.         \n\nA capuchin monkey carried the ball out for a San Diego Padres game in September. Twice in the last two seasons, the Los Angeles Dodgers have welcomed to the mound Hello Kitty, or, rather, a person dressed as Hello Kitty.         \n\nSometimes, there are ceremonial second, third, fourth and fifth pitches. The day after making his major league debut this month, John Gast, a promising pitcher for the St. Louis Cardinals, crouched up and down to catch five pitches. The honorees that day were Edward Jones, a financial planning company; the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency; the Washington University School of Medicine; a local radio station; and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.         \n\n\u201cThe ceremonial first pitch summons echoes of baseball as the American game, the game of civic consciousness, local identity and body-politic attachment,\u201d said John Thorn, the official historian for Major League Baseball. \u201cOnce you get away from politicians and leaders and national heroes, and you get down to not even local heroes, but the guy who sold the most cars off the Dodge lot, the proposition gets devalued.\u201d         \n\nThe reptilian characters at Citi Field that afternoon were performers from the Cirque du Soleil show \u201cTotem,\u201d which was finishing a run on the grounds outside the stadium. Performers dressed as Julius Caesar and Cleopatra \u2014 gold-plated armor for him, a towering feathered crown for her \u2014 created a similar spectacle at the stadium last year.         \n\nThe Mets are hardly unique. Last year, Bear Grylls, the adventurer and star of the TV show \u201cMan vs. Wild,\u201d stepped onto the Dodger Stadium mound and set a baseball on fire before tossing it to the plate.         \n\nAround baseball, observers disagree on whether this evolution warrants outrage. But few dispute that the exclusivity of the ceremony has mostly disappeared.         \n\nWilliam Howard Taft is thought to have been the first president to take part in the pregame ritual when he tossed a ball from the stands at Griffith Stadium in Washington at the start of the 1910 season. John Fitzgerald, a Boston mayor known as Honey Fitz, who was John F. Kennedy\u2019s grandfather, threw one before the first official game at Fenway Park in 1912. Gov. Al Smith of New York threw a first pitch to commemorate the opening of the old Yankee Stadium in 1923.         \n\nAll honorees back then threw the baseball from the stands, and no demarcation point is clear for when the ceremony moved to the pitcher\u2019s mound. Rather, it appears to have migrated gradually around the late 1970s and early 1980s.         \n\nWhenever it happened, the throw\u2019s shift to the field most likely set the stage for the evolution toward the current spectacle, and traditionalists bemoan the change. Peter Morris, a baseball historian, noted that the potential for embarrassment was 10 times as great from the mound, and others concurred.
