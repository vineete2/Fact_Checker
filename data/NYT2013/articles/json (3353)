{"headline": "Beyond the Pale as Well as the Els", "body": "\nThe elite residents of the Upper East Side from Fifth Avenue to Park generally balked once they got to Third Avenue, the elevated train forming a last barrier between the gentry and the working class. But a few visionaries breached that Chinese wall, including the developers of 333 East 68th, who braved the forbidden zone, adding white-gloved doormen in among the tenements.         \n\nBy the 1920s, few East Side blocks were vacant, the exceptions including that now occupied by  \n and the old Julia Richman High School, from First Avenue to Second, between 67th and 68th. Henry Sloane Coffin, the pastor of the influential Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church, had been among those who in 1912 urged the city to acquire most of the block for the park.         \n\nIn 1927, The New York Evening Post announced a \u201cNew \u2018Far East\u2019 Project,\u201d an asymmetrical 9- and 15-story co-op to be built at 333 East 68th, beyond both the Third and Second Avenue Els. Several factors favored this decision.         \n\nFirst, the land backed up to the rear yards of some old brownstones on 69th Street, not to tenements. Second, several 19th-century  \n on 68th Street, from Third to Second, had been renovated. Third, the land for No. 333 goes back 123 feet, instead of the usual 100 feet \u2014 the typical block measures 200 feet from north to south. Fourth, zoning allowed the portion of the lot across from the park to carry the taller 15-story section.         \n\nBecause of this, only 57 percent of the plot was covered, whereas the usual footprint runs to 70 percent or more. With the park and the low school on the south side, the row-house backyards on the north side, and the pinwheel-like design of the building, the apartments have multiple exposures and, often, cross-ventilation.         \n\nInstead of the usual scorched-earth concrete backyard, the developers planted extensive gardens along the rear. In a city of housing compromises, the result is remarkably sensitive and humane. For light and air, No. 333 is reminiscent of  \n, designed a year before, with light all around from its East River site. Like No. 333, the Sutton Place building is a rich red-brick Georgian with limestone trim, poised and suave.         \n\nAnd who was this unusual developer? The officer listed on the building permit is Frank D. Rogers, who worked on other projects; he was Walter Chrysler\u2019s principal assistant on the  \n, at 42nd and Lexington. But he seems to have been an owner\u2019s representative.         \n\nHowever, the land was bought in April 1927 by William Sloane Coffin, and he simultaneously sold to the 333 East 68th Corporation. Henry Sloane Coffin\u2019s brother and an executive in the family furniture firm W. & J. Sloane, Mr. Coffin was not known as a real estate developer, but he was active in limited-income projects, like MacDougal-Sullivan Gardens, south of Bleecker Street. And he was an original buyer of a top-floor duplex. Both facts suggest a close association with the building.         \n\nThe question of the designer is also complicated. The plans were filed by Van Wart and Wein, who had already designed the medieval Campanile, at the foot of 52nd and the East River. But press accounts, and a beautiful color rendering of the lobby, identify Cross & Cross as \u201csupervising architect,\u201d a title usually reserved for an architect who just reviews plans.         \n\nEliot and John Cross were also the architects of 1 Sutton Place South, and Anne Walker, who is working on a book on the firm with the architect Peter Pennoyer, says that William Sloane Coffin and John Cross were in the same class at Yale, and fellow members of Skull and Bones. The Cross Brothers may have done much more than supervise.         \n\nMarcia Davenport, writing as \u201cPenthouse\u201d in her column in The New Yorker, wrote in 1928 that No. 333 was \u201cunbelievably sunny and had been built \u201cwith full realization that buyers are likely to be much snootier than renters, and much more demanding.\u201d         \n\nAdvertisements from 1928 and 1929 described No. 333 as \u201ca building of Park Avenue quality,\u201d but \u201cat about one-half Park Avenue prices,\u201d and offered four-room co-op apartments for $10,000, with a maintenance fee of $98 per month. A six-room  \n was $27,500, with a monthly maintenance fee of $270.         \n\nThe residents were an interesting mix of society and talent. The portrait photographer Toni Frissell lived there early in her career, along with Frank Crowninshield, the editor of Vanity Fair for two decades. William Sloane Coffin Jr., later an influential clergyman and peace activist, lived there with his parents as a boy.         \n\nIn 1929, the developer Albert Mayer hired George and Edward Blum to design the apartment house next door, at the Second Avenue corner, also with a luscious, deep front garden.         \n\nIt is agreeable, but not so inventive as the Blums\u2019 contemporaneous 210 East 68th, and its Art Deco is more Central Park West than Park Avenue.         \n\nThe shareholders at 333 East 68th have allowed ivy to grow to astonishing heights, certainly more than a hundred feet, over their brick and limestone facade. Now it\u2019s fully leafed out, and at least four windows are completely screened by greenery. Don\u2019t they worry that the ivy could destroy brick and eat away mortar?         \n\n\u201cCertainly not,\u201d says Roger Pasquier, a member of the garden committee who has an apartment with three exposures and has never seen a lick of damage. \u201cI love the ivy. Everyone thinks it defines our building.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/19/realestate/a-co-op-beyond-the-pale-as-well-as-the-els.html", "date": "2013-05-16", "description": "When it was built in 1928, 333 East 68th Street, between First and Second Avenues, was considered too far east."}
