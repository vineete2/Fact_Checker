{"headline": "Mexico\u2019s Pride, Oil, May Be Opened to Outsiders", "body": "\nCIUDAD DEL CARMEN, Mexico \u2014 Every gas station in Mexico is stamped with the green-and-white logo of the state-owned oil monopoly, the economic lifeblood of the government. Oil Expropriation Day, commemorating the day Mexico seized control of the industry from foreign companies in 1938, is celebrated with speeches and even parades in some towns. An old song, \u201cThe Oil Worker Hymn,\u201d credits oil with \u201csaving our fatherland.\u201d         \n\nBut now, in what could be the biggest economic change in two decades, President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto is on the verge of rewriting the Constitution to open Mexico\u2019s oil, gas and electricity industry to private investment \u2014 a provocative move expected to lure international oil companies and expand North America\u2019s energy supply while testing the grip oil has on Mexico\u2019s soul.         \n\n\u201cWe must defend our oil,\u201d Cuauht\u00e9moc C\u00e1rdenas, a three-time presidential candidate and son of the president who nationalized the oil industry, declared in a television advertisement. The state oil company, he said, belongs \u201cto all Mexicans, and we must not allow it to go private.\u201d         \n\nThe legislation, which won final congressional approval on Thursday afternoon, declares that Mexico still owns its oil. But it allows private businesses to drill for oil and natural gas in partnership with the state monopoly, called Pemex, or on their own, returning international oil companies to territory they were kicked out of 75 years ago.         \n\n\u201cThey have been waiting for a long time for a true opportunity,\u201d Jeremy M. Martin, director of the energy program at the Institute of the Americas, said of the oil companies.         \n\nIn a country where oil is often equated with sovereignty and national pride, the plan has set off furious debate. But while demonstrations helped thwart a more tepid attempt to open the industry in 2008, they were not effective this time \u2014 though there were some colorful moments.         \n\nAs the lower chamber of the legislature argued over the change, one leftist lawmaker stripped down to his black underwear to suggest that the country was giving away its most treasured resources. The change must be ratified by just over half of Mexico\u2019s states in order to become law. Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s party controls a majority of the states.         \n\nThe goal, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s aides say, is to stimulate Mexico\u2019s sliding oil production and vault the country into the developed world by tapping vast pockets of oil and natural gas deep under the earth and sea. Foreign oil companies have quietly lobbied the government to open up for years. Pemex, short for Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos, is known for inefficiency at best and corruption at worst.         \n\nThe energy overhaul is the centerpiece of a series of changes Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto has pushed through this year with mixed results, including an effort to break up telecommunications monopolies, raise taxes and weaken the teachers union\u2019s hold on faltering schools. His Institutional Revolutionary Party \u2014 which nationalized the oil industry in the first place, setting Mexico on its course toward industrialization \u2014 joined with conservatives who have long wanted the changes, casting off a weakened left.         \n\nOpinion polls suggest that Mexicans are growing impatient with Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s agenda and do not feel the benefits, as economic growth has slowed and the violence he promised to tackle persists largely unchecked.         \n\nMr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto is banking that the energy changes will inject new life into the economy. Other presidents have failed in taking on the oil monopoly, a lifeblood to government coffers and a touchstone for the left.         \n\n\u201cOil has symbolic power in Mexico that it does not have in every oil country,\u201d said Noel Maurer, a political economist at Harvard Business School. \u201cMexico has built up national mythologies that \u2018the oil is ours.\u2019 It\u2019s like a flag-burning issue.\u201d         \n\nPolls show that a majority of Mexicans generally oppose foreign investment in oil, but the passions may be fading. While schoolchildren are still taught about the nationalization of the industry, it is covered in just one page in the standard fifth-grade history textbook.
