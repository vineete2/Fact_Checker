{"headline": "The Bedside Battleground", "body": "\nConsider the bedside table, a modest domestic surface that nonetheless offers as concise a portrait of human aspirations, anxieties and appetites as one could hope for in 2013. It\u2019s a mess.         \n\nLook at the tangle of electronics and other items, for example, that hums next to the head of David Rose, 46, a visiting scientist at the M.I.T. Media Lab, as he sleeps \u2014 or, more often, doesn\u2019t. Mr. Rose, the inventor of what is known as \u201cglanceable technology,\u201d which embeds digital interfaces in objects like light bulbs and cabinetry, has a Zeo sleep monitor; a Philips Sleep light (it dims as he gets ready for shut-eye); a cordless phone; an iPhone; a Bose speaker dock that his wife uses as her phone charger; a wristwatch; and a few paperbacks. It\u2019s all jammed onto the 18-by-24-inch landscapes of a pair of Ikea night stands that he and his wife have had for decades.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing,\u201d Mr. Rose said parenthetically, \u201cto still be in this 20-year transition from Ikea.\u201d         \n\nBut it\u2019s the gear atop the night stand, and the attendant tangle, that is the real issue. Or, as Alexa Hampton, president of Mark Hampton, the interior design firm, said recently, the collision of \u201celectronica and nostalgia\u201d that occurs nightly on the bedside table is a challenge. Ms. Hampton keeps photographs of her husband and children there, along with her iPad, her iPad Mini and her BlackBerry (which serves as her alarm clock), each with its own charger, as well as a riot of cosmetic equipment like tweezers, cuticle clippers and a magnifying mirror. All that, plus her eyeglasses and a stack of books, sits in a jumble on a silver tray.         \n\n\u201cYou can see it\u2019s not simply a problem of technology,\u201d Ms. Hampton said.         \n\nBut in the last half-decade, it is the addition of new technologies that has roiled this already crowded space. And designers and manufacturers are puzzling over how to mediate the mess.         \n\nRobin Standefer, the movie-set-designer-turned-architectural-designer who has been reinventing hotels and domestic interiors from here to Argentina with her husband, Stephen Alesch, offered an analogy. \u201cIt\u2019s like that new airplane,\u201d she said, referring to the Boeing  \n. \u201cIt has all these electronics, all these functions, and it\u2019s getting bigger and bigger. I have a complicated relationship with the bedside table. I want it to be something that\u2019s somewhat serene. I want to look up from the pillow and not see a display from Radio Shack.\u201d         \n\nSleep surveys confirm the digital invasion of the bedroom. In the most recent study by the National Sleep Foundation, a nonprofit group devoted to \u201csleep health,\u201d conducted in 2011, 72 percent of respondents reported that they take their phone to bed with them; 49 percent said they take a computer or tablet; and 13 percent, an e-reader. In 2010, a Pew Research poll found that 90 percent of those between 18 and 29 slept with their cellphones next to the bed.         \n\nAnd it appears these devices are augmenting all sorts of bedroom behaviors. In this month\u2019s GQ magazine, for instance, in a decorating feature about the bedroom, readers are cautioned not to check their smartphones after sex. \u201cWe know that looking at your phone is the new smoking after sex,\u201d reads the caption, \u201cbut at least wait until she leaves the room.\u201d         \n\nDecorators struggle with order in this area in part because they prefer to flank a bed with drawer-free tables (Celerie Kemble, a Manhattan designer, said, \u201cI like bistro tables, cabriole tables, even outdoor furniture\u201d) instead of actual night stands.         \n\nMs. Standefer put it this way: \u201cI want to see legs, not something boxy.\u201d         \n\nBut that affinity, Ms. Kemble said, \u201cleaves the conundrum of how do you hide the electronics? The iPad and the Kindle, most clients have both. And the iPhone and the BlackBerry. Don\u2019t forget the Invisalign, the night-grinding guards, the sleep apnea masks and the birth control. You have to have the conversation about birth control before you shop for the table. Single guys have to have some place to put the condoms. And what about the meds, the Ambien and the Viagra? Or earplugs? And for late-night worries, you need a place to put a pad of paper and a pen.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/14/garden/the-battleground-on-the-bedside-table.html", "date": "2013-03-13", "description": "The increasing popularity of electronics and unmentionables is challenging the modern night stand."}
