{"headline": "Pinot Noir and Duck: A Match Made in Heaven", "body": "\nLet\u2019s not mince words: the conventional and excellent pairing for duck is pinot noir. It\u2019s a beautiful combination that tends to work with many different accents and flavorings.         \n\nFor the sweet, faintly Asian glaze, a Vosne-Roman\u00e9e would echo the spice flavors. Other Burgundies would shine, too, as would well-balanced pinot noirs from Oregon, California, New Zealand and Germany. But while pinot noir is the orthodox choice, it\u2019s not nearly the only one. A good Bandol, with enough age to emerge from its brutally tannic youth, would be a delight. So would many of the new wave California mourv\u00e8dres. Consider Barolo, not too young but not too old. A cru Beaujolais, of course. Even Long Island merlot. For wine, duck is a delicious foil. It\u2019s hard to go wrong.\u00a0        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/18/dining/pinot-noir-and-duck-a-match-made-in-heaven.html", "date": "2013-12-17", "description": "It\u2019s hard to go wrong when choosing a wine to drink with this bird."}
