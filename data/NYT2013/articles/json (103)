{"headline": "Jason Isbell, Unloaded", "body": "\nIf you want to know how to cure a hangover, ask a musician, especially one who has recently been in rehab. \u201cPedialyte, that\u2019s what you need,\u201d Jason Isbell told me. He was standing outside a recording studio in suburban Nashville, lighting a cigarette. \u201cIt\u2019s the stuff you give kids who are dehydrated from diarrhea. It\u2019s like 10 Gatorades in one bottle.\u201d         \n\nIsbell is big and gregarious \u2014 he\u2019s 6-1, 200 pounds \u2014 with wary, deep-set blue eyes that flash and size you up at the same time. On this early afternoon in February, those eyes were puffy and red-rimmed. He had only three days to finish \u201cSoutheastern,\u201d his new album. He had four days until his wedding. Like Ray Liotta in the third act of \u201cGoodfellas,\u201d he was manic and barely sleeping. \u201cCoffee and adrenaline,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll see me through.\u201d         \n\nIn the old days, this kind of stress would have sent Isbell, who is 34, into a tailspin. He found fame early and wasn\u2019t ready for it. When he was 22, he joined the Drive-By Truckers, the brilliant and hard-living Alabama band. He quickly wrote several of the group\u2019s signature songs, including the title cut of its 2003 album, \u201cDecoration Day,\u201d and a beautiful bummer of a tune called \u201cGoddamn Lonely Love.\u201d He almost as quickly burned out.         \n\nHis first marriage, to Shonna Tucker, the band\u2019s bassist at the time, came unstitched in public. There were some ugly scenes. Isbell\u2019s fondness for Jack Daniel\u2019s did not become him. \u201cSome people get drunk and become kind of sweet,\u201d Patterson Hood, one of the Drive-By Truckers\u2019 principal singer-songwriters, told me. \u201cJason wasn\u2019t one of those people.\u201d Isbell left the band in 2007.         \n\nWhat followed was an unhappy period of wandering. He made a few mediocre solo records. He became bloated from drinking. Everyone who followed his work with the Truckers knew he was one of America\u2019s thoroughbred songwriters, with a knack for rueful melodies and the kind of grainy blue-collar detail that pins a song in your mind, like the character in \u201cOutfit\u201d who winds up back in \u201ctech school/just to memorize Frigidaire parts.\u201d But he\u2019d lost his way.         \n\nHis resurrection began when his single, \u201cAlabama Pines,\u201d won Song of the Year at the 2012 Americana Awards, which honor the kind of rebellious and pared-down roots music that used to be called alternative country. \u201cAlabama Pines\u201d is pure Isbell: elegiac and self-lacerating. \u201cI can\u2019t get to sleep at night, the parking lot\u2019s so loud and bright,\u201d the song\u2019s narrator intones from a motel room. \u201cThe a/c hasn\u2019t worked in 20 years/Probably never made a single person cold/but I can\u2019t say the same for me, I\u2019ve done it many times.\u201d         \n\nBut his real comeback wasn\u2019t possible until February 2012, when his girlfriend (now wife), the singer and songwriter Amanda Shires, with the help of his manager Traci Thomas and the musician Ryan Adams, got him into rehab. Isbell spent two weeks in Cumberland Heights, an alcohol-and-drug-treatment center in Nashville. His head cleared. When he came out, the whiskey weight drained from his cells, and he shed 40 pounds almost overnight. Best of all, that summer he began writing the songs that make up \u201cSoutheastern.\u201d The record, which evokes powerful and intimate classics like Bruce Springsteen\u2019s \u201cTunnel of Love\u201d and Rosanne Cash\u2019s \u201cInteriors,\u201d is a breakthrough for Isbell \u2014 prickly with loss, forgiveness, newfound sobriety and second chances\u00ad.         \n\nStanding outside the studio, where he was working on a few final tracks, Isbell stubbed out a third cigarette. \u201cI\u2019m lucky to have a second chance at all this. I don\u2019t remember a lot of the good times from my days with the Truckers.\u201d This time around, no Pedialyte will be necessary. \u201cThis time I want to remember it all.\u201d         \n\n \n let\u2019s nail this thing,\u201d Dave Cobb whispered into a microphone. He\u2019s the young Nashville-based producer who was brought in to work on \u201cSoutheastern\u201d after Ryan Adams, with whom Isbell toured last year, dropped out of production duties at the last minute, rankling some in Isbell\u2019s camp. Cobb\u2019s backyard studio, like most recording studios, put me in mind of a casino and an artisanal cocktail bar at the same time: dark at midday, air-conditioned, absent of clocks, with banks of colored LED lights.
