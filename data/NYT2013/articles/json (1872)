But one revelation was particularly startling: Just a single woman among its top officials.         \n\nThe board? All white men. The investors? All men. The executive officers? All men but for the general counsel, Vijaya Gadde, who has had the job for five weeks.         \n\n\u201cThis is the elite arrogance of the Silicon Valley mafia, the Twitter mafia,\u201d said Vivek Wadhwa, a fellow at Stanford\u2019s Rock Center for Corporate Governance who is writing a book on women in tech. \u201cIt\u2019s the same male chauvinistic thinking. The fact that they went to the I.P.O. without a single woman on the board, how dare they?\u201d         \n\nEven as women make significant headway in fields from law to business, and technology zooms along as one of the fastest-growing sectors of the economy, its doors remain virtually closed to women. Just 5.7 percent of employed women in the United States work in the computer industry, and only about 2 percent of women have a degree in a high-tech field,  \n, a prominent research firm studying women and business.         \n\nAnd despite tech executives like Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook and Marissa Mayer of Yahoo, and  \n to attract women to the field \u2014 like  \n, a software engineering training program \u2014 Twitter\u2019s male-dominated cast shows how stubbornly difficult it has been for women to make their way to positions of power and influence in tech.         \n\nThe  \n. The tech industry has an image problem \u2014 think geeky man alone at a computer \u2014 that repels girls from pursuing it. A sexist engineering culture often dissuades young women in the field, as does the small number of women role models. Venture capital tends to be an  \n.         \n\nHaving women executives matters not just for purposes of equality, business analysts say, but for product development and the bottom line. More women use social media than men, according to  \n last month by the Pew Research Center; men and women use Twitter roughly equally. Twitter earns revenue from advertising and women are the chief consumers.         \n\nStudies have all found the same thing, according to groups who advise and advocate for women in tech, including  \n and the  \n: Diversity benefits research, development and innovation, the heartbeat of Silicon Valley. It also increases profit, something Twitter sorely needs.         \n\n\u201cPeople who build technology should represent the people who use it,\u201d reads one of the mottos of the National Center for Women and Information Technology,  \n.         \n\nYet women rarely fill the technical and engineering positions at Silicon Valley companies, which carry the most prestige and are most likely to lead to corner offices. Tellingly, Ms. Gadde, the only woman of high enough rank to appear on the public offering filing, is a lawyer, not an engineer \u2014 and until Aug. 30, her position was held by a man, Alex Macgillivray, who unexpectedly resigned.         \n\nTwitter has several women vice presidents in business, not technical, roles: Katie Jacobs Stanton in international market development, Chloe Sladden in media, Janet VanHuysse in human resources and Jana Messerschmidt in business development.         \n\nTwitter by no means stands out in Silicon Valley as being particularly unwelcoming to women. It spends money and time on initiatives like Girls Who Code, where its chief technology officer, Adam Messinger, is on the board. Still, Twitter\u2019s entire staff reflects the gender imbalance at the highest levels. Significantly less than half of its engineers are women.         \n\nTwitter declined to comment on the issue Friday. But in an interview in March, Mr. Messinger said hiring more women engineers was a priority.         \n\n\u201cHalf our customers, more or less, are women, and we want to have empathy for our customers, and part of that is having a wide variety of opinions in-house,\u201d Mr. Messinger said. \u201cIt\u2019s also something a lot of people here think is the right thing to do.\u201d         \n\nBut, he added, \u201cThere is definitely a supply-side problem.\u201d         \n\nDick Costolo, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, has prioritized finding a woman to be on the board, but has found it difficult, according to two people with knowledge of his plans who were not authorized to speak about them publicly.         \n\n\u201cEveryone is trying for diversity, both gender and ethnic diversity, on boards and in operating positions,\u201d said Rick Devine, chief executive of TalentSky, a Silicon Valley recruiting firm. \u201cThe issue isn\u2019t the intention, the issue is just the paucity of candidates.\u201d         \n\nBut some people in the tech industry rolled their eyes at the pipeline excuse.         \n\n\u201cHere is the thing about these companies: When something is a priority, they move fast and break things,\u201d said Rachel Sklar, co-founder of TheLi.st, a digital media company for women in business. \u201cIn a year they knew they were going to go public, knowing this was an issue, in the era of \u2018Lean In,\u2019 it was not a priority.\u201d         \n\nEven if the pool for board-qualified women in technology is shallow, Twitter\u2019s business overlaps with other industries like media, entertainment and advertising. Its most recently appointed director, for instance, was Peter Chernin, former president of News Corporation.         \n\nAcross Silicon Valley, start-ups tend to have all-male boards, largely because board members are the venture capitalists who invested in the company, 89 percent of whom are men,  \n the National Venture Capital Association.         \n\nIt is often when tech companies first face the pressures and demands of being a public company that they recruit women to their boards. Facebook and Zynga, for instance, added their first women directors after going public.         \n\nNot that the public companies fare much better. Ms. Sandberg; Ms. Mayer; Virginia M. Rometty, I.B.M.\u2019s chief; and Meg Whitman, Hewlett-Packard\u2019s chief, are exceptions to the rule. At Google, which made a point of hiring and promoting women when it started, the percentage of women in senior positions  \n in the last several years.         \n\nThe rate at which women leave the tech industry is double the rate of men, according to \u201c \n,\u201d a report released last week by the Anita Borg Institute. The reasons include lack of promotions, time away from their families and aversion to company cultures.         \n\nWomen tend not to join start-ups during the high-growth, pre-public offering period, often because the workplace environment is unwelcoming or they perceive it to be that way, said Poornima Vijayashanker, founder of Femgineer, which advises women on careers in tech, and the first woman engineer at Mint, the finance start-up acquired by Intuit. Then, when they do join, they often pursue roles in product management or customer support, even though hard-core engineering or finance roles are more likely to lead to top positions.         \n\n\u201cWomen need to become more technical,\u201d Ms. Vijayashanker said. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to just learn how to code. They have to really cultivate their technical careers.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/05/technology/as-tech-start-ups-surge-ahead-women-seem-to-be-left-behind.html", "date": "2013-10-04", "description": "Even as women make headway in fields like law and business, and technology zooms along as one of the fastest-growing sectors of the economy, its doors remain virtually closed to women."}
