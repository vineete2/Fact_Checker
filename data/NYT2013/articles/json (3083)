{"headline": "The Cool Side of Campy Frozen Drinks", "body": "\nThe frozen daiquiri, the pi\u00f1a colada, the frozen margarita: these drinks remind me of a certain kind of great-aunt \u2014 the one who has worn the same coral lipstick since 1959, the one whose laughter is like a wheezy rush of air, the one in the paisley caftan who had an affair with a famous bandleader back in the day. Some relatives might have cringed at the very thought of her. Others, like me, wanted to hang out with her all the time \u2014 and maybe even grow up to be her.         \n\nMost of all, these drinks remind us that drinking ought to be fun and that, to quote Diana Vreeland, a little bad taste is hearty and healthy. In the summer, I long for these drinks and their garnishes, colorful straws and paper umbrellas. This is surely why, after my air-conditioner, my second-most-cherished appliance during last month\u2019s heat wave was my blender.         \n\nI wouldn\u2019t say they are adequate meal substitutes, but without alcohol, these drinks are essentially \u2014 and I brace myself for the most revolting word in the English language \u2014 \u201csmoothies.\u201d But part of what makes them perfect for the most brutal of days is that you can liquor them up or down as much as you like.         \n\nPurists might blanch at my recipes (each of which yields two servings). After all,  \n isn\u2019t the first thing that comes to mind when Mexican food aficionados think of margaritas. Hemingway is not very likely to have taken his daiquiri with  \n. (The traditional pi\u00f1a colada recipe, despite some debate over its provenance,  \n.) But I can\u2019t resist the charms of these frozen wonders, especially since they lend themselves to endless improvising: if you don\u2019t love blackberries, substitute your favorite berry in the frozen margarita. I tend to like drinks on the tart side, but you can adjust the lime juice or add simple syrup to sweeten things up. As I learned when I tested these recipes, not all blenders crush ice with equal gusto, so add more ice, and blend longer, to achieve the degree of slushiness you want. Just don\u2019t drink too fast; brain freeze! And that could spoil all the fun.
