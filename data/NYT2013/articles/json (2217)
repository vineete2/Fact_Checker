{"headline": "General Selected for NATO Post Will Retire, Citing Wife\u2019s Health", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Gen.  \n, the four-star Marine Corps officer who served until earlier this month as the top commander in Afghanistan, will retire from the military to focus on \u201chealth issues within his family,\u201d President Obama said on Tuesday.         \n\nGeneral Allen was caught up in the scandal that led to the resignation of David H. Petraeus as the director of the Central Intelligence Agency. But last month, the Pentagon officially cleared him of misconduct after an investigation into his exchange of e-mails with Jill Kelley, a Tampa, Fla., woman who was also a friend of Mr. Petraeus\u2019s. General Allen had gotten to know her when he was in a leadership role at the Central Command in Tampa.         \n\nMr. Obama had nominated General Allen to be the supreme commander of  \n, but in the intervening weeks the general decided to retire.         \n\n\u201cI told General Allen that he has my deep, personal appreciation for his extraordinary service over the last 19 months in Afghanistan, as well as his decades of service in the United States Marine Corps,\u201d Mr. Obama said in a statement. \u201cJohn Allen is one of America\u2019s finest military leaders, a true patriot, and a man I have come to respect greatly.\u201d         \n\nAfter the announcement by Mr. Obama, General Allen released a statement through Pentagon officials saying that \u201cthe reasons for my decision are personal.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI did not come to it lightly or quickly, but given the considerations behind it, I recognized in the end it was the only choice I could make,\u201d the general said. \u201cWhile I won\u2019t go into the details, my primary concern is for the health of my wife, who has sacrificed so much for so long.\u201d         \n\nBut there is little doubt that an unexpected obstacle to General Allen\u2019s new assignment at NATO was the inquiry by the Pentagon inspector general.         \n\nGeneral Allen had strong support among members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and confirmation seemed certain. Even so, officials noted that during a confirmation process, a senator could have officially requested the e-mails between General Allen and Ms. Kelley, and that they might have become public.         \n\nLeon E. Panetta, the departing defense secretary, described General Allen on Tuesday as \u201cone of the United States military\u2019s most outstanding battlefield leaders, a brilliant strategist and an exemplary Marine, and I am deeply grateful for his many years of dedicated service to our country.\u201d         \n\nMr. Panetta added that \u201cGeneral Allen\u2019s selfless dedication to our troops and to their mission was a source of inspiration to those who served with him, as well as to those of us here at home.\u201d         \n\nMr. Panetta disclosed last week that he had met with General Allen and had urged him to take some time off with his family before deciding whether to accept the president\u2019s nomination and oversee both American and allied forces in Europe.         \n\nGeneral Allen, 59, has \u201cbeen under a tremendous amount of pressure, a lot of challenges,\u201d Mr. Panetta said, citing the demands of commanding a complex counterinsurgency effort, as well as the effort to compose recommendations to Mr. Obama on reducing troop levels in Afghanistan. Pentagon officials said that General Allen\u2019s wife, Kathy, has been battling long-term health problems, including an autoimmune issue, and that another overseas move, to Belgium for the NATO job, would have been extremely difficult.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m where I need to be right now, at home with my family,\u201d General Allen said in an e-mail on Tuesday night. \u201cGiven the circumstances, while the decision seems big, it wasn\u2019t difficult.\u201d         \n\nOfficials noted that General Allen has not served a full three years in a four-star position, and thus would require a presidential waiver to retire with full benefits earned by that rank.         \n\nGen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr. succeeded General Allen as the commander of American and international military forces in Afghanistan in a ceremony in Kabul on Feb. 10. The president\u2019s statement did not say who would be nominated to be the supreme NATO commander, a post now held by Adm. James G. Stavridis, who is set to retire this spring after a career that included leading the military\u2019s Southern Command.         \n\nTraditionally, the top NATO military job has gone to an officer with one or two tours as a four-star officer, and often with experience in the region.         \n\nPotential nominees could include Gen. Philip M. Breedlove, the commander of United States Air Force units in Europe and Africa; Adm. Bruce W. Clingan, the commander of Navy forces in Europe and Africa; Adm. Mark Ferguson, the vice chief of naval operations; Gen. William M. Fraser III of the Air Force, currently in charge at the Transportation Command; and Adm. James A. Winnefeld Jr., the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
