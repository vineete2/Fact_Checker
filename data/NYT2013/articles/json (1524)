But should you get transferred to Paris, you will probably eat like the French: multicourse sit-down lunches plus a glass of wine.         \n\nBut it turns out people are not the only ones who make monkey-see-monkey-do cultural shifts. Monkeys, and apparently several other species, do, too.         \n\nIn a clever, groundbreaking study  \n Thursday in the journal Science, researchers showed that when Vervet monkeys roam, they act in when-in-Rome fashion.         \n\nWild Vervet monkeys, trained to eat only pink-dyed or blue-dyed corn and shun the other color, quickly began eating the disliked-color corn when they moved from a pink-preferred setting to a blue-is-best place, and vice versa.         \n\nThe switch occurred even though both corn colors were equally accessible, side-by-side in open containers. Scientists said the monkeys relinquished their color convictions because they saw the locals eating the hated hue.         \n\nThe findings addressed a long-contentious question among animal experts: is animal behavior determined only by genes and individual learning, or can animals, like humans, learn socially?         \n\n\u201cCulture was thought to be something only humans had,\u201d said Carel van Schaik, an evolutionary anthropologist at the University of Zurich who was not involved in the study. \u201cBut if you define culture as socially transmitted knowledge, skills and information, it turns out we see some of that in animals. Now this experiment comes along and I must say it really blew me away.\u201d         \n\nHe added: \u201cImagine you\u2019ve just learned to eat pink corn and for a while blue corn was really bad, but then you move to an area where it\u2019s the opposite and basically you wipe your slate clean. You think, \u2018Oh, these locals, they must know what\u2019s the best thing.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nOther studies have found similar learning abilities in social animals. In the same issue of Science, researchers reported that by observing others, humpback whales learned to whack the water with their tail fins to attract prey.         \n\nBut while previous research often relied on anecdotes, observations or animals in captivity, the monkey study documented social learning in wild animals.         \n\n\u201cWe long believed that cultural transmission was important,\u201d said Frans de Waal, a primatologist at Emory University who did not take part in the study. \u201cBut I never thought it would be at the scale where the results would be so strong.\u201d         \n\nThe scientists set out pink and blue corn in adjacent Tupperware containers for four groups of wild monkeys in neighboring regions in a South African reserve. A study leader, Erica van de Waal, a researcher at University of St. Andrews in Scotland, said she wanted to use red and blue, shades monkeys are known to see because they are the colors of male Vervet genitalia. But South African grocery stores stocked mostly blue and pink food coloring because people use them for cakes celebrating girl and boy birthdays.         \n\nAfter trying vinegar and chilies to make corn taste bitter, researchers settled on soaking corn in acrid-tasting aloe leaves. Pink corn was \u201caloe treated\u201d for two groups; blue for the other two. Soon, monkeys in each group consistently rejected the colored corn soaked in aloe leaves.         \n\nAfter several months, researchers stopped treating the corn with aloe, but monkeys continued eating only the color that had never been made bitter. Dominant monkeys never sampled the disliked color; subordinate monkeys might, but only if dominants were hogging the liked color.         \n\nBaby monkeys, which received no color training, instantly ate only what their mothers ate, even squatting on the other color, \u201ctotally ignoring that there was an edible color under their feet,\u201d Dr. van de Waal said.         \n\nMost strikingly, when male monkeys migrated from a different-colored region, they ate the local color. The one exception was a blue-is-best male who entered a pink area with no dominant male, took control and continued eating blue corn. But he \u201cmight be a stupid male that had too much testosterone and was just not looking at what the others are doing,\u201d Dr. van de Waal said.         \n\nShe said researchers hoped to test if social learning applied to other behaviors, like mating calls and grooming.         \n\nExperts said that to survive, species must balance experimentation with conservatism, so it makes sense that monkeys would develop rigid aversions to a once bitter-tasting color, and drop that aversion in another community. Both behaviors have advantages for survival, saving learning time and avoiding deadly risks.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t expect it in bacteria or slugs,\u201d Dr. van Schaik said. \u201cBut in these long-lived species that are social, you\u2019re actually willing to give up what you know, drop that memory like a hot potato, because those in the other place do something else.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/26/science/science-study-shows-monkeys-pick-up-social-cues.html", "date": "2013-04-25", "description": "A study published in Science showed that monkeys conditioned to eat a certain color corn switched to a disliked color when other monkeys were eating it."}
