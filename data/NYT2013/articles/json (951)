{"headline": "Having One for the Sky", "body": "\nA man at a bar orders a julep. The bartender nods and turns to grab a canvas satchel known as a Lewis bag. He fills it with ice, reaches for a wooden mallet and begins to pulverize the bag\u2019s contents, creating the crushed ice needed to build the cocktail.         \n\nSuch a sight isn\u2019t unusual these days, when mallets and Lewis bags are part of the everyday tool kit of the high-end mixologist. Except that this scene didn\u2019t unfold in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, or the Mission District of San Francisco or any other hotbed of cocktail innovation. It happened in Concourse E of the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport at a restaurant and bar called  \n.         \n\nWith rare exceptions, airports have never been places where Americans expect to secure anything above the adequate in terms of food or drink. But just as portals like Kennedy and La Guardia have asked big-name chefs and restaurateurs like Andrew Carmellini, Danny Meyer and Michael White to bring their culinary know-how to the runway, air hubs are now starting to take their drinking game beyond Budweiser, Bloody Marys and merlot.         \n\nSo as the holidays send Americans back into chaotic baggage-check lines and crowded security checkpoints, there is at least the possibility of an interesting drink to help soothe all the headaches.         \n\n\u201cWe saw a void in quality offerings for travelers, and we wanted to fill it,\u201d said Tiffanie Barrier\u00e9, the head bartender at One Flew South. \u201cExcellent food and cocktails bring a sense of elegance and comfort back to traveling. Who doesn\u2019t want that?\u201d         \n\nOne Flew South, where Duane Nutter is executive chef, was a pioneer, opening in 2008. Ice Dishes and Drinks, a bar equipped with five different kinds of ice and 24 kinds of vodka, opened last year at O\u2019Hare International Airport in Chicago. And last Labor Day weekend,  \n, a Denver restaurant, started a branch at Denver International Airport. The new location has 22 Colorado beers on tap and cocktails like the Starry Night (aged rum, absinthe, maple syrup, pineapple juice, lemon juice, cream and Angostura bitters, topped with a garnish of star anise).         \n\nAt La Guardia Airport,  \n (it runs more than\u00a0200 outlets in 10 airports), brought in Garrett Oliver, the brewmaster at  \n, to create serious beer menus at several of its restaurants, and Roger Dagorn, a well-regarded sommelier, to do the same for wine.         \n\nFor Michael Coury, OTG\u2019s head concept chef, an emphasis on local products was important. So Mr. Oliver\u2019s beer lists include brews from Brooklyn and the Bronx, and Mr. Dagorn\u2019s lineup embraces the Long Island and Finger Lakes wine-growing regions. \u201cI think travelers are looking for the same experience that they just had, either in their own city or the city they\u2019re visiting,\u201d Mr. Coury said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing that. It just happens to be in an airport.\u201d         \n\nMr. Oliver\u2019s stamp is most clearly seen at Biergarten, which opened in June in La Guardia\u2019s Terminal C, where Delta Air Lines and US Airways operate. The German-themed menu is complemented by a lengthy draft list that would rival those at most New York City craft-beer bars. Recent selections included Green Flash West Coast IPA from California and K\u00f6stritzer Schwarzbier from Germany.         \n\nMr. Dagorn\u2019s wine expertise is in full flower at Wibar, which opened in November. Customers there can choose from more than 100 wines by the glass; a third are from New York State. \u00a0         \n\nThere are also wine-bar chains that do business largely in airports, like  \n (29 locations in 20 airports, including Seattle and Detroit) and  \n (a chain started in France that has bars in Houston and Newark, with a Kennedy Airport branch opening in January). Le Grand Comptoir serves 50 wines by the glass, including sparkling and dessert wines, while Vino Volo has thematically linked wine flights, like pinot noirs from California, Oregon and New Zealand.         \n\n\u00a0And some airports have branded bars created in collaboration with specific distillers. One of the most recent and elaborate is the Unusual Times; affiliated with Hendrick\u2019s Gin, it opened last spring in Newark Liberty International Airport. Though gin takes center stage, the bar offers other spirits and trains its staff with a mixologist\u2019s attention to detail.         \n\nStill, the tightly controlled environment of an airport presents some challenges for high-quality bartenders. Certain liquor companies, for instance, aren\u2019t licensed to work with the Denver airport, so a big-brand spirit has sometimes had to be substituted for a preferred artisanal product. \u201cWe have to find the next-best things\u201d sometimes, said Justin Cucci, owner of the original Root Down. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think we made any compromises in quality.\u201d         \n\nBecause customers are on the go, speed is an issue. \u201cEveryone\u2019s got 20, 25 minutes at most,\u201d said Mike Henderson, the beverage director at Root Down. \u201cThey need to eat, drink, pay and get out. We built the list to make the drinks really fast.\u201d         \n\nOther adjustments are just common sense. \u201cNo flamed garnishes or fire,\u201d said Ms. Barrier\u00e9 of One Flew South.         \n\nThen again, some potential negatives can end up being pluses in disguise. \u201cInitially, I thought it was going to be tremendously hard to get good bartenders who want to work at an airport,\u201d Mr. Henderson said. But the bar\u2019s unwavering, more humane hours (7 a.m. to 10 p.m. every day) proved attractive to some staff members.         \n\nAlso, customer loyalty can become thrillingly clear to bartenders who work beyond security checkpoints. \u201cGuests will schedule long layovers to come see us,\u201d Ms. Barrier\u00e9 said. \u201cWe see this very frequently.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/11/dining/having-one-for-the-sky.html", "date": "2013-12-10", "description": "Airports in the United States are making quality cocktails and interesting beers easier to find."}
