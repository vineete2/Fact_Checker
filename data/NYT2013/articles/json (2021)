{"headline": "\u2018Speculation Is the New Spoiler\u2019", "body": "\nWARNING:  \n         \n\n\u201cHow great would it be if Walt was about to use the ricin and someone random blew his head off, and the show ended with a pull away from his dead body?\u201d         \n\nThus read the text of an email from Jeff, a lawyer friend of mine, sent five days before the \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d finale, which aired last month. Jeff is smart, and he loves the same TV shows that I love, which gives us a lot to talk about over the course of these fraught, intense TV seasons. But the interim-episode emails between Jeff and me can be treacherous; they are the Wild West of my inbox. There are no rules to these emails, save one: They can contain no spoilers \u2014 spoilers, of course, being plot points of a show shared by people who have heard what\u2019s going to happen in advance or have seen the show before you have.         \n\nJeff and I (and the other people randomly c.c.\u2019d on these emails, like his wife or my husband or a neighbor named David) are adamantly against spoilers. We would label any messages that even hint at previous or even day-after knowledge loudly in the subject line \u2014 we\u2019re not savages, after all.         \n\nBut our emails aren\u2019t made up of plot points and did-you-see-that?\u2019s. The content of these emails is primarily speculation. Jeff sees nothing wrong with a week spent guessing what might happen on the next episode.         \n\nThe only problem \u2014 and this realization peaked for me about five days before the \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d finale \u2014 is that lately I want nothing to do with those emails.         \n\n \n to do is to try to predict what might happen to any TV show as it comes to its season \u2014 or even better, series \u2014 finale. The fact that he\u2019s a lawyer is important, because it means that he\u2019s generally good at poking holes in theories and remembering hints and pieces of evidence I have long since forgotten. It\u2019s even more important to note that he\u2019s an entertainment lawyer here in Los Angeles, which means that when he suggests theories like this Walter White-ricin one outlined above, I have to concern myself with whether his email might have something to do with inside knowledge \u2014 the pop-culture equivalent of a seemingly random notion dropped casually by a stockbroker friend that might eventually lead to an insider-trading charge.         \n\n\u201cDo you know something?\u201d I typed in my reply to him, which may have been in capital letters. \u201cIf you do, and you just said it, I\u2019m never speaking to you again.\u201d         \n\n\u201cHow could I possibly?\u201d he answered. Later, he sent me a remarkably well thought out series of endgame scenarios. The Nazis win. Walt wins. Jesse wins. It was all a dream. A random car crash kills all the main characters \u2014 because sometimes that\u2019s just how life works.         \n\nSome of this speculation was wild guessing for the sake of wild guessing, and some of it was rooted in the hard evaluation of evidence: Why, for example, were Walt and Jesse pictured on the cover of Entertainment Weekly covered in blood and dirt? Clearly the series ends in a great cloud of blood! And dirt!         \n\nEither way, I open each of Jeff\u2019s emails with great hesitation. He\u2019s just doing what the rest of the Internet is doing: guessing publicly. A different friend sent me a blog post that examines a few possible outcomes. I immediately deleted it. Friends emailed me prediction after prediction from Entertainment Weekly articles, all of which were probably incredibly insightful. I trashed them all, unread. New York magazine\u2019s culture site, Vulture, seemed to be all \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d all the time. So I unfollowed it on both Twitter and Facebook.         \n\nAs we adjust to a new climate of TV \u2014 one in which each season of a popular show is dissected, in real time, in an incessant, ongoing conversation on the Internet \u2014 I realize my fresh predicament: I have been longing for this cultural moment, one in which my obsessive love for TV is vindicated. Yet now I find I can\u2019t escape these conversations quickly enough. The more adept I get at Twitter, the more of Jeff\u2019s emails I receive, the more Entertainment Weekly issues I pore over, the less I enjoy the actual show when it\u2019s actually on.         \n\nI can\u2019t deny how much fun it is to talk over a TV show, to think and overthink, and then overthink the overthinking. But anticipation of what  \n happen is now as fearsome to me as information about what  \n happen. Speculation is the new spoiler.
