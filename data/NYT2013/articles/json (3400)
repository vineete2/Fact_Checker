{"headline": "The Fear That Dare Not Speak Its Name", "body": "\nJasmine-n\u00e9e-Jeanette, the wilting flower at the center of Woody Allen\u2019s Age-of-Madoff fable, \u201cBlue Jasmine,\u201d is in extremis. Her husband\u2019s income once supported her, opulently. But now the money is gone, and so is the husband. Jasmine never finished college, and she has no practical ambitions or employable skills. The simplest principles of computer use confound her. She has lost her friends and alienated her family; her working-class sister, who has temporarily housed her, wants her gone. Jasmine is also losing her mind, the disintegration hastened by drink and pills. And in a bravura performance \u2014 all smudged eyes, pale sheen of flop sweat and nervous hand gestures of self-delusion \u2014 Cate Blanchett makes Jasmine a riveting spectacle of disintegration, last seen nattering to herself on a park bench. She\u2019s so bedraggled that the stranger on the bench next to her, smelling crazy in the air, picks up and leaves.         \n\nAt the end of \u201cA Streetcar Named Desire\u201d \u2014 on which \u201cBlue Jasmine\u201d is openly based \u2014 Blanche DuBois is carted off to an institution. But at the end of his updated take, Allen deposits Jasmine in financial and psychic limbo, offering no clue as to what her fate will be. No clue, that is, except to me, and to every woman of my (baby boomer) generation or older who can read the signs in a fibrillating heartbeat: Jasmine will become a bag lady.         \n\nShe will wander the streets \u2014 poor, homeless, alone, unable to earn a wage or survive on her own. She will be shunned as crazy even when she\u2019s not. She will become invisible. And she will be forgotten.         \n\nThis is a future so seriously awful that Allen doesn\u2019t dare show it on the screen. I mean, \u201cBlue Jasmine\u201d is tough, by the filmmaker\u2019s standards, on its protagonist. But the core audience would run howling from Lincoln Plaza Cinemas, unable even to enjoy a nice cruller or a flute of prosecco afterward, if he showed anything closer to the truth.         \n\nJasmine is my secret nightmare made flesh. I have no heights of luxury to fall from, no jewels to lose. But I do have the nice, self-sufficient little life that I have worked to put together for myself: the funds allocated for rent, for food, for clothes and tickets to Woody Allen movies and a little bit allocated for old age. What if I lost that security and with it my standing in the world? \u201cBlue Jasmine\u201d hit me hard and depressed me silly. There but for the grace of a Chanel jacket go I.         \n\n \n of so many women I know. We can intuit Jasmine\u2019s fate because ending up a bag lady is our darkest and clammiest fear. The possibility of falling into bag-ladydom is a terror so deep, so longstanding, so embarrassing to admit yet so matter of fact that we accept it as simply a part of being a woman. I joke with these friends \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t want to end up like one of those, ha ha\u201d \u2014 and they comprehend the confession behind the nervous laugh immediately. I also know that our shared dread has little to do with rationality and everything to do with what we understand about how we precariously bagless ladies get by in this world.         \n\nSome, like Jasmine, may count on the support of a husband or partner and are (or fear being) stranded if and when that support is taken away. Others, all the single ladies like me who have always been on our own, count on our ability to earn and save and earn and save enough to pay our own way in life, now and into our (knock-wood) long-lived, old-lady futures. Even before the real wreckage caused by Bernie Madoff (and echoed in the fictional malfeasance of Jasmine\u2019s husband), I have been awakened by the creepy whisper: What if my savings vanished? What if I couldn\u2019t drum up work, pay my bills, keep the wheels of my life rolling? Who will care about me?         \n\nThe power of this vision of future destitution lies in its ability to penetrate the armor of logic and prudent planning and, along the way, to undermine the gains of second-wave feminism too. Before us, women were raised to expect protection from a man \u2014 a husband, specifically \u2014 in exchange for a traditional trade-off in options: His paycheck, her casseroles. And as a result, older divorced women are particularly susceptible to these terrors, even outstandingly successful and to all appearances financially secure older divorced women. Here\u2019s the statistical proof: In March, a 2013 survey on women, money and power, issued by the Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America, made headlines with its findings that nearly half of all American women fear becoming bag ladies \u2014 yes, the survey actually used that phrase \u2014 including 27 percent with household earnings of more than $200,000 a year. (And the worry is widespread: 56 percent among single women, 54 percent divorced, 47 percent widowed and 43 percent married.)
