{"headline": "Mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2019s Companion, Diana Taylor, Gives a Rare Interview", "body": "\nGreeting a visitor to her office at Wolfensohn Fund Management earlier this month,  \n betrayed a touch of jitters. \u201cWould you like something to drink,\u201d she asked twice in quick succession, before catching herself, and murmuring distractedly, \u201cOh, I asked you that.\u201d         \n\nSo it was impressive to watch her nimbly shift gears for the photo shoot that followed, dashing off to freshen her lipstick before facing the camera with a ready smile, her arms crossed, the picture of poise.         \n\nIt was another seamless transition for Ms. Taylor, who in more than a dozen years as Mayor  \n\u2019s quietly glamorous sidekick has had plenty of time to adapt to the spotlight. Yet even now, as she winds down her tenure as the de facto first lady of New York City \u2014 a period during which she raised her political and social profile and redefined the notion of a trophy date \u2014 Ms. Taylor remains an object of avid speculation.         \n\nAs the first couple prepares to leave office, questions arise: Which direction will Ms. Taylor pursue in a multifaceted career in which she has jumped from aide to Gov. George E. Pataki, to superintendent of banking for the State of New York to her current job as  \n; lent her financial acumen to boards as  \n and Sotheby\u2019s, and nonprofits including the  \n corporation Accion International and the Hudson River Park Trust; and even briefly contemplated a run for public office?         \n\nWill Ms. Taylor retain her spot as one of the city\u2019s more sought-after hostesses, entertaining media powers like Charlie Rose and Barbara Walters; the  \n-winning scientist Harold E. Varmus; and the social figure and designer Ivanka Trump? And, on a more intimate note, will she and Mr. Bloomberg part ways now that he no longer requires an official consort? Or will they eventually marry?         \n\nIf she is feeling the heat of such scrutiny, Ms. Taylor, who is 58, gives no clue. Her turnout, a square-neck Oscar de la Renta dress and cropped sweater in wrenlike shades of gray and brown, offered a degree of protective coloration. True, she cultivates a spontaneous and down-to-earth aura, her eyes crinkling as she smiles, chattering as delightedly as a girl about the pumps she was wearing \u2014 a bargain, she said, custom-made in Hong Kong.         \n\nAnd yes, she has been known to answer her own phone, dispensing with the multiple aides or publicity personnel one expects to find helicoptering over her.         \n\nShe doesn\u2019t need them: Ms. Taylor is her own best warder. Still, in a rare interview earlier this month, she was candid enough to acknowledge, \u201cI\u2019m often being singled out because of who my significant other is. That\u2019s nice when his approval rating is 70 percent, not so nice when it\u2019s not.\u201d Whatever the mayor\u2019s political standing, \u201cit\u2019s always disconcerting,\u201d Ms. Taylor added, \u201cwhen somebody comes over to you on the bus and says, \u2018I know who you are.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nSuch a claim would seem to place the speaker ahead of many New Yorkers to whom Ms. Taylor remains an elusive figure.         \n\nIndeed, to some she is little more than the mayor\u2019s swell-looking but muted and tirelessly deferential girlfriend, wafting past photographers at public events in a spray of tulle and pearls.         \n\n\u201cPut that down to the Bess Myerson syndrome,\u201d said Kathryn S. Wylde, the president and chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, and a longtime friend of Ms. Taylor. She was referring to the former beauty queen who was Ed Koch\u2019s steady companion during his 1977 mayoral campaign. \u201cDiana Taylor is anything but billionaire arm candy,\u201d Ms. Wylde noted.         \n\nMs. Taylor, a graduate of Dartmouth with an M.B.A. and a degree in public health from Columbia University, has proved adept at juggling a career that includes her present position at Wolfensohn and her spouse-like duties for the mayor. \u201cShe has been able to adapt but remain her own person,\u201d Ms. Wylde said.         \n\nThere is little doubt, though, that her acquired gloss and apparent warmth have helped to soften Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s rough-around-the edges image, lending him the touch of class he has seemed to chase since dating society swans and high achievers like the actress Marisa Berenson, the designer Mary McFadden, and Mary Jane Salk, a writer and the widow of the child psychologist Lee Salk.         \n\nHe was the one who boasted shortly before taking office that Jayne Wrightsman and Annette de la Renta, two of New York City\u2019s most formidable hostesses, regarded him as their \u201cboy toy,\u201d and routinely set him up with their friends. (Mr. Bloomberg is divorced from Susan Brown, with whom he shares two daughters and an apparently cordial relationship. \u201cMy parents are best friends,\u201d his daughter Emma  \n. \u201cNobody understands that until they actually see it.\u201d)         \n\nFor the mayor, \u201cDiana is a trophy,\u201d said Alexandra Lebenthal, the chief executive of a wealth management company who has often rubbed shoulders with Ms. Taylor at business and high-profile social functions.         \n\n\u201cDiana is a catch for any man, no matter how powerful,\u201d Ms. Lebenthal said, adding that should Ms. Taylor one day find herself unattached, \u201cshe would have people coming out of the woodwork for her.\u201d         \n\nDating someone accomplished, age-appropriate and, yes, a half-head taller, has gone a long way toward tempering the reputation of a man who, before becoming mayor, dealt with  \n, and has been accused in the past of uttering  \n.
