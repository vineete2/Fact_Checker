{"headline": "Challenged by Tea Party, Veteran Mississippi Senator Seeks 7th Term", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Thad Cochran, a Mississippi Republican who was first elected to the Senate in 1978, set up a generational and ideological clash in the state\u2019s Republican primary when he announced Friday that he would seek a seventh term in 2014.         \n\n\u201cI will run hard and be successful so that I can continue to serve the people of Mississippi and our nation effectively,\u201d Mr. Cochran said.         \n\nWhile Mr. Cochran, who turns 76 on Saturday, has the support of many leading Republicans in the state, he is already facing opposition from Chris McDaniel, 41, a state senator aligned with the Tea Party, who announced his candidacy in October and has won the support of some conservative groups.         \n\nMr. Cochran, who has raised less than $1 million for his re-election, had been thought to be leaning toward retirement. A group of Mississippi state legislators visited him in his Washington office this week and urged him to run, but he had offered no hint of his plans. Mississippi Republicans said they ultimately believed Mr. McDaniel\u2019s challenge and pleas from powerful figures across the state that Mr. Cochran seek another term prompted the senator to mount what will probably be his final campaign.         \n\nThere is also the prospect of Mr. Cochran reclaiming the chairmanship of the Senate Appropriations Committee if Republicans win back the Senate.         \n\nThe primary could be the toughest race of his career. Mr. Cochran has faced little opposition in his 34 years in the Senate, routinely winning re-election by large margins over little-known Democrats. But the primary could offer insight into fundamental questions about the Republican Party: whether longevity and clout in a Deep South state that has venerated such qualities are enough to overcome national trends toward limited-government conservatism.         \n\nWith some conservatives determined to replace Republicans like Mr. Cochran, he must appeal to elements of the primary electorate that prefer a more ideologically pure senator.         \n\nMr. McDaniel has sought to seize on the new antispending fervor, casting Mr. Cochran \u2014 who has delivered billions of dollars in federal spending projects to his impoverished state \u2014 as an avatar of a bygone political culture.         \n\n\u201cThe national debt is the greatest moral crisis of this generation,\u201d Mr. McDaniel said in announcing his candidacy in October. \u201cSo, let\u2019s go forth from this place making it perfectly clear that the era of big spending is over. The age of appropriations must end.\u201d         \n\nMr. McDaniel has already gotten help in making this case from some conservative groups like the Club for Growth, which is already airing ads in the state praising him as \u201cthe new strong conservative leader Mississippi needs in the U.S. Senate.\u201d         \n\nAfter Mr. Cochran announced his re-election bid Friday, the Club for Growth put out a statement that criticized the senator for his support of earmarked spending projects, for bailing out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and for raising the federal debt limit.         \n\nBut Mr. Cochran is a formidable figure in a state that has long relied on federal largess and that rarely turns over its Senate seats. He will have the support of Mississippi\u2019s political and business establishment, which are deeply worried about what losing Mr. Cochran would mean to a state that, without him, would have little seniority in its congressional delegation.         \n\nHe will also have the support of Washington\u2019s Republican establishment. Invitations to a \u201choliday reception\u201d fund-raiser for Mr. Cochran, at a cost of $5,000 per political action committee, were sent by email to top Republicans in the capital on Friday afternoon. The event \u2014 which will feature Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, who is facing a Tea Party challenge of his own in 2014 \u2014 is scheduled for next week on Capitol Hill.         \n\nLeading Republicans in Mississippi have already begun training their fire on Mr. McDaniel.         \n\nRight after Mr. Cochran announced, his allies began calling top Mississippi Republicans to prepare them for a tough campaign in which the senator will portray Mr. McDaniel as a plaintiff\u2019s lawyer who is a puppet of Washington-based conservative groups.         \n\n\u201cSenator Cochran\u2019s opponent\u2019s record as state senator and his trial lawyer practice are something that the voters of Mississippi will want to take a closer look at, because it\u2019s very different than the commercials that are being funded by out-of-state special interest money,\u201d said Henry Barbour, a well-connected state lobbyist and member of the Republican National Committee. \u201cI certainly will do all I can to help make sure Senator Cochran is re-elected.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/07/us/politics/challenged-by-tea-party-veteran-mississippi-senator-decides-to-run-again.html", "date": "2013-12-06", "description": "Many thought Thad Cochran was going to retire after 34 years in the Senate, but now Mississippi faces a tough Republican primary for his seat."}
