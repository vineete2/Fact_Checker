So Does the State", "body": "\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 As hopeful singles at the speed dating event shifted from table to table introducing themselves, Park Chang-won, a 32-year-old firefighter, grew more and more morose.         \n\nBy the time he reached the last table, Mr. Park, whose dark eyebrows give him a brooding look, was uttering only his name and age. Then he sank into silence.         \n\n\u201cIt felt awkward from the outset,\u201d Mr. Park said later, as he explained that a lifetime spent around men \u2014 at boys\u2019 schools, the military and now as a fireman \u2014 had made meeting women harder.         \n\nAnywhere else, Mr. Park\u2019s dating woes might have been strictly personal. But in South Korea, fretful about plummeting birthrates but still tied to conservative ideas about matchmaking, solving the difficulties of the lovelorn has become something of a national priority. In perhaps the surest sign of that anxiety, the event he attended was one of dozens of dating parties nationwide sponsored by an unlikely matchmaker, the government.         \n\nIn a country where arranged courtships are fading into the past, the Ministry of Health and Welfare began promoting the idea of dating parties in 2010. Under the enthusiastic leadership of its minister at the time, Cheon Jae-hee, it held four parties that year that brought together its workers and employees at local corporations \u2014 making a splash in the news media. Ms. Cheon officiated at the wedding of the first couple who met at one. Featured in a magazine article before the wedding, the 31-year-old groom-to-be thanked the government profusely and wondered if two children would be enough to meet expectations.         \n\nSince then, sponsorship of the parties has shifted mainly to ministry affiliates and local governments, which can win financial rewards for activities that promote marriage and childbirth. The municipal government that threw the party Mr. Park attended has been named a role model by the city of Seoul. One government-financed agency, the Planned Population Federation of Korea, claims a different kind of victory: by hosting parties, it is working to undo its past success when it encouraged vasectomies as a booming South Korea feared being held back by population growth.         \n\nGovernment officials are not the only ones trying to replace the traditional matchmakers that many young people consider increasingly old-fashioned. Corporations, fearing critical shortages of workers in an aging society, have begun ending informal bans against office romances, with some now paying for dating services for their workers. College students have leapt online to set up mass dating events, including a much-publicized  \n last winter in downtown Seoul. And entrepreneurs have opened bars where waiters serve as informal go-betweens.         \n\nThere are online dating services as well, but many young Koreans remain uncomfortable searching for a partner on their own. Most prefer to rely on the companies to take their information and make the match for them.         \n\nSo far, though, the results of these efforts have been mixed. Korean society is organized around group affiliations \u2014 hometown ties and school and corporate friendships \u2014 so meeting a potential spouse without formal introductions to merit family approval has proved difficult, even for those enamored with the concept.         \n\n\u201cI usually date girls I get set up with by my friends, but tonight I came to this party to find someone naturally,\u201d said Yang Sung-mo, 29, who tucked a dapper purple handkerchief into his blazer pocket to attend a bar event for singles. \u201cStill, I doubt it\u2019s going to work unless I am introduced.\u201d         \n\nUntil the 1980s, young people relied on matchmakers and family connections to find spouses, sociologists say. With so many people living in ancestral villages, it was easy for parents to find good matches for their children. Among the criteria considered: family status and birth dates checked by fortune tellers for compatibility.         \n\nThose practices waned as industrialization started an exodus to South Korean cities. Far from traditional networks, families turned to a growing number of dating services that performed background checks. And young people turned to friends whose role is taken seriously enough that they receive gifts at weddings. (Standard thank you presents include tailored suits and cash.)         \n\nBut in recent years, urban youth exposed to the West begun to complain that even the less formal blind dates set up by friends were stressful.
