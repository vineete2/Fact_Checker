{"headline": "Deep Fried and Good for You", "body": "\nFried food is probably not on anyone\u2019s lists of healthy eats, but you have to start with this: Fat is good for you.         \n\nThe long-lived people of Crete might not drink a glass of olive oil a day, but they consume three times as much as we do, and that\u2019s probably more desirable than our misguided notion that the less fat you eat, the better.         \n\nThere are differences among fats, of course, but with trans-fats in full retreat and lard and butter making comebacks, the whole fat-eating thing is starting to make some sense. Of course, the key word is moderation. You can eat fat as long as it\u2019s high quality and you don\u2019t eat it to the exclusion of plants.         \n\nThat\u2019s one reason you shouldn\u2019t reject deep-frying at home; I do it about once a month. The second reason is that you know you love it. The third is that it can be fast and easy. The fourth is that you can deep-fry plants. (And anything else.)         \n\nFrying is thought of as messy, but this can be mitigated by the simplest of measures: using a pot that is heavy, broad and deep, like a well-made stockpot. Choose this, add a fair amount of oil and the process is simplified and neat.         \n\nWhich oil? How much? Since most deep-frying is done at around 350 degrees, this whole notion that olive oil is inappropriate for frying is nonsense; it smokes at 375 (and smoking isn\u2019t the end of the story, either). So olive oil \u2014 especially \u201cpure,\u201d which is a step below extra-virgin and in theory less expensive \u2014 is a fine option, especially for something in which you\u2019d like its flavor, which could include any of the recipes here.         \n\nUnless, that is, you\u2019re seasoning tempura with soy sauce, in which case you might choose peanut oil, which is as flavorful as olive oil, but obviously different. The third excellent option is grapeseed oil, which is as close to neutral as you can find.         \n\nNone of these is as inexpensive as vegetable oil, or soy, or corn or Wesson. And if you don\u2019t have problems with chemical extraction, you might choose one of them; they are, after all, what is used for nearly all commercial deep-frying. If, however, you can afford it and you want the best possible frying experience, use one of those three mentioned above, or at least a cold-pressed neutral oil like safflower or sunflower.         \n\nMoney is an issue, since on the face of it, frying isn\u2019t cheap. When it comes to the \u201chow much\u201d question, I\u2019d say two quarts. That\u2019s not a fixed number, and 48 ounces (1 1/2 quarts, or 6 cups) is probably enough in most cases. Sometimes you can get away with a quart or even less.         \n\nBut more is generally better, and you can reuse the oil quite a few times for deep-frying, stir-frying or saut\u00e9ing, as long as you strain out most solids \u2014 and you need not be fanatic about this; a quick run through a strainer is fine \u2014 and keep it in the refrigerator. (You might consider keeping oil you\u2019re not using in the near future in the refrigerator anyway; rancidity comes from heat and light and it\u2019s nasty. If you have an old bottle of oil sitting around in your kitchen, smell it; you\u2019ll probably throw it away.)         \n\nThe goal of frying is to crisp the outside perfectly and cook the inside just enough, while keeping the whole package from absorbing more than a bit of oil. Most of this happens magically, as long as you follow the rules, which I\u2019ll get to in a second. There are three or four levels of protection you can give the interior, and all of them become satisfying crusts \u2014 again, as long as everything goes right.         \n\nThe first layer of protection is the stuff itself: you allow the outside of the food you\u2019re cooking to become the crisp part (that\u2019s like a French fry, or falafel or \u201cnaked\u201d fried chicken). Then there\u2019s the second layer: a light dusting of cornmeal, flour or the like (I like this with fried squid or fried chicken, especially when seasoned heavily with black pepper). Then a fluffy coating, like tempura or a doughy, pancake-like batter (the latter, it seems to me, is often \u2014 perhaps usually \u2014 overkill). And finally, the old flour, egg and bread crumb treatment, which is, well, yum.         \n\nThey\u2019re all pretty much appropriate for anything. You choose the food you want to fry, you choose the coating, you follow these general instructions and it\u2019ll work.         \n\nStart by putting at least two inches of oil in a heavy and, as I said, deep pot. Less than two inches and you may not be deep-frying; it\u2019ll work, but you might have to turn the food more often, it might stick to the bottom a bit and it might cook less evenly.         \n\nTurn the heat to medium or medium-high and go about your business. Part of that business might be finding a thermometer, because you want that oil to be between 350 and 365 in almost every instance. The heavy pot will help keep that temperature stable.         \n\nYou don\u2019t have to have a thermometer, though, because there are a couple of other ways to know when the oil is ready. It\u2019s just about right when a pinch of flour sizzles without burning immediately; that\u2019s not super-accurate, but if you then add a single piece of food and it first sinks a bit and then immediately rises to the top, the oil is perfect. If it sits on the bottom like a flounder, the oil isn\u2019t hot enough; if it doesn\u2019t sink at all the oil is too hot. The oil is also too hot if it\u2019s smoking.         \n\nAdd your food in batches and don\u2019t crowd; you do not want the temperature to plummet, nor do you want the pieces of food nestling against one another. (Though it\u2019s fine if they bump.) You may or may not have to turn the pieces, but that\u2019s easy, because they\u2019ll be floating and they won\u2019t stick. Remove them with a slotted spoon, tongs or spider; you\u2019ll know when they\u2019re done because the color will be evenly gorgeous.         \n\nTake it slow and either eat the food as it comes out of the fat (you can drain on paper towels or, if you want to be fancy, a cloth napkin) or keep it warm for as little time as possible in a low oven. Myself, I like to fry when people are standing around eating the food as fast as I can produce it; that is really fun. And good for you.
