{"headline": "Global Retailers Join Safety Plan for Bangladesh", "body": "\nUnder mounting pressure to improve working conditions in Bangladesh\u2019s garment factories, several of the world\u2019s largest apparel companies agreed on Monday to a landmark plan to help pay for fire safety and building improvements after the collapse last month of the Rana Plaza factory complex, which killed more than 1,100 people.         \n\nThe agreement, hailed by labor and consumer groups as a major breakthrough, came as the Bangladeshi government also took steps to respond to the April 24 disaster at Rana Plaza outside Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital. In the last two days, the government has pledged to raise wages for garment workers and change labor laws to make it easier to form trade unions.         \n\nThe parallel announcements by global brands and the Bangladeshi government were a significant shift: For years, Bangladesh has seen some of the worst practices in the global garment industry. Wages are the lowest in the world, starting at roughly $37 a month. Factory conditions are often unsafe. Yet global brands have often sought to deflect any direct responsibility for the problems, while the government has often been tepid in protecting worker rights.         \n\nBut the Rana Plaza disaster, the deadliest in the garment industry\u2019s history, has created tremendous pressure for change. On Monday morning,  \n and  \n, owner of the popular Zara chain, endorsed the safety plan. Within hours, the large Dutch retailer \n also joined the agreement, as did the low-cost British retailers  \n and  \n.         \n\n\u201cFire and building safety are extremely important issues for us, and we put a lot of effort and resources within this area,\u201d said Helena Helmersson, head of sustainability at H&M. \u201cWith this commitment we can now influence even more in this issue. We hope for a broad coalition of signatures in order for the agreement to work effectively on the ground.\u201d         \n\nH&M is the largest purchaser of garments from Bangladesh, and its endorsement was seen as influential to other brands. The agreement calls for independent, rigorous factory safety inspections with public accountability and mandatory repairs and renovations underwritten by Western retailers. It also enhances the roles played by workers and unions to ensure factory safety.         \n\n\u201cH&M\u2019s decision to sign the accord is crucial,\u201d said Scott Nova, the executive director of the Worker Rights Consortium, a factory-monitoring group in Washington that is backed by 175 American colleges and universities. \u201cThey are the single largest producer of apparel in Bangladesh, ahead even of Walmart. This accord now has tremendous momentum.\u201d         \n\nLabor groups and others were already trying to pressure other big brands, including Walmart and Gap, to sign onto the agreement. \u201cWe call on these companies to do the right thing on behalf of the more than 1,250 textile workers killed in Bangladesh factory disasters in the last six months, including Rana Plaza, where the tragedy is still unfolding,\u201d said Philip J. Jennings, the general secretary of the UNI Global Union, the international association of trade unions. \u201cThis is black and white, life and death.\u201d         \n\nGap has been the target of an online petition that obtained more than 900,000 signatures in support of the agreement. But the company has resisted signing on, objecting to the agreement\u2019s legally binding nature and arguing that it had already hired a fire inspector and promised $22 million in loans for factory improvements.         \n\n \n, the parent company of Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Izod, announced it would sign the deal, an expanded version of a proposal that PVH had already signed. The new plan lasts five years, while the previous one was to last only two. PVH also announced on Monday that it would contribute $2.5 million to underwrite factory safety improvements as part of the new plan.         \n\nMeanwhile, Bangladesh\u2019s cabinet on Monday approved changes in labor laws. Gowher Rizvi, a top adviser to Bangladesh\u2019s prime minister, said the changes \u2014 which still require approval by Parliament \u2014 are part of a broader government effort to come into compliance with international labor standards and improve on-the-job conditions.         \n\n\u201cWorker safety and worker welfare have now been brought into the forefront,\u201d Mr. Rizvi said in a telephone interview. He said discussions on these changes predated the Rana Plaza collapse but agreed that the disaster had intensified the pressure for reforms.
