{"headline": "Two Architectural Gems in a Changed Setting", "body": "\nThe strip of Fifth Avenue from 34th to 40th Street once formed a royal row of retail, with the jewelry and silver palaces of Gorham and Tiffany at 36th and 37th Streets sharing the throne.         \n\nBut this section of Fifth went off the gold standard long ago. Both businesses lighted out for uptown, and the lower floors of both were mutilated. The restoration of Tiffany in 2002 shows the limits of good intentions.         \n\nThe Gorham Company was founded in 1831, Tiffany & Company in 1837, and by the Civil War era, both were at the forefront of the jewelry and silver business. According to the historian Christopher Monkhouse, a curator at the Art Institute of Chicago, they began a running competition in 1873 to make the best silver object, which he calls the \u201cbattle of the punch bowls.\u201d         \n\nNevertheless, by 1903, when both filed plans for new buildings within a block of each other, there was apparently no competition, no race to open or outdo, and both were working with McKim, Mead & White. Both opened in 1905, Tiffany a deeply modeled screen of marble columns similar to the Palazzo Grimani in Venice, Gorham a more chaste Renaissance palazzo of limestone, with a sumptuous cornice and ground-floor arcade with sculptured panels and a bronze frieze.         \n\nThe first purchase at Gorham is not known, but that at Tiffany was for $10,000. The firm kept $1 million in its safe at night, and had a wagon lift to the basement so that precious goods were not handed across the sidewalk. The interiors were sumptuous. Tiffany had a grand coffered ceiling and columns of silvery gray marble from the Urals, and Gorham a ceiling of broad, shallow arches, covered with decorative relief.         \n\nIn 1905 Architecture Magazine described Tiffany as one of the finest store buildings in America, and in a 1908 issue of The California Architect and Engineer, the French critic Augustin-Adolphe Rey called the Gorham structure \u201cthe most beautiful business building in the world.\u201d         \n\nHowever, in June 1904, as the buildings were nearing completion, the architect Charles P. H. Gilbert complained to The Real Estate Record and Guide about them in the context of Fifth Avenue, saying that the landscape of wildly varying designs was discordant and undesirable.         \n\nGilbert retracted his remarks within the week, having decided that the two buildings were \u201cornaments on Fifth Avenue.\u201d Certainly he was conscious that Edward Holbrook, the head of Gorham, was also an active property developer, having done two town houses for him already. But Gilbert never worked for Holbrook again \u2014 at least, not in  \n.         \n\nPerhaps Gorham and Tiffany saw themselves as allies instead of competitors, united in fighting the common enemy of theft. In 1909 a clerk at a Havana hotel posed as the manager and flimflammed both stores out of more than a thousand dollars and a few gems, baiting them with a promise of a huge order. He escaped by ocean liner.         \n\nBy the 1940s both companies had relocated, and their old neighborhood was sliding downhill. In 1951 the owner of the Tiffany building ripped out much of the ground floor, provoking Lewis Mumford to use his column in The New Yorker to call for the creation of a \u201cSociety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Buildings.\u201d         \n\nThen in 1960 the owner of the Gorham building  \n columns, carvings and the rest of the lower facade in favor of a grid of aluminum and glass.         \n\nThe pendulum of architectural taste has a wide swing, and in 2000 the  \n family, owners of the Gorham building, announced plans to recreate the missing ground floor with a trompe l\u2019oeil mural on the front, something preservationists viewed with suspicion, preferring a true restoration.         \n\nThe Schwalbes never went ahead, but in 2002 the architects Beyer Blinder Belle recreated the ground floor of the Tiffany building, removing the jumbled storefronts that had taken over, and scrupulously rebuilding the giant marble pilasters on the front, which had been cut off at the bottom.         \n\nBut high-mindedness goes only so far. The curtailment\u00a0of the blaring storefronts at Tiffany was like a blast of air-conditioning\u00a0in a hot attic, but the recreation of the lower\u00a020 feet\u00a0of\u00a0marble did not work out so well, and the bright new material at the bottom\u00a0suggests a pair of khakis dipped in bleach.         \n\nThe Gorham building is made of granite and limestone, both\u00a0much easier to match than marble, but\u00a0replacing the intricate carving would be costly. And while the Tiffany facade is deeply modeled, that of the Gorham is flat, and depended heavily on the luxurious bronze storefront, an expensive proposition to replicate.         \n\nThe Schwalbe family is working with the architect Arthur Kahane on various repairs, and he says he has prepared drawings for an actual Gorham restoration. Mr. Kahane proposes using cast stone instead of granite and limestone, which would be met cautiously by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. He won\u2019t say what it would cost, but the estimate 13 years ago was $7 million. Still, Mr. Kahane said, \u201cthis client is concerned about aesthetics; if anybody is going to do it, they would.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/16/realestate/two-architectural-gems-in-a-changed-setting.html", "date": "2013-06-13", "description": "Time was when Tiffany and Gorham sold treasures out of sumptuous stores in Murray Hill."}
