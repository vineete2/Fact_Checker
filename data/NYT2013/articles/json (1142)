{"headline": "For Army Football, a Duty to Win Again", "body": "\nNo one wanted Army to beat Navy more than Rich Ellerson did. Coaching at Army was his dream job. His father was a  \n graduate and a career military officer, as were two of his brothers. One of them, John, was a captain of the 1962 team. Ellerson\u2019s son Andrew is a cadet and the Black Knights\u2019 long snapper.         \n\nEllerson had grown up on bases around the world and had listened to Army-Navy games on shortwave radios. He understood what a victory would mean to generations of Army men and women, especially after 11 consecutive losses to their rival. Ellerson also knew that if he lost to the Midshipmen for the fifth time in his tenure, he was going to lose his job.         \n\nOn Saturday,  \n. On Sunday night,  \n, having compiled a 20-41 record at West Point. In 2010, he went 7-6 in a season that culminated with  \n in the Armed Forces Bowl, the Black Knights\u2019 first postseason victory since 1985. But Ellerson\u2019s winless record against Navy and his 1-4 record against Air Force were his undoing.         \n\nNow Army is looking for its fifth coach in 13 years, and there is urgency among those atop the chain of command that matches the frustration of the Army faithful.  \n sent Sunday to prominent alumni announcing Ellerson\u2019s firing, Lt. Gen. Robert L. Caslen Jr., the superintendent of the academy, said that his goal was to \u201cquickly build a winning program\u201d and that he was considering institutional changes to make that happen.         \n\n\u201cWhen America puts its sons and daughters in harm\u2019s way, they do not expect us to just \u2018do our best,\u2019 but to win,\u201d wrote Caslen, who was appointed superintendent in July. \u201cNothing short of victory is acceptable. That fundamental ethos is at the heart of this academy. It must be ingrained in every one of our athletic programs. Our core values are duty, honor, country. Winning makes them real.\u201d         \n\nThose who have spent time among the cadets \u2014 as I did for a recent book, \u201c \n,\u201d about the program under Ellerson \u2014 can tell you that they have never been around a group of young men who wanted to win so much but were essentially trailing by two touchdowns before they ever stepped on the football field.         \n\nThey balance the rigors of an Ivy League-quality education, taking 17 to 20 hours of classes a semester, with year-round physical and tactical training to maintain the discipline the military demands. Playing football is at once the easiest, most fun and least important thing they do over the course of their 47 months as an officer in training.         \n\nThere is no summer vacation, or even much opportunity to take a course over the summer to lighten the academic load in season. The incoming freshmen start Beast Barracks \u2014 or basic training \u2014 in late June, and upperclassmen must take part in leadership training that can include simulated combat missions and Ranger School and can take cadets to places like Fort Benning, Ga., and Germany.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to do a better job in sequencing,\u201d Athletic Director Boo Corrigan said. \u201cThese guys come out of training all beat up and then go right into football camp. We\u2019re not looking to get them out of it, but for a better way.\u201d         \n\nBobby Ross won a share of a national championship while the coach at Georgia Tech, and he took the San Diego Chargers to the Super Bowl. But in January 2007, after going 9-25 in three seasons at Army,  \n, frustrated that he could not persuade West Point administration to ease admission and training policies. He wanted better and bigger players, but he could not get them in or keep them big.         \n\nEllerson recognized it, too, and he made a series of adjustments to ease the burden on his team, including moving practices to the morning and holding breakfasts at the football center so he could better monitor his players\u2019 rest and nutrition. It was an uphill battle.         \n\nI saw that myself in 2011, when I watched Steve Erzinger, already undersize as a 210-pound linebacker, shrink to 190 pounds. He was hardly alone. On any given Saturday, the Black Knights are outweighed by 50 pounds along the line, and after the game, the training room is standing room only. Nagging injuries become chronic ones because cadets still must attend to their military duties, go to class and visit the library. There is no rest or recovery.         \n\nCorrigan, the athletic director, acknowledged that there were administrative fixes that needed to be made to ease the pressure on the new coaching staff, as well as the cadet-athletes. Army fund-raising is up, as is ticket revenue. Corporate sponsorships have created new revenue. The athletic department has some money, and Corrigan is looking to spend it on an additional coach and an additional recruiting coordinator.
