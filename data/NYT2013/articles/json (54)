{"headline": "Next Made-in-China Boom: College Graduates", "body": "\nSANYA, China \u2014 Zhang Xiaoping\u2019s mother dropped out of school after sixth grade. Her father, one of 10 children, never attended.         \n\nBut Ms. Zhang, 20, is part of a new generation of Chinese taking advantage of a national effort to produce college graduates in numbers the world has never seen before.         \n\nA pony-tailed junior at a new university here in southern China, Ms. Zhang has a major in English. But her unofficial minor is American pop culture, which she absorbs by watching episodes of television shows like \u201cThe Vampire Diaries\u201d and \u201cAmerica\u2019s Next Top Model\u201d on the Internet.         \n\nIt is all part of her highly specific ambition: to work some day for a Chinese automaker and provide the cultural insights and English fluency the company needs to supply the next generation of fuel-efficient taxis that New York City plans to choose in 2021. \u201cIt is my dream,\u201d she said, \u201cand I will devote myself wholeheartedly to it.\u201d         \n\nEven if her dream is only dorm-room reverie, China has tens of millions of Ms. Zhangs \u2014 bright young people whose aspirations and sheer numbers could become potent economic competition for the West in decades to come.         \n\nChina is making a $250 billion-a-year investment in what economists call human capital. Just as the United States helped build a white-collar middle class in the late 1940s and early 1950s by using the G.I. Bill to help educate millions of World War II veterans, the Chinese government is using large subsidies to educate tens of millions of young people as they move from farms to cities.         \n\nThe aim is to change the current system, in which a tiny, highly educated elite oversees vast armies of semi-trained factory workers and rural laborers. China wants to move up the development curve by fostering a much more broadly educated public, one that more closely resembles the multifaceted labor forces of the United States and Europe.         \n\nIt is too early to know how well the effort will pay off.         \n\nWhile potentially enhancing China\u2019s future as a global industrial power, an increasingly educated population poses daunting challenges for its leaders. With the Chinese economy downshifting in the past year to a slower growth rate, the country faces a glut of college graduates with high expectations and limited opportunities.         \n\nMuch depends on whether China\u2019s authoritarian political system can create an educational system that encourages the world-class creativity and innovation that modern economies require, and that can help generate enough quality jobs.         \n\nChina also faces formidable difficulties in dealing with widespread corruption, a sclerotic political system, severe environmental damage, inefficient state-owned monopolies and other problems. But if these issues can be surmounted, a better educated labor force could help China become an ever more formidable rival to the West.         \n\n\u201cIt will move China forward in its economy, in scientific innovation and politically, but the new rising middle class will also put a lot of pressure on the government to change,\u201d said Wang Huiyao, the director general of the Center for China and Globalization, a Beijing-based research group.         \n\nTo the extent that China succeeds, its educational leap forward could have profound implications in a globalized economy in which a growing share of goods and services is traded across international borders. Increasingly, college graduates all over the world compete for similar work, and the boom in higher education in China is starting to put pressure on employment opportunities for college graduates elsewhere \u2014 including in the United States.         \n\nChina\u2019s current five-year plan, through 2015, focuses on seven national development priorities, many of them new industries that are in fashion among young college graduates in the West. They are alternative energy, energy efficiency, environmental protection, biotechnology, advanced information technologies, high-end equipment manufacturing and so-called new energy vehicles, like hybrid and all-electric cars.         \n\nChina\u2019s goal is to invest up to 10 trillion renminbi, or $1.6 trillion, to expand those industries to represent 8 percent of economic output by 2015, up from 3 percent in 2010.         \n\nAt the same time, many big universities are focusing on existing technologies in industries where China poses a growing challenge to the West.
