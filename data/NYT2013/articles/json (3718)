{"headline": "Giants Stay Home for Summer Camp", "body": "\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. \u2014 Once upon a time,  \n training camps were like other summer camps: dormitory-style rooms in a country setting, a day overloaded with physical activities, communal meals and lots of late-night bonding.         \n\nFor the players, the camp experience, which in their case sometimes included sneaking out in the evening to drink at local bars, was widely viewed as essential to the unity and camaraderie of the team.         \n\nThis year, the Giants, like many other N.F.L. teams, have not gone away to a relatively remote location in New York, Connecticut, Vermont or Oregon, as they had for nearly 80 years. The Giants instead chose to stay in the Meadowlands, where several years ago, they built a state-of-the-art practice facility with offices, meeting and locker rooms, multiple grass fields and a vast indoor field house. The players are housed in a swanky hotel overlooking the Giants\u2019 compound.         \n\nBut is it training camp if you don\u2019t go away? What about sneaking out at night? What about the pranks in dorms? What about the rotten, ill-suited beds?         \n\n\u201cI do kind of miss that traditional camp life,\u201d Giants quarterback Eli Manning said. \u201cThe fun part of training camp was that we were in dorms with large common rooms to gather in. You would get four guys together, and some other guys would come by and we\u2019d sit around watching TV and joking around. That was a good thing.\u201d         \n\nBut the little-boy-on-a-sleepover concept swirled in Manning\u2019s head for only so long. He looked wistful as he spoke of camps past, but he understood reality. The colossal practice complexes that many N.F.L. teams have built are serious-minded places that maximize a team\u2019s output. Why leave these palaces of productivity to go to some college campus in the hypothetical search of team harmony?         \n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s setup is certainly more efficient,\u201d Manning said. \u201cYou\u2019re not driving back and forth to the cafeteria or having a long walk to a meeting or to practice. Everything is here in one place: meeting rooms, video, the computers, the weight room, the meals. We come in at 8:30 for our first morning meeting and then we\u2019re here the rest of the day.\u201d         \n\nBut a camp by definition connotes some form of relaxation or recreation. Players living in dorms were renowned for taking naps after lunch and for playing poker at night \u2014 or for taking naps because they were up late playing poker.         \n\n\u201cAll those things were true,\u201d the former Giants quarterback Phil Simms said. \u201cGuys snuck out at night and guys pulled all kinds of pranks on each other. It was a lot of fun. And in camp, you did get reacquainted with guys you hadn\u2019t seen all winter because lots of guys would go home after the season ended.         \n\n\u201cBut the game has completely changed since then. The players don\u2019t go home for the winter; instead, they stay and work out with their teammates in the off-season. They have these fabulous practice complexes, so why would they go to some subpar place? And all that sneaking out at night stuff would be impossible to do now anyway. If five guys snuck out late, someone would take a picture of them, tweet it, and those five guys would be getting ripped all over sports talk radio the next morning. It\u2019s just not the same game or the same world.\u201d         \n\nThe itinerary of a typical N.F.L. camp has also been altered by labor agreements, which greatly reduce the daily practice and meeting demands on the players. Gone are two-a-day practices. There are frequent days off. It becomes less important to have everyone in a remote college-like setting when training camp is turned into something like a 9-to-5 workday.         \n\nJohn Mara, a Giants co-owner, has been visiting N.F.L. training camps for more than 50 years.         \n\n\u201cYou do lose something by not being in a dormitory setting, there\u2019s no question about it,\u201d Mara said. \u201cBut there are many other considerations now, like the weather and an indoor facility. Because of the new collective bargaining agreement, we have a limited number of training camp days to practice. Missing a few days to rain is a bigger problem than it once was.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/07/sports/football/giants-put-training-camp-on-the-home-schedule.html", "date": "2013-08-06", "description": "The Giants are part of the trend of N.F.L. teams holding training camp at home at their permanent facilities rather than on a remote campus, but either location has its pros and cons."}
