{"headline": "Emotional Victory for Mickelson\u2019s Caddie of 21 Years", "body": "\nGULLANE, Scotland         \n\n \n drained the last of his six birdie putts Sunday to end his long and winding road to the British Open championship. He picked the ball out of the cup and raised his arms high while his longtime caddie, Jim Mackay, calmly replaced the flagstick on the 18th hole at Muirfield.         \n\nAnd then one of the driest Opens in recent memory got all wet. Mackay and Mickelson embraced, with one sobbing into the other\u2019s shoulder. Only it wasn\u2019t Mickelson crying but Mackay, who later explained while choking back more tears, \u201cYou work for a guy for 21 years, it\u2019s pretty cool when you see him playing the best round of golf you\u2019ve ever seen him play in the last round to win the British Open.\u201d         \n\nMickelson, who began the day five strokes behind the 54-hole leader, Lee Westwood, birdied four of his last six holes Sunday on his way to a round of five-under-par 66 that included one bogey, then waited for the final four twosomes to finish to see if his three-under 281 would hold up.         \n\nBefore they teed off, Mackay gave Mickelson a target to shoot for. \u201cI said even par or one under could win this thing,\u201d said Mackay, who was referring to the cumulative score. According to Mackay, Mickelson replied, \u201cI\u2019m going to be better than that.\u201d         \n\nIt was the only time all week they weren\u2019t on the same page, although both were right. The second-place finisher, Henrik Stenson, finished with an even-par 284. Stenson was one stroke ahead of Ian Poulter (67), Adam Scott (72) and Westwood (75).         \n\nIt took roughly an hour for Mickelson\u2019s maiden British Open victory to become official, and during most of that time he was huddled with his wife and three children outside the scoring trailer. Mackay stood outside the clubhouse fielding questions from reporters and congratulations from caddies and players.         \n\nZach Johnson, who opened with the same score that Mickelson closed with, shook Mackay\u2019s hand and said, \u201cMan, I didn\u2019t know that was out there.\u201d         \n\nJohnson posted a 72 to finish tied for sixth at two over. John Wood, the caddie for Hunter Mahan, who shot a 75, also sought out Mackay.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a certain number of guys out here like Bones who do this job not for the money or for any other reason but to help their players become the greatest they can be,\u201d Wood said, referring to Mackay by his nickname.         \n\nMickelson appreciates the asset he has in Mackay, and not just because he helps him pull the right clubs in the kind of tough winds they weathered Sunday. Brandt Snedeker, who finished second to Mickelson at this year\u2019s Phoenix Open, recently recalled a conversation he had with Mickelson about Mackay.         \n\n\u201cPhil said a great thing,\u201d Snedeker said. \u201cHe said, \u2018Listen, Bones is the only guy on the golf course that wants me to play well, so why am I going to sit there and berate him and treat him poorly? He\u2019s the only guy trying to work his tail off for me.\u2019\u201d         \n\nBeside every great player there is a great caddie. Jack Nicklaus had Angelo Argea. For 13 of his major victories, Tiger Woods had Steve Williams. And since the summer of 1992, Mickelson has had Mackay, who is the only full-time caddie he has employed since turning pro.         \n\nAfter Mickelson\u2019s victory, the Englishman Luke Donald, a former world No. 1, posted on Twitter: \u201cPhil and Bones are the best player/caddy partnership in golf. It\u2019s hard to last as long as they have together yet they have done it with ease.\u201d         \n\nTheir partnership has endured three years longer than the one between Nicklaus and Argea and easily twice as long as many marriages on tour. In the world of sports, where the only constant is change, Mickelson and Mackay stand out. They have been together five years longer than Gregg Popovich and Tim Duncan and eight years more than Bill Belichick and Tom Brady.         \n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t really words to describe what he means not just to Phil but to our family,\u201d Mickelson\u2019s wife, Amy, said as she made her way to the 18th green for the award presentation.         \n\nPardoning herself, she said, \u201cI\u2019m going to go snuggle up with Bones now.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/22/sports/golf/emotional-victory-for-mickelsons-caddie-of-21-years-at-british-open.html", "date": "2013-07-21", "description": "After Phil Mickelson\u2019s British Open victory, the only full-time caddie he has ever had, Jim Mackay, showed even more emotion than he did."}
