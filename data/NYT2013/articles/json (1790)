{"headline": "Jets Overcome Their Mistakes With One Long Pass", "body": "\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. \u2014 On game days, Santonio Holmes wears orange-tinted contact lenses. \u201cI can stand here and look right into this light,\u201d Holmes said, \u201cand I don\u2019t have to worry about breaking my eyes.\u201d         \n\nAs he spoke, Holmes pointed to an overhead panel in an interview room. A smile creased a face streaked with eye black. In the room, the glare was not so harsh. But about 45 minutes earlier, Holmes had to contend with the bank of lights that rim the top of MetLife Stadium.         \n\nHe sprinted down the right sideline. After 20 yards, he turned his head and looked up. From that brightness came a football, which left quarterback Geno Smith\u2019s right hand as if shot by an arrow. It landed on Holmes\u2019s fingertips like a bird returning to its nest, and he cradled it as he scampered into the end zone.         \n\nSo much of what happened during the Jets\u2019 27-20 victory Sunday against the Buffalo Bills strained the bounds of plausibility. The  \n committed a team-record 20 penalties, for 163 yards. They allowed 14 unanswered points to an offense that into the third quarter was as potent as a waterlogged matchbook. They amassed 513 yards, the most in the 73-game tenure of Coach  \n \u2014 and against a defense operated by the Jets\u2019 former coordinator Mike Pettine \u2014 and yet barely escaped MetLife Stadium with more wins than losses this season.         \n\nDespite it all, as the score remained tied and time ticked away, one thing seemed apparent, if not downright obvious: Smith would throw the ball in Holmes\u2019s direction. And Holmes would catch it.         \n\n\u201cSantonio\u2019s been ballin\u2019 since me and him got drafted together,\u201d said right guard Willie Colon, who played with Holmes in Pittsburgh. \u201cThat\u2019s the only Santonio I know. He\u2019s a lot of things, but he\u2019s a gamer. And I love him to death.\u201d         \n\nHolmes is, as Colon said, a lot of things. Mercurial. Petulant. Cunning. Also talented. Remarkably talented, almost unfairly so. He injured his foot 51 weeks ago, and in the interim he has kept teammates and the news media guessing as to the true state of his health. He can sound grim and buoyant, often in the same sentence. On Sunday, he caught five passes for 154 yards, a career high, including that winning touchdown.         \n\n\u201cToday was a good opportunity to showcase how well I can be from this point forward,\u201d Holmes said.         \n\nFor the next week, the Jets will revel in being 2-1 heading into challenging games at Tennessee and Atlanta \u2014 they are a game behind unbeaten New England and Miami in the A.F.C. East \u2014 because there are plenty of reasons, dating to that bizarre season-opening victory against Tampa Bay, that their record could be 1-2, or worse.         \n\n\u201cI know this team\u2019s going to get better,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we can\u2019t.\u201d         \n\nThey will revel in a defense that pummeled Buffalo quarterback E. J. Manuel (eight sacks) and in a revived running game (182 yards, including 149 by Bilal Powell), but also \u2014 and especially \u2014 in that throw by Smith and that catch by Holmes.         \n\nIt went for 69 yards, and it came with 9 minutes 23 seconds remaining, two plays after Buffalo, which trailed by 20-6 almost midway through the third quarter, had evened the score at 20-20. The  \n took advantage of the Jets\u2019 offensive struggles, kicking one field goal and then another, before cornerback Kyle Wilson\u2019s self-destruction \u2014 penalties on three consecutive plays, and a 12-yard catch allowed to Stevie Johnson \u2014 put them in position for the tying score, a 33-yard catch by Scott Chandler.         \n\nThree games into this season, a theme has emerged for the Jets. As capable as Smith is of committing a mindless turnover \u2014 he threw two more ugly interceptions Sunday, running his season total to six \u2014 he is just as likely to do something, anything, that sends jolts of excitement and anticipation rippling through the crowd and the Jets\u2019 sideline.         \n\nSmith completed 16 of 29 passes for 331 yards and 2 touchdowns, benefiting from a receiving corps that, after dropping six passes against New England, followed through on its pledge to hold onto the ball. No one did it better than Holmes, who made diving catches and leaping grabs and over-the-shoulder snares before; as afternoon gave way to evening, he hauled in the prettiest pass Smith threw all game.         \n\nHolmes was matched up in single coverage against the reserve cornerback Justin Rogers, who replaced the injured Leodis McKelvin and was victimized earlier on Stephen Hill\u2019s 51-yard touchdown. Rogers so blanketed Holmes that a legal pad could not slide between their bodies, but Holmes sensed that Rogers was unaware that the ball was even arcing their way.         \n\nAll week in practice, Holmes worked on over-the-shoulder catches. He abides by a general rule on deep passes: never turn around until 20 yards into the route. \u201cThey read your eyes and your hands,\u201d Holmes said of defensive backs. \u201cAnd if I never give them an opportunity to see my eyes getting bigger before the catch or my hands coming for the ball, you\u2019d never know that the ball will get there.\u201d         \n\nHe added, \u201cIt\u2019s something that we work on: don\u2019t look back.\u201d         \n\nThe skill of Holmes that entrances Ryan most is his knack for extending his hands at the last possible moment.         \n\n\u201cNo matter how tight the coverage, you can\u2019t make the play on it until you see his hands go where his eyes go,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cAnd Holmes is just incredible at that.\u201d         \n\nThe ball arrived, an inch or two past Rogers\u2019s fingers and right onto Holmes\u2019s.         \n\n\u201cJust wanted to give him a good chance,\u201d Smith said. \u201cGive him a good ball.\u201d         \n\nHolmes caught the pass at the Buffalo 40. Rogers fell, and Holmes zipped the remaining distance toward a froth of jubilant fans. He extended his arms, as if flying, He celebrated with Hill, bumping chests. And then he looked up.         \n\nEXTRA POINTS         \n\nRunning back Chris Ivory, who has had hamstring problems throughout his career, injured his hamstring on the Jets\u2019 second series and did not return.
