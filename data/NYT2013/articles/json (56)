{"headline": "The Beauty of Bacteria", "body": "\nIF we\u2019re to believe half a century of daytime TV commercials, housekeeping is war \u2014 a perpetual battle against the sneaky soldiers of nature. For decades, we\u2019ve armed ourselves with cleaning products to slay bacteria, scrape away fungus and torture mites. As our household organisms move up the evolutionary ladder, acquiring wings and faces, we hire mercenaries to drive them out.         \n\nTwo recent developments, however, suggest a d\u00e9tente between nature and domestic culture.         \n\nThis month, Pantone, a company best known for its color-matching system, announced that the color of the year for 2013 is emerald green. Never before, in 14 years of these selections, has a true green been named, possibly because it is also the color of mold, lobster liver and brussels sprouts.         \n\nPantone was not put off. \u201cNo other color conveys regeneration more,\u201d the company\u2019s news release noted about the \u201cvivid, verdant\u201d hue known as  \n. It seems that as we become more environmentally considerate (and possibly also more susceptible to the color of money), we\u2019re ready to ignore the ick factor and welcome green into our homes.         \n\nThe idea that nature might be an honored houseguest and not just something that slithers in under the refrigerator is also behind \u201cBio Design: Nature, Science, Creativity,\u201d a book published last month by the Museum of Modern Art.         \n\nWritten by William Myers, a New York-based writer and teacher,  \n focuses on the growing movement to integrate organic processes in the creation of buildings and household objects so that resources are conserved and waste is limited. Some astonishing visual effects are produced as well. The book\u2019s 73 projects, culled from laboratories and design studios around the world, show, for example, how living trees can be coaxed into becoming houses and bridges; how lamps can be powered by firefly luminescence; how human DNA can change the color of petunias; and how concrete can heal itself when damaged, like skin.         \n\nMr. Myers said his interest in the redemptive power of small, creepy things started years ago when he began making his own bread and beer, and developed a familiarity with yeast. We have been conditioned to fear micro-organisms, he said, \u201cbut in fact they can be useful and have been for millenniums, if you think about baking and brewing.\u201d         \n\nAlso influential on Mr. Myers was \u201cDesign and the Elastic Mind,\u201d a 2008 exhibition organized by Paola Antonelli at the Museum of Modern Art, which presented a number of visionary collaborations between designers and scientists. (One of the show\u2019s most memorable projects,  \n a tiny jacket cultured from living mouse cells, appears in Mr. Myers\u2019s book.)         \n\nDesigners habitually copy nature. The examples pile up faster than beetle species and include things like Antonio Gaud\u00ed\u2019s soaring architecture, William Morris\u2019s floral wallpaper and George Nakashima\u2019s rough wood tables. Cutting-edge technology takes away nothing from nature-inspired designs, but instead enhances them. In 2006, the Dutch designer Joris Laarman introduced a chair modeled by computer along the principles of  \n, so that the parts of the chair subjected to the greatest stress were thickest, while those subjected to the least amount of stress were carved away. The result was an efficient use of material and a spectacular form.         \n\nBut bio design is not about merely taking cues from organic structures and operations. It\u2019s about harnessing the machinery of the natural world to perform as nature does: storing and converting energy, producing oxygen, neutralizing poisons and disposing wastes in life-sustaining ways.         \n\nMr. Laarman\u2019s 2010  \n lamp is a good example. A prototype for a lampshade coated with hamster ovary cells modified with firefly DNA, it generates an enzymatic reaction that causes the lamp to light up, after a fashion, batteries not required.         \n\nWhat the Halflife lamp does require is a continuous supply of nutrients to keep the cells alive. As designers explore new ways to make and dispose of household goods, they gesture at new relationships between owners and possessions. \u201cWe\u2019re used to thinking we can throw away objects,\u201d Mr. Laarman said by phone from Amsterdam. \u201cWe\u2019re not used to objects you can care for or treat well, or that renew themselves.\u201d         \n\nHamster ovary cells as pets? In the wonderland of biotechnology, bacteria is beautiful, moss is electric and decorative tiles are animated.         \n\nConsider  \n, a chandelier designed by Petia Morozov of Montclair, N.J., with petri dishes loaded with bacterial cultures nesting in a tangle of fiber optics. The pattern and color of the blooming bacteria (ideally supplied by individual family members, including pets) changes the quality of the light.         \n\nOr  \n, a collaboration between the designers Carlos Peralta and Alex Driver of Britain and the scientist Paolo Bombelli of Italy, which exploits the small electrical current produced when certain bacteria consume organic compounds released by moss during photosynthesis. Using carbon fiber to absorb the charge and a battery to supplement it, the scientists produced enough electricity with their table to power an attached lamp.
