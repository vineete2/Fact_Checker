{"headline": "Divisions Form in Atlanta as Bail Is Set in Cheating Case", "body": "\nATLANTA \u2014 Confusion, anger and charges of racism played out at the Fulton County Jail here on Tuesday as the process of booking 35 educators in the nation\u2019s largest school-cheating scandal began.         \n\nThe sharpest focus was on Beverly L. Hall, the former school superintendent who rose through the education ranks in Newark and New York City and who was named superintendent of the year during her 12 years with the Atlanta district.         \n\nA grand jury on Friday charged Dr. Hall and the other educators with essentially running a conspiracy in which standardized test scores were secretly raised as a way to get bonuses and ensure job security.         \n\nAs the day unfolded Tuesday, however, the judicial system appeared unprepared for the initial stages of the prosecution.         \n\nThe teachers, principals and administrators had been told that they had to report to jail by Tuesday, at which time they could argue to have bail amounts as high as $7.5 million reduced. As evening came, only 18 had been processed, but several had won a break in their bond requirements.         \n\nMost notably, Dr. Hall negotiated her $7.5 million bond \u2014 considered a largely punitive figure set by the grand jurors, some of whom argued for it to be $10 million \u2014 down to $200,000. She was allowed to use her signature to cover $150,000 of it, with the rest to be paid in cash, said David Bailey, one of her lawyers. She will pay only 10 percent of that, and most of it will be refunded, he said. Dr. Hall arrived at the jail to be processed around 7:30 p.m., surrounded by her lawyers. She left the jail about 11 p.m.         \n\nLawyers for the defendants, saying they were baffled by what appeared to be a lack of coordination between District Attorney Paul L. Howard Jr., the jail and the courts, were working to try to reduce the amount of bond set for teachers who had no criminal records and to keep them from spending time in jail.         \n\nOne of the first to arrive was Theresia Copeland, 56, who had been testing coordinator at a southeast Atlanta elementary school. She walked into the jail about 7 a.m. and was booked on a $1 million bond on charges of racketeering, theft and making false statements.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never had anything in education like this,\u201d said Warren Fortson, a lawyer for Ms. Copeland and two other teachers.         \n\n\u201cAl Capone, I understand, didn\u2019t have to post a $1 million bond,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think a Cobb County grandmother needs $1 million to secure her.\u201d         \n\nLater, Ms. Copeland\u2019s bail was reduced to $50,000. Others also secured reduced bonds. Only one educator was still under a $1 million bond by Tuesday evening, said a spokeswoman for the Fulton County Sheriff\u2019s Office, Tracy Flanagan.         \n\nAll totaled, Ms. Copeland and the other educators face 65 charges in a cheating scandal that first came to light in 2009. A team of state-appointed investigators spent 21 months looking into allegations that teachers and administrators at a handful of Atlanta schools routinely changed test scores or gave students correct answers. That report became the basis for the criminal charges issued Friday.         \n\nDr. Hall, who retired in 2011, was charged with racketeering, theft, influencing witnesses, conspiracy and making false statements. As she has from the beginning of the investigation, she denied any knowledge of cheating.         \n\n\u201cWe have faith in the justice system, and she has faith the courts will do what\u2019s right,\u201d Mr. Bailey said. He noted that part of her bond reduction agreement included a promise not to speak publicly about the case until the court allowed her to do so.         \n\nIf convicted, Dr. Hall could face up to 40 years in prison.         \n\nWhile defense lawyers worked to have their clients freed, a group of black clergy members and former educators spoke out, calling the charges and the bail extreme and an indication of a deeper, long-simmering racial divide in the city and the state.         \n\nThe Rev. Timothy McDonald, a spokesman for the group Concerned Black Clergy, noted that the investigators were white and the accused were largely black.         \n\n\u201cLook at the pictures of those 35,\u201d he said. \u201cShow me a white face. Let\u2019s just be for real. You can call it racist, you can call it whatever you want, but this is overkill. We have seen people with much deeper crimes with much less bond set.\u201d         \n\n \n, former MayorShirley Franklin of Atlanta on Tuesday called the fury surrounding the indictments \u201ca public hanging\u201d and called for fairness and justice as the case proceeds.         \n\n\u201cSay a prayer for a fair trial for all those charged, say a prayer for every family and child who has been touched by the scandal and say a prayer to calm the public lynching mob mentality that has begun,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIn times like these, reflection and soul-searching are powerful tools to ground our actions and decision-making.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/03/us/atlanta-cheating-scandal-jailing-educators.html", "date": "2013-04-02", "description": "Confusion and charges of racism suggested the judicial system was not ready for the initial stages of prosecuting 35 educators in the nation\u2019s largest school-cheating scandal."}
