{"headline": "The Boyhood Tides That Formed Baseball\u2019s Sandman", "body": "\nChildren do not play ball on the beach at Puerto Caimito the way they did when  \n was a boy. Erosion and construction have changed the dimensions of the beach, and a new field nearby actually has grass.         \n\nBut when Rivera was growing up, groomed grass fields were hard to come by in the little Pacific fishing village in Panama. The best playing surface in the area was a vast expanse of hard, white sand that revealed itself at low tide, a field strewn with rocks, shells and remnants of abandoned fishing vessels.         \n\n\u201cThat beach at low tide, that was our Yankee Stadium, that was our Maracan\u00e3,\u201d Rivera said, referring to his place of work in the Bronx and to the soccer palace in Rio de Janeiro. \u201cThe tide went way, way out and gave us a huge field right there. But when the tide came in, there was no more field.\u201d         \n\nAt that point, as the waterline crept back to shore, the children said goodbye to one another and, depending on the time of day, went home, to school or to work on the fishing boats.         \n\nIt was on that makeshift field that Rivera learned to play the sport he went on to master like nobody else. But now, after decades of unparalleled success on some of the most immaculate playing fields on the planet, the inescapable tide of age is bearing down for good on Rivera\u2019s playing days.         \n\nIt is almost time for him to go home.         \n\nRivera \u2014 nicknamed Sandman, not for the formative years on that beach but for the Metallica song that accompanied him on his ritual jog from the bullpen to the pitcher\u2019s mound at Yankee Stadium \u2014 is retiring after a 19-year major league career and will be in uniform for the last time in New York on Thursday. He has amassed 652 saves, 51 more than Trevor Hoffman, the next closest reliever, who retired after the 2010 season. In the postseason, Rivera saved an additional 42 games, with an almost absurd 0.70 earned run average in 141 innings.         \n\nHis journey to baseball immortality began on that beach at Puerto Caimito, about an hour\u2019s drive southwest of Panama City. The town lies at the head of a small cove, and at low tide the water was sucked so far out that there were acres of flat, firm ground on which to play.         \n\nRivera\u2019s family home was 50 feet from the high-water mark, he said, closer to the sea at high tide than a pitcher\u2019s rubber is to home plate. All it took was a peek outside to see if anyone was there, and it was easy to hear the sounds of other children playing. Rivera would be out on the sand in an instant. (Years ago, his house was torn down along with other modest buildings next to the beach. Rivera built a new inland estate for his family in the same town.)         \n\nIn a village where fishing was the livelihood for 70 percent to 80 percent of the families, virtually everyone had an inherent sense of the tides. For the fathers and young men, high tide meant it was time to launch the boats. For the children, low tide was an invitation to play baseball, or soccer, which Rivera also adored.         \n\nThey used old clothes, milk cartons, tennis balls, egg-shape rubber balls \u2014 whatever could be found \u2014 for the balls and the mitts, and the occasional broomstick handle or tree branches for bats. For soccer goals they used shoes or piles of clothes, perhaps a palm tree frond stuck into the sand, and they played for as long as the tide permitted, boys and girls together, sometimes enough for three or four teams.         \n\n\u201cWe had some girls that were very good,\u201d Rivera said, \u201cbetter than some of the guys.\u201d         \n\nIf their free time coincided with high tide, they would repair to a dirt road next to the beach. The space was more cramped, with water on one side and tall grass on the other, and to avoid losing the ball they learned to hit it straight up the road. But on the beach, there were no such restrictions, although seashells could wreak havoc on bare feet.         \n\n\u201cThat was a normal problem,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cYou cut it and hope it wasn\u2019t too bad.\u201d         \n\nThe worst injury that Rivera recalled came on a day they were playing soccer, when he and his brother went up for the ball and banged heads. Rivera sustained a nasty cut over an eye. His brother had what could have been a concussion; he was vomiting in the hospital, where they both ended up that day.         \n\nAs he became better at baseball and played on organized teams, Rivera found his way onto real baseball fields nearby. But, he said, he remained a fixture on that beach until he was signed by the  \n as an amateur free agent in 1990 at age 20.         \n\nRivera also helped his father on the fishing boats, but he knew that kind of work was not for him.         \n\n\u201cIt is a tough job,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want that kind of life.\u201d         \n\nStill, like all the children in his town, Rivera understood the business. He knew that even if the incoming tide meant an end to the baseball and soccer games on the beach, it was good for fishermen like his father, because it lifted their boats out to sea.         \n\nBefore a recent game, Rivera was asked if he felt that a different kind of tide was coming in on him now, ending his baseball games for good. After 19 years of baseball glory, it is time for the Sandman to go. But that also means it is time for other things in his life, time for his family and the church that he says will define his life in retirement.         \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good way to present it,\u201d Rivera said, his famous smile illuminating his face. \u201cWe used to hate it when the tide came in. It\u2019s good for the boats and the fishermen. Maybe it\u2019s good for me, too. The tide coming in is good for all the things in life, except for playing baseball.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/26/sports/baseball/the-boyhood-tides-that-formed-baseballs-sandman.html", "date": "2013-09-25", "description": "The best playing surface in Puerto Caimito, Panama \u2014 Yankees closer Mariano Rivera\u2019s boyhood village \u2014 was the hard, white sand that revealed itself at low tide."}
