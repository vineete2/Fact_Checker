{"headline": "Los Angeles: Goat-Stew City, U.S.A.", "body": "\nEveryone with Internet access is a critic, but some forms of amateur criticism have higher standing than others. Amateur literary critics, like Dylan Lucia, an Amazon reviewer who gave one star to \u201cFahrenheit 451\u201d (\u201cBradbury is a good writer [I\u2019ll give him that], but I HATE his writing style\u201d), may lack a nuanced understanding of the English language; some amateur film critics, like the IMDB reviewer who gave 10 stars to \u201cWrath of the Titans\u201d (\u201ci never saw a movie this good before in my life\u201d), may have never seen another movie before in their lives. But all of us with a tongue and a functioning digestive tract are authorities on food. After all, we have a commanding range of experience to draw from: we eat, according to one study, an average of 4.9 times a day. When it comes to food, everyone is not just a critic \u2014 everyone is a connoisseur.         \n\nIn such a competitive field, how does the amateur food critic distinguish himself? There are popular review sites like Urbanspoon and Yelp, but they can be egalitarian to a fault. In New Orleans, for instance, Urbanspoon ranks Caf\u00e9 du Monde as the city\u2019s top restaurant; it may have the best beignets and chicory coffee (many natives will scoff even at this), but it serves little else. Yelp lists Joe\u2019s Falafel in Studio City as Los Angeles\u2019s best restaurant. (\u201cPita bread and Gyro is the way to go!!! Well done Joe\u2019s\u201d \u2014 Calvin K. from Marina del Rey.) The true culinary obsessives go elsewhere. They go to Chowhound.         \n\n \n is a swarming bazaar of a Web site, with videos, blogs, recipes and product reviews, but Chowhound, its discussion board, is its central square. Unlike its competitors, Chowhound is organized not by restaurant but by discussion topic. By default, the topics are listed chronologically, based on the most recent comment. If you go to the front page of Yelp or Urbanspoon, you will most likely see a listing of the top restaurants in your area. If you go to Chowhound, the headline instead might be \u201cBurmese in Boston?\u201d or \u201cDebrecen, Hungary \u2014 Regional Hajdu-Bihar specialties at Flaska Vendeglo.\u201d Casual readers will click away in confusion.         \n\nBut the site\u2019s chaos, intentional or not, serves a purpose: it weeds out the dilettantes. Only the most dedicated zealots will bother to penetrate the thicket of random subjects and digressive comments. And they will be rewarded. Reading Chowhound is like attending an academic conference at which specialists deliver papers on subjects as arcane, and various, as the best place to eat dim sum in Memphis or how to find blue masa flour in Melbourne.         \n\nAs I wrote this sentence, for instance, the Chowhound board included the following discussion topics:         \n\n\u201cCentral N.J. spots for good Pernil? lets talk pig.\u201d         \n\n\u201cCincinnati \u2014 Russian delis?\u201d         \n\n\u201cWhere do L.A.P.D. officers take their lunch break?\u201d         \n\n\u201cWisconsin Fish Boil Recommendations.\u201d         \n\nInevitably commenters materialize who claim authoritatively that Marina\u2019s International Deli is the only Russian deli in Cincinnati, that the best pernil in central New Jersey can be found at Ada\u2019s Latin Flavor in Long Branch and that L.A.P.D. officers prefer Manuel\u2019s Original El Tepeyac Cafe, Palermo Ristorante and the Denny\u2019s on Wilshire. Responses begin appearing within minutes, and they keep coming for years, long after the original poster\u2019s query has been satisfied. The most recent response to the \u201cWisconsin Fish Boil \u201d thread, for instance, was written by a user named brketo:         \n\n\u201cI grew up in Eau Claire, WI, and we did fish boils all the time. I moved to International Falls, MN, and live on the Canadian border, where I have continued to do the boils. We just did the 6th annual boil at the Sons of Norway Vinland Lodge last Sunday. . . . If you send me your e-mail I will send you pix of the boils and all details.\u201d         \n\nBrketo was responding to comments written more than  \n. The quest for Wisconsin\u2019s best fish boil, like the pursuit of any kind of higher knowledge, never ends.
