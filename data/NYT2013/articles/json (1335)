{"headline": "Discord Remains at Vatican as Pope Benedict Departs", "body": "\nVATICAN CITY \u2014 As the sun set on Rome and on his turbulent eight-year papacy,  \n, a shy theologian who never seemed entirely at home in the limelight, was whisked by helicopter into retirement on Thursday.         \n\nBut while Benedict, 85, retires to a life of prayer, study, walks in the garden and piano practice, he leaves in his wake a  \n hierarchy facing scandals and intrigue that are casting a shadow over the cardinals entrusted with electing his successor in a conclave this month.         \n\nEven as he met with the cardinals on his final day as pope, pledging \u201cunconditional reverence and obedience\u201d to his successor and urging the cardinals to \u201cwork like an orchestra\u201d harmonizing for the good of the church, the discord was apparent.         \n\nOn Thursday, the Vatican confirmed reports that it had ordered wiretaps on the phones of some Vatican officials as part of a leaks investigation. Other cardinals were increasingly outspoken about the crisis of governance during Benedict\u2019s papacy.         \n\nThat failing is expected to be much in the cardinals\u2019 minds as they begin meeting informally on Monday to discuss the state of the papacy and determine when to start the conclave, which could be as soon as next week. Earlier this week, Benedict changed church law to allow the cardinals to start the conclave before the traditional 15-day waiting period after the papacy is vacant.         \n\nIn his final blessing to the faithful, who gathered outside the papal summer residence in Castel Gandolfo where he will live for several months, Benedict appeared tired, and even relieved, saying that from now on \u201cI am simply a pilgrim beginning the last leg of his pilgrimage on this earth.\u201d         \n\nHis towering predecessor, John Paul II, wasted away with Parkinson\u2019s disease; Benedict, whose life\u2019s work was aimed at reconciling faith and reason, opted for a short farewell.         \n\n\u201cGood night, and thank you,\u201d he said in Italian to the boisterous but small crowds at Castel Gandolfo, just over two weeks after he shocked the world on Feb. 11 by announcing his retirement, the first in the modern history of the church.         \n\nEarlier, thousands of people stood in a hushed St. Peter\u2019s Square, forming half-moon crowds around giant video screens showing the pope\u2019s departure as seagulls wheeled in the waning light. Many looked up and waved as his helicopter circled the square. \u201cViva il Papa!\u201d several shouted. One banner read simply \u201cDanke!!!\u201d         \n\nKatie Martin, 29, an aspiring firefighter from Manhattan Beach, Calif., said she delayed her visit to Rome by a week to witness the historic event. \u201cI love my faith,\u201d she said. \u201cI love my church. I have a great love for the Holy Father.\u201d         \n\nLike many, Ms. Martin said she was sad to see Benedict\u2019s papacy end. \u201cBut I\u2019m also really excited to see what\u2019s next,\u201d she said.         \n\nIn many ways, Benedict never seemed to fit into his red shoes. He seemed uninterested in the spectacle of power, awkward even raising his arms to greet crowds, forever disappointing photographers. On a 2009 visit to the Holy Land, he did not stop at the muddy pool in the Jordan River where Jesus is believed to have been baptized, passing by on a golf cart instead.         \n\nHis critics say that on his watch, the Vatican suffered a profound crisis of governance. On Thursday, Panorama magazine reported that the Vatican secretariat of state had ordered wiretaps on the phones of several Vatican prelates as part of an investigation into the scandal in which confidential documents were leaked to the news media and the author of a tell-all book.         \n\nThe Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, said Thursday that magistrates of the Vatican \u201cmight have authorized some wiretaps or some checks,\u201d but nothing on a significant scale.         \n\nVatican watchers say the wiretapping was a shocking breach of trust and an indication of the high levels of distrust since the leaks scandal. But Father Lombardi dismissed that. The idea of \u201can investigation that creates an atmosphere of fear of mistrust that will now affect the conclave has no foundation in reality,\u201d he said.         \n\nEarlier this week, he said the pope had decided that a dossier on the leaks affair compiled by three cardinals would be shown only to the next pope.\u00a0        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/01/world/europe/pope-benedict-xvi.html", "date": "2013-02-28", "description": "As the sun set on Rome and on his turbulent eight-year papacy, Pope Benedict XVI, a shy theologian who never seemed fully at home in the limelight, was whisked by helicopter into retirement."}
