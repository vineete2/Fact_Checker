{"headline": "Charity Program Operated by Students at Risk", "body": "\nThis is a tale of good deeds gone unrequited. And of city officials unable to nourish the good fortune they find in their midst.         \n\nI\u2019m getting ahead of myself, however.         \n\nLet\u2019s walk into Public School 19, a brick fort of a school that sits alongside a hillside road in West Brighton on Staten Island.         \n\nJeanne Raleigh, 50, who greets me at the door, vibrates like a tuning fork. Sardonic, passionate and funny all at once, she teaches fourth grade. She also runs the Penny Harvest for this school, made up of working-class Yemenis and Mexicans, Ecuadoreans and Sri Lankans.         \n\nEach year, P.S. 19\u2019s children collect piles and piles of pennies, plopping them in buckets. Then Ms. Raleigh convenes her executive team (which is to say 15 fourth and fifth graders) and the team telephones the C.E.O.\u2019s of foster care agencies and pediatric wards and interviews them. The committee picks finalists and the student body votes. Then the children hand over their great haul \u2014 $2,243 last year \u2014 and give scholarships to foster care children, and Xboxes to cancer wards.         \n\n\u201cI wanted to show the kids, \u2018Hey, you can make a difference in this world!\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ms. Raleigh says in a voice that slides sideways on the intonations of her native Bronx. \u201cThese kids become our ambassadors, and it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d         \n\nIt could all end in the next few weeks. Common Cents, the little nonprofit group that runs the city\u2019s grand penny harvest, is near death.         \n\nShould Common Cents fail to make its payroll and close, 721 city schools, public and private, will lose one of the nation\u2019s most innovative service programs for elementary school children. An autopsy surely will point to the city  \n as complicit in its death.         \n\nAlthough they deny it now, school officials two years ago cut a sort of deal with Teddy Gross, the founder and executive director of Common Cents. United Healthcare had donated $2 million to the September 11 Memorial Museum and given memorial pins to schoolchildren. In addition, the schools chancellor,  \n, promised that 1.3 million schoolchildren would each donate a penny to the Sept. 11 effort.         \n\nMr. Walcott\u2019s offer caught his own officials unaware. So Gregg Bethiel, who handled such matters for the department, made a de facto deal with Mr. Gross. If Common Cents rallied and ran an innovative program to help tens of thousands of children commemorate the anniversary of Sept. 11, 2001, the Education Department would cover the program\u2019s costs \u2014 $200,000.         \n\nEducation officials also held out the promise that they would find another $200,000 for Common Cents, which had seen its philanthropic aid drop sharply after the recession.         \n\nCommon Cents delivered gloriously. They helped drive discussions and reflections in hundreds of schools, and distributed a department curriculum specifically designed to help teachers talk about Sept. 11 with students. One result\u00a0of those efforts,\u00a0\u201cThe 9.12 Book,\u201d\u00a0is unavoidably moving.         \n\nAnd about those pennies? Students collected 20 tons of coins, or to be exact, $60,611.32 \u2014 well beyond the $13,000 Mr. Walcott had promised.         \n\n\u201cIt informed everything we did for that year,\u201d Mr. Gross says.         \n\nThe Education Department delivered not much in return. It paid Common Cents, but not until January 2013, long after the work was done.         \n\nAs to the other $200,000 needed to see Common Cents through its rough patch?         \n\n\u201cWe worked hard to deliver a $200,000 contract,\u201d a schools spokeswoman, Erin Hughes, noted in an e-mail statement Monday. \u201cBut we made no financial commitments \u2014 and signed no contracts \u2014 beyond that.\u201d         \n\nThe suggestion, she added, that the city \u201csomehow owes his charity hundreds of thousands of dollars is wrong and does not stand up to scrutiny.\u201d         \n\nLet\u2019s scrutinize those claims.         \n\nEarlier on Monday, the Education Department put an official on the telephone. This official insisted on anonymity out of concern that he might otherwise have to speak ill of Mr. Gross. This official suggested that Mr. Gross had either misunderstood the department or been distracted at the time. It\u2019s a pity, this official said, but this \u201cstruggling charity\u201d simply could not attract enough philanthropic support.         \n\nPerhaps Mr. Gross deserves some blame for being a na\u00eff; he didn\u2019t memorialize the department\u2019s commitments with a written letter and a signature.         \n\nBut here is the rub: Taped conversations back up Mr. Gross\u2019s account. Mr. Bethiel can be heard saying, in February 2012, that he would provide $200,000 and that the city\u2019s nonprofit arm would try to deliver another $200,000 \u201cin the next year.\u201d         \n\nOn these tapes, Mr. Bethiel makes no secret of his appreciation. He can be heard choking back tears as he told Mr. Gross: \u201cAgain, let me say thank you. Last year was a really bad year for us. There were screw-ups all along the way.\u201d         \n\nWere Common Cents to disappear, he told Mr. Gross, \u201cwe would lose two-thirds of our in-service numbers.\u201d         \n\nA wiry man with dark eyes that probe as a doctor would with a scalpel, Mr. Gross is a playwright when he is not running his nonprofit group. He comes to this public airing reluctantly. He liked Mr. Bethiel, and perhaps more to the point, he trusted him. \u201cThe betrayals become more sour and more sorry,\u201d he says softly.         \n\nBack on Staten Island, these politics can sound distant. Except that Ms. Raleigh leans so powerfully on this program.         \n\n\u201cLast year, one of our fourth graders, a foster child herself, went to the awards dinner where we gave a Penny Harvest scholarship to a foster care agency. She wore a dress and looked so, so beautiful.\u201d         \n\nShe catches herself and starts again: \u201cThis is how we give meaning to lives. I\u2019m very lucky that this program exists.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/01/nyregion/charity-program-operated-by-students-at-risk.html", "date": "2013-09-30", "description": "The Penny Harvest program, in which children collect pennies to help others, may end if the nonprofit group that runs it has to close."}
