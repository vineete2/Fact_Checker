{"headline": "Paula Deen\u2019s Cook Tells of Slights, Steeped in History", "body": "\nSAVANNAH, Ga. \u2014 Dora Charles and Paula Deen were soul sisters. That\u2019s what Ms. Deen called the black cook from the start, even before the books and the television shows and the millions of dollars.         \n\nFor 22 years, Mrs. Charles was the queen of the Deen kitchens. She helped open the Lady & Sons, the restaurant here that made Ms. Deen\u2019s career. She developed recipes, trained other cooks and made sure everything down to the collard greens tasted right.         \n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s a Southern dish,\u201d Ms. Deen once said, \u201cyou better not put it out unless it passes this woman\u2019s tongue.\u201d         \n\nThe money was not great. Mrs. Charles spent years making less than $10 an hour, even after Ms. Deen became a Food Network star. And there were tough moments. She said Ms. Deen used racial slurs. Once she wanted Mrs. Charles to ring a dinner bell in front of the restaurant, hollering for people to come and get it.         \n\n\u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m not ringing no bell,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mrs. Charles said. \u201cThat\u2019s a symbol to me of what we used to do back in the day.\u201d         \n\nFor a black woman in Savannah with a ninth-grade education, though, it was good steady work. And Ms. Deen, she said, held out the promise that together, they might get rich one day.         \n\nNow, Ms. Deen, 66, is fighting empire-crushing accusations of racism, and Mrs. Charles, 59 and nursing a bad shoulder, lives in an aging trailer home on the outskirts of Savannah.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just time that everybody knows that Paula Deen don\u2019t treat me the way they think she treat me,\u201d she said.         \n\nThe relationship between Mrs. Charles and Ms. Deen is a complex one, laced with history and deep affection, whose roots can be traced back to the antebellum South. Depending on whether Mrs. Charles or Ms. Deen tells the story, it illustrates lives of racial inequity or benevolence.         \n\nJessica B. Harris, a culinary scholar whose books have explored the role of Africans in the Southern kitchen, said Ms. Deen and Mrs. Charles are characters in a story that has been played out since slaves started cooking for whites. \u201cPeering through the window of someone else\u2019s success when you have been instrumental in creating that success is not a good feeling,\u201d Ms. Harris said. \u201cThink about who made money from the blues.\u201d         \n\nMs. Deen ran a restaurant in a Best Western hotel when Mrs. Charles, newly divorced and tired of fast-food kitchens, walked in and auditioned by cooking her version of Southern food. Ms. Deen hired her immediately.         \n\nTheir birthdays are a day apart, so they celebrated together. When Ms. Deen catered parties to survive until they could open the Lady & Sons, Mrs. Charles hustled right beside her.         \n\n\u201cIf I lost Dora, I would have been devastated,\u201d Ms. Deen wrote in her 2007 memoir, \u201cIt Ain\u2019t All About the Cooking.\u201d         \n\nEarly on, Mrs. Charles claims, Ms. Deen made her a deal: \u201cStick with me, Dora, and I promise you one day if I get rich you\u2019ll get rich.\u201d         \n\nNow, Mrs. Charles said, she wished she had gotten that in writing. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I had to \u2019cause we were real close back then,\u201d she said.         \n\nThat is where the two women\u2019s stories diverge. Ms. Deen, through her publicity team, offered a statement denying all of Mrs. Charles\u2019s accusations: \u201cFundamentally Dora\u2019s complaint is not about race but about money. It is about an employee that despite over 20 years of generosity feels that she still deserves yet even more financial support from Paula Deen. \u201d         \n\nWhat is more, the document states, Ms. Deen \u201cprovided guidance and support through the many ups and downs of Mrs. Charles\u2019s life.\u201d         \n\nInvestigators for the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson\u2019s Rainbow PUSH Coalition have spoken to Mrs. Charles. Robert Patillo, a lawyer for the coalition, visited Savannah in June and July to interview Ms. Deen\u2019s restaurant employees, including Mrs. Charles, who still works at the Lady & Sons.
