{"headline": "As Renters Move In, Some Homeowners Fret", "body": "\nMEMPHIS \u2014 Beneath the spreading shade tree in Laura Holcomb\u2019s front yard, there are some 70 varieties of hosta, stands of elephant ear and a Japanese maple. For the 17 years she has owned the brick house on Rose Trail Drive in the Hillshire subdivision, Ms. Holcomb has devoted herself to her home and garden.         \n\nAcross the street, Carl Osborne and his family have been tenants for two years, moving in after the previous owner lost the house in a foreclosure. They are happy to have a decent place to call home but, like many renters, they have not done much to improve the appearance or join the community.         \n\nThey are not alone: the family behind Ms. Holcomb, the one two doors down, and several in the cul-de-sac across the way are among the renters who have been supplanting homeowners in this blue-collar, suburban neighborhood as investors buy single-family homes and convert them to rentals.         \n\n\u201cUsed to, we knew our neighbors,\u201d Ms. Holcomb said. Then she gestured toward the few remaining owner-occupied houses nearby. \u201cExcept for the two that have been here, I don\u2019t know any of my neighbors.\u201d         \n\nAcross the country, a growing number of single-family rentals provide an option for many who lost their homes in the housing crash through foreclosure and for those who cannot obtain a mortgage under today\u2019s tougher credit conditions. But the decline in homeownership is also changing many neighborhoods in profound ways, including reduced home values, lower voter turnout and political influence, less social stability and higher crime.         \n\n\u201cWhen there are fewer homeowners, there is less \u2018self-help,\u2019 like park and neighborhood cleanup, neighborhood watch,\u201d said William M. Rohe, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who has just completed  \n on homeownership\u2019s effects.         \n\nEven conscientious landlords and tenants invest less in their property than owner-occupants, he said. \u201cWho\u2019s going to paint the outside of a rental house? You\u2019d almost have to be crazy.\u201d         \n\nDespite signs of a recovery in the housing market, the country\u2019s homeownership rate is still on the decline. In Memphis, it has fallen from roughly 65 percent of families in 2005 to about 55 percent now, according to the Census Bureau.         \n\nIn hundreds of neighborhoods that once attracted first-time home buyers,  \n, buying up tens of thousands of homes for the rental market.         \n\nThat has helped put paying tenants in a number of homes that were vacant or becoming eyesores. And many of the new tenants say they are eager to buy a home at the first opportunity and share the same concerns as homeowners about maintaining a safe and healthy neighborhood for their families and children.         \n\nBut it has also raised the ire of some homeowners whose tidy subdivisions have changed, seemingly overnight, into a parade of strangers.         \n\nHillshire was built in the late 1970s, its single-story, three-bedroom homes designed with no particular architectural pedigree, but not ticky-tacky identical. As a young mother of two, Ms. Holcomb, a medical practice administrator, chose the neighborhood because of its school district, paying $73,000 for her home in 1996.         \n\nThe homeowners interviewed for this article tended to have steady middle-class incomes; several were retired military and police officers. Among the renters, who pay about $900 to $1,000 a month, were several construction and restaurant workers, with lower, less reliable earnings.         \n\nOn a recent evening, parents pushed strollers and lawn mowers droned, children played on a tire swing and in one driveway, a longtime resident and his grandson tinkered with the fat tire of a slick red drag racer.         \n\nBut there was a seedy underside. Jimmy Fumich, a homeowner and air-conditioner repairman, said he had been in court that day as a witness in an animal cruelty case against a neighbor, a renter, who had left a dog chained to a stop sign in the heat. She was already in trouble, he said, for breaking into an empty house on the block.         \n\nMr. Fumich, who is Ms. Holcomb\u2019s brother, mentioned a couple of meth houses and one that had been used as a brothel. All were rentals. Police department records show that major crime in the area, which does not include drug offenses, has actually gone down since spiking in 2010.         \n\nStill, Lea Ann Braswell, the captain of the neighborhood watch, recounted a  \n in which a teenage girl, whose throat police said was cut by a young man carrying a sword, sought refuge on Ms. Braswell\u2019s doorstep.         \n\n\u201cWe used to have hardly anything happen,\u201d she said.         \n\nAsked how many renters were active with the neighborhood watch, Mr. Fumich said, \u201cZero.\u201d         \n\nWhat is watchful to some, however, can feel intrusive to others. In the Osbornes\u2019 home, one resident who keeps a close eye on things is referred to as \u201cNosy Neighbor.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/29/business/economy/as-renters-move-in-and-neighborhoods-change-homeowners-grumble.html", "date": "2013-08-28", "description": "Some homeowners worry about the changing makeup of their neighborhoods, as they fill with tenants who have little investment in the area."}
