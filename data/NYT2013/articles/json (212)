{"headline": "Neymar, Barcelona\u2019s New Idol, Pledges Allegiance to Messi", "body": "\nBARCELONA, Spain \u2014 His arrival was orchestrated as if he were some blend of rock star and head of state, a 21-year-old object of adoration flown in from Brazil to the delight of more than 50,000 people at the Camp Nou stadium.         \n\nThe fans were anxious to see their new idol, an ascendant Brazilian talent whose task is simple: flourish as a member of one of the greatest soccer clubs in the world.         \n\nNeymar, one of the sport\u2019s biggest stars, arrived on Monday at  \n, the sport\u2019s most successful club over the past decade. It was the culmination of a two-year, cross-continent, will-he-or-won\u2019t-he drama.         \n\nBarcelona said it had paid about $74 million to Neymar\u2019s former club,  \n, and other companies that held portions of his rights.         \n\nBarcelona declined to say how much it would pay Neymar, whose full name is Neymar da Silva Santos Jr., but that he had agreed to a five-year contract.         \n\nNeymar did his part Monday by saying all the right things to a crowd of fans who might be wondering whether his play will collide or jell with that of  \n, the club\u2019s four-time world player of the year. Neymar ventured a few words in Catalan before swearing his allegiance, in Portuguese, to Messi.         \n\n\u201cI want to help Messi continue to be the best player in the world,\u201d Neymar said to resounding cheers.         \n\nHe also juggled the ball 71 times and did a lap around the stadium, stopping to pick up balls and kick them into the stands.         \n\nNeymar\u2019s signing, and his arrival, were the result of \u201clong, hard negotiations\u201d stretching back two years, said the Barcelona vice president Josep Maria Bartomeu.  \n as a possible successor to Pel\u00e9 as Brazil\u2019s greatest player, had held off suitors from Europe for at least that long, as his father and Santos insisted it was not time for the thin, rhythmic player to leave his homeland.         \n\nSpeculation continued, however, coming to a head in recent weeks as the Spanish rivals Barcelona and Real Madrid made offers. Barcelona won, even though it reportedly offered much less than Real Madrid, after Neymar \u201ctalked with God\u201d and \u201cmade a decision with my heart.\u201d         \n\nNeymar took the 12-hour flight to Barcelona after playing a full 90 minutes in  \n on Sunday afternoon in Rio de Janeiro. He was scheduled to quickly return to Brazil to join the national team for the  \n, a dress rehearsal next year\u2019s World Cup.         \n\nNeymar\u2019s brief time in Barcelona included a photo session, a medical checkup, a contract signing ceremony, another photo session, his first public appearance at the Camp Nou, and finally the news conference.         \n\nFielding questions in Portuguese, English, Spanish and Catalan, Neymar, flanked by Bartomeu and the club\u2019s technical director, Andoni Zubizarreta, appeared relaxed and at times emotional.         \n\nHe spoke of the Brazilian players he had watched play for Barcelona when he was younger, including Ronaldinho, who was named world player of the year twice. Stepping onto the club\u2019s famed field, he said, he \u201chad to fight back tears.\u201d Signing with Bar\u00e7a, he added, \u201cwas the dream of a child who always wanted to achieve this.\u201d         \n\nAsked if he hoped to enter the ranks of the world\u2019s best players, he echoed his earlier words before the Camp Nou faithful: \u201cI\u2019ve never worried about that. The best player is already here. He\u2019s Messi.\u201d         \n\nNeymar also said he had not yet considered what number his jersey would bear \u2014 the young midfielder Thiago wore Neymar\u2019s customary No. 11 for Barcelona last season \u2014 or what position he would play.         \n\nAnd he said he had not decided to sign with Barcelona for money alone, given that Real Madrid offered more.         \n\n\u201cWe made the decision as a family,\u201d he said, \u201cand we\u2019ve never been moved by money.\u201d         \n\nHe reminded the world\u2019s news media that he had been courted for years by European clubs, but had elected to stay in Brazil.         \n\n\u201cI have to be happy where I\u2019m playing,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore I play, my father has always asked me, \u2018Are you happy?\u2019 And I feel that I\u2019ll be happy with Bar\u00e7a.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/sports/soccer/barcelona-gives-big-hug-to-its-new-idol-neymar.html", "date": "2013-06-04", "description": "The Brazilian striker Neymar was greeted like a rock star in Barcelona and pledged his allegiance to an idol already there, Lionel Messi."}
