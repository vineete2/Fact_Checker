But Matt is so in touch with his feminine side that \u201cMad Men\u201d doesn\u2019t really feel as if it\u2019s run by a man. There are lots of boys and sexism, but you\u2019ve got these three female leads who are really complex.         \n\n \n  \nIt\u2019s a side of humanity, but just a side. These particular guys are not very great representations of the male sex, I would say.         \n\n \n  \nYes, I am.         \n\n \n  \n Well, let me just grab my scripts.         \n\n \n  \nThere\u2019s 200 people in our crew, and they don\u2019t say a word, because they love the show and they don\u2019t want to ruin it.         \n\n \n  \nAnd a little bit of fear.         \n\n \n  \nI hope not. Anyone who sleeps with Don does not have a long road ahead of them. It\u2019s like the kiss of death to sleep with Don. I really think it would be jumping the shark to do that.         \n\n \n  \nShe is supercool. We grew up around music and listening to the blues station in Chicago and knowing who James Cotton was. She\u2019d be practicing in the car taking my brother to baseball or me to ballet.         \n\n \nI wasn\u2019t making breadwinner money, but my mom stressed financial independence. I moved to New York when I was 19 and was very, very independent.         \n\n \n  \nIt doesn\u2019t bother me, but I don\u2019t want to talk about it. For me, you gotta make up your own mind about anything in your life, whether it\u2019s a relationship or a job or religion \u2014 or Pilates.         \n\n \n  \nThank you.         \n\n \n  \nOh, God. I learned so much. Not to be at all Oprah on you, but it is one of those things where you are kind of glad to have learned those lessons at an early age \u2014 to get them out of the way.         \n\n \n\nI have no idea. It played for like five years off and on. It was a good ad and a good performance, but if the person becomes recognizable, I would think that would work against you, because you want a normal person.         \n\n \n  \nI\u2019m sure Peggy would get lots of headaches, yeah. Are you kidding? Both physical and emotional \u2014 but I think that Peggy also would have thought that was a great ad.
