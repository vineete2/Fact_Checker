But Shanti Kumar, a senior at the Bronx High School of Science, went ahead anyway when the university prompted her to react in writing to the idea of \u201cPrinceton in the nation\u2019s service and in the service of all nations.\u201d         \n\nBack in January, when  \n high school seniors to send in college application essays about money, class, working and the economy, I wasn\u2019t sure what, if anything, would come in over the transom.         \n\nBut 66 students submitted essays, and with the help of Harry Bauld, the author of \u201c \n,\u201d we\u2019ve selected four to publish  \n and in part in this column. That allowed us to be slightly more selective than Princeton itself was last year.         \n\nWhat these four writers have in common is an appetite for risk. Not only did they talk openly about issues that are emotionally complex and often outright taboo, but they took brave and counterintuitive positions on class, national identity and the application process itself. For anyone looking to inspire their own children or grandchildren who are seeking to go to college in the fall of 2014, these four essays would be a good place to start.         \n\nPerhaps the most daring essay of all came from Julian Cranberg, a 17-year-old from Brookline, Mass. One of the first rules of the college admissions process is that you don\u2019t write about the college admissions process.         \n\nBut Mr. Cranberg thumbed his nose at that convention, taking on the tremendous cost of the piles of mail schools send to potential students, and the waste that results from the effort. He figured that he received at least $200 worth of pitches in the past year or so.         \n\n\u201cWhy, in an era of record-high  \n debt and unemployment, are colleges not reallocating these ludicrous funds to aid their own students instead of extending their arms far and wide to students they have never met?\u201d he asked in the essay.         \n\nAntioch College seemed to think that was a perfectly reasonable question and accepted him, though he will attend Oberlin College instead, to which he did not submit the essay.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bold move to critique the very institution he was applying to,\u201d said Mr. Bauld, who also teaches English at Horace Mann School in New York City. \u201cBut here\u2019s somebody who knows he can make it work with intelligence and humor.\u201d         \n\nIndeed, Mr. Cranberg\u2019s essay includes asides about applicants\u2019 gullibility and the college that sent him a DHL \u201cpriority\u201d envelope, noting inside that he was a priority to the college. \u201cThe humor here is not in the jokes,\u201d Mr. Bauld added. \u201cIt originates in a critical habit of mind, and the kind of mind that is in this essay is going to play out extremely well in any class that he\u2019s in.\u201d         \n\nAdmissions professionals often warn people not to think that they can write their way into the freshman class. \u201cThe essay is one document that, even in the best of circumstances, is written by an individual telling one story,\u201d said Shawn Abbott, the assistant vice president for undergraduate admissions at New York University. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that any one writing sample should trump what they did over four years.\u201d         \n\nStill, he acknowledged that his staff had been taken with the story told by Lyle Li, a 19-year-old Brooklyn resident who applied this year. He wrote about his family\u2019s restaurant and his mother, an immigrant from China who once wanted to be a doctor and now works behind a cash register.         \n\n\u201cWhen I visit my friends, I see the names of elite institutions adorning the living room walls,\u201d wrote Mr. Li, a senior at Regis High School in Manhattan. \u201cI am conscious that these framed diplomas are testaments to the hard work and accomplishments of my friends\u2019 parents and siblings. Nevertheless, the sight of them was an irritating reminder of the disparity between our households. I was not the upper-middle-class kid on Park Avenue. Truth be told, I am just some kid from Brooklyn. Instead of diplomas and accolades, my parents\u2019 room emits a smell from the restaurant uniforms they wear seven days a week, all year round.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/18/your-money/four-college-essays-that-stand-out-from-the-crowd.html", "date": "2013-05-17", "description": "Young writers show an appetite for risk in college application essays about money, class and the economy, submitted at a columnist\u2019s invitation."}
