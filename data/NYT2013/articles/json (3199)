{"headline": "Where the Buck Stops, Some See a Bystander", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014  \n finds himself under fire on two disparate fronts these days, both for the botched rollout of his signature health care program and for the secret spying on allied heads of state. In both instances, his explanation roughly boils down to this: I didn\u2019t know.         \n\nAs a practical matter, no president can be aware of everything going on in the sprawling government he theoretically manages. But as a matter of politics, Mr. Obama\u2019s plea of ignorance may do less to deflect blame than to prompt new questions about just how much in charge he really is.         \n\nIn recent days, the president\u2019s health and human services secretary said that despite internal concerns and a failed test run Mr. Obama was not told about serious problems with the new program\u2019s website until it was rolled out this month. Other officials said the president was not aware that the  \n was tapping the phone of Chancellor  \n of Germany and other friendly leaders until this summer, although intelligence officials said Tuesday that others in the White House had known.         \n\nOpposition lawmakers and pundits have seized on the White House explanations to accuse Mr. Obama of being a \u201cbystander president,\u201d as the Republican National Committee put it. Even some Democrats are scratching their heads at the seeming detachment from significant matters. MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d ran a montage of clips showing Mr. Obama or his aides disclaiming presidential knowledge of various issues as well as a graphic titled \u201cImplausible Deniability.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIt seems to me there\u2019s a pattern here \u2014 with any bad news coming out of the administration, the excuse is the president just didn\u2019t know about it,\u201d said Representative Adam Kinzinger, Republican of Illinois.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a point at which the I-didn\u2019t-know excuse really violates the idea of the buck stops here,\u201d he added. \u201cWe want to have a feeling that the president ultimately takes responsibility. The American people want to know they have a president who\u2019s in control and in charge.\u201d         \n\nDemocrats were less likely to blame the president but suggested that he was ill served if other officials did not keep him fully abreast. \u201cIf people really knew there were to be problems, I was a little surprised that people at the highest levels weren\u2019t aware,\u201d Patrick Griffin, who was a top White House official under President Bill Clinton, said of the health care program.         \n\nAs for the N.S.A. surveillance, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the Democrat who leads the Senate Intelligence Committee, put it sharply in a statement she released earlier this week. \u201cIt is my understanding that President Obama was not aware Chancellor Merkel\u2019s communications were being collected since 2002,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is a big problem.\u201d         \n\nAides dismissed suggestions that Mr. Obama did not pay enough attention in either of these areas. On the spying program, they said the president was deeply immersed in details of the nation\u2019s surveillance practices but was focused on those areas that constituted the major threats to the United States. He had no reason to suspect that Ms. Merkel or other leaders of close allies were being tapped, nor did he think to grill anyone about it because that was not a high priority, they said.         \n\n\u00a0 \u00a0On\u00a0health care, aides said that Mr. Obama had been fixated on details of the law\u2019s carrying out and that advisers did not withhold information but were likewise surprised by the scope of the problems.         \n\n\u00a0 \u201cFrom the moment the health care bill was signed into law the president was very focused on making sure it was implemented correctly,\u201d said Dan Pfeiffer, a senior White House adviser. \u201cIn just about every meeting, he pushed the team on whether the website was going to work. Unfortunately, it did not, and he\u2019s very frustrated.\u201d         \n\nMr. Pfeiffer insisted that the president wants to hear what he needs to hear and would not accept advisers\u2019 keeping negative information from him. \u201cHe\u2019ll know if you don\u2019t tell him the bad news he needs to hear, and that\u2019s the quickest way to be on the outside looking in,\u201d Mr. Pfeiffer said.         \n\nThe challenge for any president is keeping on top of a vast array of issues, any one of which could blow up at any given time. Harry S. Truman spoke for many of his successors when he said that \u201cthe pressures and complexities of the presidency have grown to a state where they are almost too much for one man to endure.\u201d And that was decades before metadata technology came along.
