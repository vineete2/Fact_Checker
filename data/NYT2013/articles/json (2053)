Who needs a roadside phone shop when you can now buy a cheap cellphone and call from anywhere you want?         \n\nThe list of soon-to-be obsolete professions is growing: The typewriter clerks who sit outside courthouses and government offices are losing ground to computers and email. The mimeograph machines and a whole neighborhood of men who manually carve rubber stamps are being replaced by laser printers, scanners and photocopiers.         \n\nIn every society, professions disappear in the name of progress. But the pace of change in Myanmar, where army generals introduced a form of democracy two years ago, has been compressed into months, not decades.         \n\n\u201cThe typewriting business is bad,\u201d said Daw Nwe Sanda, who was at an outdoor shop in Yangon, where the clack-clack-clack of manual typewriters fills the air. \u201cWe still have our regular customers. But someday computers will replace all of this.\u201d         \n\nMyanmar today feels caught between centuries. A clerk next to Ms. Nwe Sanda paused at her typewriter, picked up her smartphone and browsed Facebook.         \n\nShiny new cars pass her stall, which sits in front of a moss-covered, five-story British colonial building that is so dilapidated that large plants grow out of cracks in the facade.         \n\nTo tourists who hail from more orderly, sanitized societies, Myanmar\u2019s street life can be charming.         \n\nOn the sidewalks of Yangon, radishes are shredded, corn is steamed, coconuts are hollowed out and stalks of sugar cane are crushed into juice. Vendors sell knickknacks. On one stretch of sidewalk, they hawk teacups, used knives, Chinese-made plastic toys, two types of rat poison and a large pile of dusty, secondhand TV remote controls.         \n\nThe streets are cacophonous, crowded and colorful. But the charm is lost on some here. It is more like desperation, said U Say Thu, who has made rubber stamps on a Yangon street corner for the past decade.         \n\n\u201cNo one would choose to work on the roadside,\u201d said Mr. Say Thu, who tries to support his wife and children on an income of about $200 a month. \u201cWe would prefer to be indoors.\u201d         \n\nIt took him almost a year to master the art of hand-carving rubber stamps, which companies used for decades to give their correspondence an official imprimatur. But finding customers is getting harder, Mr. Say Thu said. He works with his back to a wall that is covered in green fungus across the street from Sule Pagoda, the golden Buddhist shrine in central Yangon.         \n\n\u201cMy profession is in danger,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to make ends meet.\u201d         \n\nA few blocks away is another trade that seems bound for obsolescence: the \u201cice water ladies\u201d who offer to quench the thirst of customers with a block of ice that drips through a sock into a pitcher of water. Two wrinkled women compete for business by clanging metal cups together. Their main threats, convenience stores that sell bottled water, are opening across the country.         \n\nLife in Yangon is moving indoors. Investors paved over a huge cemetery a few years ago and built Junction Square, a giant shopping mall.         \n\nOffice buildings and hotels are under construction across the city. Air-conditioned supermarkets carry delicacies like Roquefort cheese from France and apples from the United States.         \n\nOnce a relatively scarce luxury, air-conditioning is everywhere now, in the form of newly imported cars. After decades when buying a car was beyond the reach of all but the wealthy, the government has allowed a flood of imports.         \n\nA significant portion of Yangon\u2019s population now spends lots of time shielded from the tropical heat \u2014 in traffic jams.         \n\nThe new cars replaced what populated Myanmar\u2019s streets before the country opened up: decades-old Japanese-made cars held together by the ingenuity of mechanics who welded their own spare parts, and used needles and thread to repair torn engine hoses.         \n\nBut those resourceful mechanics can barely contain their bafflement as they stare under the hoods of the new cars, in which microprocessors control everything.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big problem,\u201d said U Zaw Ye Win, who last year helped open Engine Doctor Engineering, a company that trains old mechanics in the ways of modern autos. Four decades of advances in automotive technology have cascaded into the country over the past two years. Myanmar\u2019s mechanics, like grease-monkey Rip Van Winkles, are trying to grasp the finer points of computer diagnostics.         \n\nMr. Zaw Ye Win, who was trained to be a mechanical engineer, is a good example. He spent 12 years as a political prisoner for defying the military junta and was released during an amnesty in 2011. When he emerged from jail, he had never sent an email, owned a mobile phone or used a web browser, let alone Google. He has quickly caught up.         \n\n\u201cMany mechanics don\u2019t know how to use a laptop,\u201d he said. \u201cWe explain it slowly.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/20/world/asia/as-myanmar-modernizes-old-professions-go-the-way-of-the-typewriter.html", "date": "2013-11-19", "description": "Businesses are forced to adapt, or risk disappearing, in a country where the pace of change has been compressed into months, not decades."}
