{"headline": "Bankruptcy for Ailing Detroit, but Prosperity for Its Teams", "body": "\nDETROIT \u2014 In this bankrupt city where even keeping the streetlights on has proved a struggle, one industry has continued humming along at a multibillion-dollar clip: professional sports.         \n\nThe  \n, who are playing in the American League Championship Series, have one of the highest payrolls in baseball at $148 million. Their star first baseman makes $23 million a year. And in a city that is contracting, the Tigers are expanding \u2014 their payroll is up 38 percent from 2011. The Pistons spent about $80 million to sign two second-tier players this summer. The Lions\u2019 quarterback signed a three-year extension in July worth $53 million. And the pizza entrepreneur who owns the Tigers and the  \n plans to build an arena as part of a downtown development project partly supported by $285 million in public money.         \n\nDetroit\u2019s glittering sports teams operate in a different economy than does the rest of the city. Because of billionaire owners, lucrative television deals, dedicated fans and public subsidies, the city\u2019s teams have few of the problems that have dragged their hometown into the largest municipal bankruptcy filing in the nation\u2019s history.         \n\nBut that does not mean the yawning gap between the team\u2019s star-studded locker rooms and the city\u2019s boarded-up neighborhoods has no sting. A Lions defensive lineman has shrugged off more than $342,000 in fines and missed-game penalties \u2014 enough to pay the salaries of 10 rookie police officers.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of disposable cash around, but it\u2019s not intended for the right things or right people,\u201d said Amzie Griffin, a vendor at Comerica Park, the downtown baseball stadium. \u201cWe need jobs for the city people, for the black folk.\u201d         \n\nMr. Griffin, still working at 79, is one of many people here worried about household bills and dismayed at publicly financed stadiums and inflated player contracts.         \n\nWith gray hair peeking beneath his Tigers cap and bifocals balanced on his nose, Mr. Griffin occupies a rare perch in Detroit\u2019s sports world. For more than a half-century, he has sold everything from popcorn to pennants. He worked at old Tiger Stadium and is now at Comerica, a sparkling $300 million stadium that opened in 2000. The public shouldered more than a third of its costs.         \n\nLast week, as the Tigers played the Oakland Athletics in the American League playoffs, Mr. Griffin arrived at work three and half hours before the first pitch to put on his uniform, as he has done for decades. He sold Tigers jerseys and tiny bats to fans, a predominantly white crowd of 44,000, many of whom drove in from the suburbs and drove out again after the ninth inning.         \n\nMr. Griffin went to work last week ringing up merchandise, chatting with customers and sneaking peeks at the ballgame, but part of Detroit\u2019s municipal work force stayed home because of an enforced furlough. The mayor\u2019s office, the City Council, the Board of Ethics and the Finance Department\u2019s purchasing division were all shuttered for the first of two furlough days scheduled in October. Much of the rest of the city was just as quiet. Buses ran late or not at all. Whole acres of downtown streets were vacant. Young men stood idle on street corners.         \n\n\u201cI remember when we all took care of each other, instead of just our own,\u201d Mr. Griffin said, taking his place behind his souvenir stand.         \n\nHe calls himself a real Detroiter who knows his way around hardship, worked two jobs for much of his life and still lives in the heart of the city. His stadium job pays him on commission. Mr. Griffin is hardly the only one to notice the dissonance of pro sports in Detroit these days. The view looks just as strange from the batter\u2019s box as it does from the souvenir stand, according to members of the Tigers\u2019 organization.         \n\nAt a recent news conference, a reporter asked Detroit catcher Alex Avila if he felt guilty earning nearly $3 million a year. It was a question few other baseball players would have to field, but one that Mr. Avila sounded as if he was expecting.         \n\n\u201cWe definitely are aware of the situation of where we play,\u201d he said. \u201cOne thing that motivates us is that we want to be able to bring a championship to Detroit, a place that has longed for one.\u201d         \n\nHe added, \u201cWe feel we are a big part of the reason that people are coming back downtown.\u201d         \n\nJim Leyland, the Tigers\u2019 manager, was also asked about earning $2 million a year in a city where the poverty rate tops 40 percent.         \n\n\u201cI know how hard those people work, and it\u2019s a tough thing,\u201d he said.
