{"headline": "Player Ratings: Jamaica 1, U.S. 2", "body": "\nThree World Cup qualifiers without a defeat \u2014 two wins and a draw \u2014 with two home games to come. With a possible six points from those two (Panama and Honduras), the United States can probably book its reservations for Brazil. Seems like a long way from the angst and hand-wringing after the first game in the Hex, a loss at Honduras.         \n\nOne game at a time may be a clich\u00e9, but in qualifying it\u2019s a fact, even if a late goal for Jamaica nearly blew up a solid, if unspectacular effort.         \n\nFor the first time in 28 games as United States coach, Jurgen Klinsmann used the same lineup in consecutive games.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n Key punch in 17th minute after some lax defending. Frozen on line on Jamaica\u2019s tying goal. Otherwise, impeccable positioning.  \n         \n\n \n Jamaica\u2019s McCleary gave him a hard time in the first 25 minutes. Mostly stayed home on defense, playing out of position. Few forays forward were not memorable ... until he turned into the game\u2019s most unlikely hero, settling a short Michael Bradley corner, turning and burying a quick shot while falling back for the winner.  \n         \n\n \nWhere was he on Austin's shot off the post in the 38th? Top of the box. Got stronger as the game wore on. Still, a few too many cardiac moments. \n         \n\n \nSolid if unspectacular, not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that.  \n         \n\n \n Provided more offense than Dempsey in the first 45 ... from left back. Gives the U.S. speed on the flank, but still not convinced he has the size to ward off hefty forwards. Gets muscled off the ball too many times.  \n         \n\n \nAn elbow to the head ended his night in the 57th minute. Sprayed around some passes but often failed to close space in front of defenders that allowed Jamaicans, especially Austin, too much room to shoot or pass. Sustained a concussion and will probably miss Tuesday\u2019s game vs. Panama in Seattle. Who starts in his place? Kljestan perhaps?  \n         \n\n \nHit the post in second minute on shot from top of the box off a rebound. Some say he does not do much, but what he does is always productive. His smart, short corner led to the winning goal.  \n         \n\n \n Took on his man on the right flank and had inches to hit his cross for Jozy Altidore\u2019s opening goal. Late yellow card (he\u2019ll miss the Panama game) led to the tying goal after a late challenge. Stays wide, sees the whole field. But is he better than Landon Donovan? Stay tuned.  \n         \n\n \n Flitted in and out of the game, more out than in. The Reggae Boyz keyed on him and took every opportunity to body him and clip his heels. Can do better, much better.  \n         \n\n \n In first half, disappeared into the middle, but that gave Beasley room to roam on the left flank. Too many wasted passes.  \n         \n\n \n Goals or no goals, the young man seems to be oozing confidence. Buried his chance. What more could you want?  \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \nReplaced the injured Jones. Defender as a defensive midfielder. Not horrible. \n         \n\n \nReplaced Johnson in the 76th minute. Took a pass from Dempsey and tried to chip the keeper with Altidore unmarked. Decision-making still an issue.  \n         \n\n \nEntered for Altidore in the 84th. Lost his mark on Jamaica goal. \n         \n\n \n         \n\n \n Three points on the road in a place that has been most unkind in the past to United States teams. Has the team moving smartly toward Brazil. Took the hits after a weak performance against Belgium, supported his troops, then basked in a win over his native Germany. With two wins in coming games the summer\u2019s so bright he\u2019s going to need shades.  \n         \n\nHow did you rate the performance of the American players?
