{"headline": "Art Groups Fear Losing a Mayor, and His Money", "body": "\nHe has helped stage audacious outdoor art exhibitions and supported cultural groups through expansions and renovations \u2014 while quietly contributing hundreds of millions of dollars from his own personal fortune.         \n\nMayor Michael R. Bloomberg has been good to the arts in New York City, leaving a legacy that includes transformative projects like the BAM Cultural District and tourism-generating events like \u201cThe Gates,\u201d which adorned Central Park in 2005 with its billowing saffron-colored panels.         \n\nThere is, however, a problem: He\u2019s leaving.         \n\nWith less than six months remaining in Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s tenure, a cloud of unease has descended over arts executives, fund-raisers and artists. Over the last 12 years, they have grown accustomed to a City Hall that was receptive to their needs, as well as to a billionaire mayor who could privately bolster their budgets.         \n\nNow these organizations are facing two unknowns: Will a new mayor continue to support them? And, just as important, will Citizen Bloomberg?         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all very nervous,\u201d said Linda Shelton, the executive director of the Joyce Theater, which presents dance. \u201cWith Bloomberg, we all knew he was an arts mayor, that he understood what arts do for a neighborhood.\u201d         \n\nThat concern has grown acute as a two-year grant program from the mayor\u2019s private foundation, Bloomberg Philanthropies \u2014 which distributed $32 million to more than 250 arts groups in every borough \u2014 recently came to an end.         \n\nThe foundation has not announced whether it plans to continue making grants to a range of arts groups, leaving many organizations fearful that Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s priorities might shift to the national stage, given his support of issues like gun control and the environment.         \n\nPatricia E. Harris, who is simultaneously Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s first deputy mayor and the chief executive of his foundation, declined to address the future of the grants in a recent interview. Later, in a statement, she said the mayor has developed \u201can appreciation\u201d of smaller groups as good for neighborhoods and business activity.         \n\nMr. Bloomberg, a data-driven executive, has consistently made the case for the arts as an economic driver, generating $21 billion a year, according to the mayor\u2019s office. While the city\u2019s cultural affairs budget \u2014 which supports institutions in city buildings, as well as programming at other arts organizations \u2014 has remained relatively flat during his tenure, the capital budget for arts groups has markedly increased. Since 2002, the city has spent $2.8 billion on cultural expansions, renovations and new construction.         \n\n\u201cThe impulse has been to try and say yes to projects,\u201d said Kate D. Levin, the New York City cultural affairs commissioner.         \n\nPerhaps most crucially, Mr. Bloomberg has been a philanthropic angel. Since 2002, he has given more than $200 million of his personal fortune to arts (and social service groups) around the city \u2014 first anonymously, through the Carnegie Corporation of New York (though everyone knew it was he) and for the last two years through Bloomberg Philanthropies, which was formed in 2006.         \n\nHis company, Bloomberg LP, also supports the arts; it sponsors the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s audio guide program, for example, and \u201cRaw/Cooked,\u201d at the Brooklyn Museum, which showcases the work of lesser-known Brooklyn artists.         \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s up there philanthropically with Warren Buffett and Bill Gates,\u201d said Emily K. Rafferty, the president of the Met. \u201cEverybody is concerned about what happens after he goes.\u201d         \n\nThe foundation grants have gone to relatively large institutions, like the five major museums that just received $15 million for mobile technology. But they have also been given to small local ones, including\u00a0the\u00a0 Ghetto Film School in the Bronx, Harlem Stage, the Queens Symphony Orchestra and the Staten Island Children\u2019s Museum.\u00a0         \n\nMany groups are now trying to prepare for the loss of Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s private support. St. Ann\u2019s Warehouse, a theater with a $3 million operating budget that presents experimental work in Brooklyn, learned in December that the grants might not be renewed \u2014 it received one for $200,000 in 2011 and one for $150,000 the next year.\u00a0        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/02/arts/art-world-fears-losing-a-mayor-and-his-money.html", "date": "2013-07-01", "description": "As Mayor Michael R.
