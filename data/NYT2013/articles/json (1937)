{"headline": "Promised Fix for Health Site Could Squeeze Some Users", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration said Friday that it would fix problems in the federal health insurance marketplace by Nov. 30, just two weeks before the deadline to sign up for coverage to replace health insurance policies being canceled because they do not meet new federal standards.         \n\nTo help meet that schedule, the Obama administration, in an abrupt shift, named a \u201cgeneral contractor\u201d on Friday to oversee changes to the troubled Web site of the federal marketplace.         \n\nSuch a condensed time frame raises the question of how hundreds of thousands of people whose current policies do not comply with the health law will obtain new coverage in time, and how millions who may qualify for subsidies will enroll. Some experts predicted a groundswell of demands from Congress and elsewhere to delay the deadlines.         \n\nJeffrey D. Zients, President Obama\u2019s troubleshooter on the project, said the general contractor, Quality Software Services Inc., a unit of the UnitedHealth Group, would now \u201cmanage the overall effort,\u201d like a general contractor on a home improvement project. Notably, that company had a role in developing one of the most troubled components of the marketplace, which helped verify the identities of those registering.         \n\nUntil now, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services served as the project\u2019s quarterback. Contractors complained that the agency did not have the expertise to lead such a complex and ambitious undertaking, requiring the integration of dozens of programs and databases.         \n\nPeople involved in the repair effort said the Nov. 30 deadline was challenging but not impossible to meet. Mr. Zients, a management expert who is in line to take over as the chief White House economic adviser on Jan. 1, said, \u201cBy the end of November, HealthCare.gov will work smoothly for the vast majority of users.\u201d         \n\n\u201cIt will take a lot of work,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of problems need to be addressed. But let me be clear: HealthCare.gov is fixable.\u201d         \n\nSince it went live on Oct. 1, the Web site has frustrated millions of people trying to obtain insurance under Mr. Obama\u2019s health care law. For the administration, making it work is increasingly urgent for both political and practical reasons.         \n\nIn recent weeks, insurance companies have notified hundreds of thousands of people around the country that their current coverage will end on Dec. 31 because it does not comply with the Affordable Care Act. For example, the policies may not provide \u201cessential health benefits\u201d like maternity care and may not cover as much of the medical costs as required by new federal standards.         \n\nIn a typical letter, about 25,000 policyholders of Independence Blue Cross in Pennsylvania were informed, \u201cAs a result of the health care law, your current health plan will be discontinued effective December 31, 2013.\u201d         \n\nConsumers living in Washington, D.C., were informed by CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield that \u201cyour current plan will cease to exist\u201d on Jan. 1 because it does not conform to the new federal mandates.         \n\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida said it was informing about 300,000 subscribers that their insurance policies did not meet the new requirements.         \n\nConsumers are typically offered new coverage that meets federal standards, but the cost of comparable policies may be more or less than what they now pay, depending on a person\u2019s age, income, family size, place of residence and tobacco use, among other factors.         \n\nMillions of consumers with individual policies are expected to qualify for subsidized rates. But the government must calculate the correct subsidies and process the enrollments \u2014 functions that were to be handled mainly by the Web site. People can also file applications on paper or by phone.         \n\nMore than 19 million people have visited the Web site in the three and a half weeks since it opened as the main online vehicle in 36 states for choosing insurance coverage. But insurance executives said they were still receiving incomplete and inaccurate data on those who manage to get through the application process.         \n\nMr. Zients said more than ninety percent of users were now able to create accounts, but only three out of ten were \u201cgetting through the application process.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/26/us/politics/general-contractor-named-to-fix-health-web-site.html", "date": "2013-10-25", "description": "The White House said that it would fix the insurance marketplace by Nov. 30, raising the question of how people whose current policies do not comply with the law will get new coverage in time."}
