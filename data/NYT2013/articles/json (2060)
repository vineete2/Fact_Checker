{"headline": "U.S. Player Ratings: Austria (1), U.S. (0)", "body": "\nVIENNA \u2014 On a cold night at Ernst Happel Stadium, the United States men\u2019s national soccer team ended its 2013 year Tuesday with a sloppy exhibition loss against an Austria team that failed to qualify for the World Cup.\u00a0         \n\nAfter a dull scoreless draw against Scotland on Friday night, the United States was able to create more chances against Austria, but it also turned the ball over too frequently and was sloppy over all in a 1-0 defeat. It was a disappointing end to a positive year in which the United States won the Gold Cup and finished first in its World Cup qualifying group.         \n\nThe nature of these exhibitions was to give Coach Jurgen Klinsmann a chance to evaluate his roster, and several players improved their standing. Geoff Cameron was given the rare opportunity to start at right back and made the most of it. The substitute midfielder Mix Diskerud also helped his case, providing a spark in the second half.\u00a0         \n\nNext up for the United States will be the annual January camp which will culminate in an exhibition for its first game of 2014.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n It was a solid performance from the New Jersey native, who distributed well and made all the saves expected of him. Rating: 6.0\u00a0         \n\n \n Usually a central defender for the United States, Cameron was given the chance against Austria to play right back, where he is a regular with Stoke City. Over all, he was the best American player as Austria had few chances down his side. He also was involved in the attack, and his crosses were dangerous. Rating: 7.0         \n\n \n After an average game against Scotland, Gonzalez was better against Austria, improving as the game wore on. Several times when Austria threatened, Gonzalez made an important clearance. Rating: 5.5         \n\n \n Im his second game for the national team, Brooks appeared nervous at the start. He should have cleared the low cross that led to Austria\u2019s goal. He was much better in the second half, but his grade suffered because he was partly at fault in one of the deciding moments of the game. Rating: 4.5         \n\n \n In a year in which Beasley has been converted to the United States team\u2019s left back, the results have been mixed. Against Austria, Beasley again showed that the move was still a work in progress. He was involved in the attack and was dangerous, but Austria had success attacking down his side. Rating: 5.0         \n\n \n As one of two United States defensive midfielders, Jones turned the ball over too frequently. As a result, the team lost the possession battle for long periods of time. He tried to push forward more than usual but rarely was dangerous. Rating: 4.5         \n\n \n With Fabian Johnson, Clint Dempsey and Landon Donovan injured, Bradley had the job of helping the United States win the midfield battle. He had several nice moments and helped kept the midfield in order when many others were having off-nights. Rating: 6.0         \n\n \n Playing on the right wing, Bedoya worked hard at both ends but had little to show for it. He was part of a few dangerous chances but was rarely a threat to the Austrian defense: Rating: 5.0         \n\n \n In his second start for the national team, Johannsson was asked to play a completely different role. Usually a forward counted on for shots on goal, Johannsson played in the midfield and was asked to distribute and create plays. He appeared uncomfortable. Rating: 5.0         \n\n \n After a surprisingly good outing against Scotland in which he came on in the second half, Shea was not a factor against Austria. He was rarely dangerous and lost the ball when under pressure from the Austrian defense. Rating: 4.0         \n\n \n In his usual role of starting as the lone forward, Altidore battled all night to win possession for the United States and was a handful for the defense. His finishing could have been better, but he was effective in creating offensive opportunities. Rating: 6.0         \n\n \n         \n\n\u00a0 \n The Seattle Sounders attacker was an improvement over Shea with his holdup ability, but he could not break down the defense. Rating: 4.5         \n\n \n The Rosenborg defender looked comfortable in the attack when he entered in the second half. He was a boost of energy and certainly helped his standing with the team. Rating: 6.0         \n\n \n Tuesday\u2019s game was a homecoming for Boyd, who plays his club soccer with Rapid Vienna. He was part of the buildup to a few good chances, but his execution was lacking. Still, the team played well with him on the field. Rating: 5.5         \n\n \n When he came on in the second half,, he was an improvement as the United States began to press for an equalizer. Rating: 5.5         \n\n \n It was a difficult task for Lichaj to replace Cameron, who was the top American player in the game. The Nottingham Forest right back did not make any major mistakes, but he was not impressive enough to be in contention for a spot on the World Cup roster. Rating: 5.5         \n\n \n After coming on late in the second half, Wondolowski did not play enough to earn a grade: Rating: Incomplete         \n\n \n         \n\n \n The effects of these November games are not going to be measured by the results, but rather by what Klinsmann learns as he prepares the team for the World Cup. He had an extended look at the newcomers John Brooks and Aron Johannsson, while perhaps seeing that Geoff Cameron may be an option to start at right back. His team lost and did not score, but it was a good opportunity to learn.
