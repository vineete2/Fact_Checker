{"headline": "Unemployed and Older, and Facing a Jobless Future", "body": "\nI WAS recently talking to a friend at a party whose husband \u2014 in his 60s \u2014 has been unemployed for more than two years. While there are many challenges, she said, one of the hardest things is trying to balance hope with reality.         \n\nShe wonders how to support him in his continued quest to find a job in his field of marketing and financial services while at the same time encouraging him to think about what his life would be like if he never worked in that field or had a full-time job again.         \n\n\u201cI wanted to move to what I thought was a healthier place. I wanted to turn the page,\u201d said my friend, who asked to be identified by her middle name, Shelley, since she didn\u2019t want to publicize her family\u2019s situation. \u201cHe saw it as vote of no confidence.\u201d         \n\nFor those over 50 and unemployed, the statistics are grim. While unemployment rates for Americans nearing retirement are lower than for young people who are recently out of school, once out of a job, older workers have a much harder time finding work. Over the last year, according to the Labor Department, the average duration of unemployment for older people was 53 weeks, compared with 19 weeks for teenagers.         \n\nThere are numerous reasons \u2014 older workers have been hit both by the recession and globalization. They\u2019re more likely to have been laid off from industries that are downsizing, and since their salaries tend to be higher than those of younger workers, they\u2019re attractive targets if layoffs are needed.         \n\nEven as they do all the things they\u2019re told to do \u2014 network, improve those computer skills, find a new passion and turn it into a job \u2014 many struggle with the question of whether their working life as they once knew it is essentially over.         \n\nThis is something professionals who work with and research the older unemployed say needs to be addressed better than it is now. Helping people figure out how to cope with a future that may not include work, while at the same time encouraging them in their job searches, is a difficult balance, said Nadya Fouad, a professor of educational psychology at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.         \n\nPsychologists and others who counsel this cohort need to help them face the grief of losing a job, and also to understand that jobs and job-hunting are far different now from how they used to be.         \n\n\u201cThe contract used to be, \u2018I am a loyal employee and you are a loyal employer. I promise to work for you my entire career and you train, promote, give benefits and a pension when I retire.\u2019 Now you can\u2019t count on any of that,\u201d she said. \u201cThe onus is all on the employee to have a portfolio of skills that can be transferable.\u201d         \n\nPeople in their 20s and 30s know that they need to market themselves and always be on the lookout for better opportunities, she said, something that may seem foreign to those in their 50s and 60s.         \n\nIf a counselor or psychologist \u201cdoesn\u2019t understand how the world of work has changed, they\u2019re not helping at all,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just talk about how it feels.\u201d         \n\nIn response to this concern, Professor Fouad and her colleagues have drawn up guidelines for the American Psychological Association to help psychotherapists better assist their clients with workplace issues and unemployment. It is wending its way through the association\u2019s committees.         \n\nOf course, not everyone who is unemployed and over 50 is equal. For some, the reality is that they need to find another job \u2014 any job \u2014 to survive. Others have resources that can allow them to spend more time looking for a job that might have the salary or status of their former position.         \n\nIn the first case, Professor Fouad said, \u201cYou need to decide what is the minimum amount of money you can make and how to go about finding it.\u201d In the second case, she said, it\u2019s necessary to examine what work means to you and how that may have to change.         \n\nIs it the high social status? The identity? The relationship with co-workers? It is important to examine these areas, perhaps with the help of a professional counselor, Professor Fouad said, to discover how to find such meaning or relationships in other areas of life.
