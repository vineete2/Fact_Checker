{"headline": "Seeing a Need for Oversight of New York\u2019s Lordly Towers", "body": "\nThey\u2019re arriving along 57th Street like a clutch of preening runway models, super-tall and skinny, the expensive playthings of Russian oligarchs and Chinese tycoons. A coupling of technology and wealth has bred this new, local hothouse species: leggy, cloud-piercing, sliver-thin residential towers.         \n\nThey capitalize on views of Central Park \u2014 \u201cthe money shot,\u201d in the indelicate phrase of Carol Willis, director of the Skyscraper Museum \u2014 over which these buildings will cast long, literal shadows. (She has organized  \n, on view through April 19.)         \n\nThe buildings are stirring some populist fury and prompting an argument: Do we need more public oversight when it comes to the city\u2019s stratospheric architecture? Are we selling off our skyline to the plutocrats? Or are those who occupy these spaces serving up much needed tax revenue to the city?         \n\nThere are no simple answers. But I believe there may be ways to thread the needle \u2014 to encourage ambitious buildings and also to curb bad design. First, however we must be clear-eyed about the options.         \n\n\u201cIf we can find a bunch of billionaires around the world to move here, that would be a godsend,\u201d  \n said somewhat peevishly when the buildings \u2014 none yet completed, some yet to break ground \u2014 had become a political football in the campaign for his successor. \u201cBecause that\u2019s where the revenue comes to take care of everybody else.\u201d         \n\nThat is, unless those billionaires don\u2019t actually live here: Buyers parking fortunes in places like One57, across from Carnegie Hall \u2014 where two penthouses reportedly sold for more than $90 million apiece \u2014 often keep their primary residences elsewhere, as James B. Stewart  \n. So they pay no city income tax, and in these new luxury buildings, property taxes are comparatively low \u2014 \u201ceven,\u201d the column pointed out \u201cas the city\u2019s services prop up the value of their trophy real estate.\u201d         \n\n \n, is Exhibit A in what we should be able to prevent. Developed by Extell, this 90-story apartment tower made headlines last year when \n as  \n approached. Its French architect, Christian de Portzamparc, won the  \n 19 years ago and during the late 1990s designed the compact LVMH Tower up the street, a jewel-like building.         \n\nThis one unravels as a cascade of clunky curves descending toward ribbons billowing into canopies. The conceit is falling water. The effect: a heap of volumes, not liquid but stolid, chintzily embellished, clad in acres of eye-shadow-blue glass offset by a pox of tinted panes, like age spots. It\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess how the building got past the drawing board. It is now enmeshed in an anticorruption  \n, centered around  \n that Albany legislators tucked into a real estate bill in January.         \n\nExtell is also the company that put up the two towers on Broadway at 99th Street that caused  \n on the Upper West Side that new zoning regulations were cooked up to stop construction of more high-rises in the neighborhood, effectively guaranteeing the views from Extell\u2019s buildings.         \n\nPerhaps even worse is yet another Extell project just a block away from One57. The Nordstrom Tower, at 1,424 feet, will be higher than the top floor of  \n. Its architects, Adrian Smith & Gordon Gill, designed the aspirational Burj Khalifa tower in Dubai. So far, only incomplete renderings of the Nordstrom Tower have been made public, although its signal gesture has already caused a big fuss: a cantilever over the Art Students League, a landmark building from the 1890s, in French Renaissance style, by Henry J. Hardenbergh. Picture a giant with one foot raised, poised to squash a poodle.         \n\nDespite strong community opposition, the city\u2019s  \n approved the cantilever in October. A Landmarks spokeswoman told me the other day that the commission is confined to assessing a project\u2019s impact at street level, and the cantilever, at 290 feet in the air, is high enough not to affect views of the Art Students League, as if nobody in New York ever looks up.         \n\nThat cantilever is necessary to provide a Nordstrom store with an unobstructed floor plan, Extell has explained. It also happens to ensure that apartments above the store will look onto Central Park by peeking around another luxe high-rise slated for a block north, to be designed by Robert A. M. Stern.         \n\nThe Landmarks Commission\u2019s review was, in effect, the public\u2019s chance. Nordstrom Tower and One57 were developed \u201cas-of-right,\u201d meaning their designs required no special permits from the City Planning Commission. Behind these super-tall buildings are New York zoning codes that permit builders to accumulate adjacent parcels of land then stack their air rights into a single structure occupying a part of the site.         \n\nWhat results isn\u2019t always tragic. Another developer, JDS, is erecting the skinniest of the new towers at  \n. It will be nestled into the courtyard of the landmark Steinway Hall by Warren & Wetmore, from the 1920s. The architects are the partners at SHoP, the New York firm. The project rises like a sugar wafer, a sleek glass sheet, facing north and south, finely undulating bands of terra cotta and bronze filigree decorating the extra-slim east and west facades. At the top, shallow setbacks reach a feathered crown. The project bids to update the romantic skyscraper drawings of  \n for the 21st Century.         \n\nA second ear-popping billionaires\u2019 lair may not end up badly either. For the developer Harry B. Macklowe, the architect Rafael Vi\u00f1oly has devised a minimalist needle, also nearly 1,400 feet, at  \n, between 56th and 57th Streets. Mr. Vi\u00f1oly has been in the news for a 37-story office building nicknamed the Walkie-Talkie in London whose reflective glass concentrated even that city\u2019s dim sunlight into  \n, potent enough to melt a Londoner\u2019s parked Jaguar. But the project here is different, its attenuated grid of concrete and glass an architectural riff on a Sol Lewitt sculpture.         \n\nSo, soon the view south from the park will be as if from inside the world\u2019s biggest chessboard, with the buildings on Central Park South mere pawns before the queens and bishops that blot the sky behind them.         \n\nWhat do these projects add at street level where the other 99 percent live? What\u2019s their return for claiming the skyline that is our collective identity?         \n\nWe need to be careful. Almost everybody hated the  \n at first. The  \n once stuck out like a sore thumb. Those buildings along Central Park South used to be among the city\u2019s tallest, intruding into the park over the treetops. Taste is tricky to legislate.         \n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean New York should consign its silhouette to private builders. The city should put a limit on air rights that can be merged without public review. Exceptional height should be earned, not just bought. Let community groups and city agencies weigh in. Developers will raise hell, but the move would not stop sky-high buildings from going up. Buildings striving for such height would just need to make a case for themselves aesthetically and otherwise. Developers might also give something back for the profits reaped as they leverage public assets like parks. They could pony up for affordable housing and improved transit.         \n\nThe next mayor also should explore \u201cview corridors,\u201d vistas that, like landmarks, New Yorkers prize and want to protect. London regulates views. New York already limits signs facing into parks. Does the skyline merit similar protection? That sort of question certainly matters more than who bought what for how much. We fixate on real estate porn. We need a healthier conversation about urban priorities.         \n\nA forthcoming report from the Municipal Art Society, called \u201cThe Accidental Skyline,\u201d bemoans what\u2019s happening on 57th Street, absent New Yorkers\u2019 input. It suggests any new tower casting a shadow over Central Park should require the approval of the City Planning Commission. That\u2019s a plausible trigger for public oversight, dependent on city commissioners with backbone who understand design.         \n\nOh, and the mayor could lobby to raise taxes on those out-of-town plutocrats buying zillion-dollar aeries.         \n\nMembers of the Art Students League haven\u2019t yet voted whether to approve the sale of their air rights to Extell for the Nordstrom Tower. While the league stands to gain millions, cranky artists might still succeed where Landmarks failed, and shelve the cantilever.         \n\nHere\u2019s hoping they do.
