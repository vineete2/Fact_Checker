You\u2019ve devoured a few blog posts about it.         \n\nMaybe it\u2019s that spot in Rome where clandestine tables are set up in an alley and  \n beneath the honeyed glow of street lamps. Maybe it\u2019s that tiny shop in a parking lot in Penang that sells the sublime coconut tarts, or the unglamorous strip mall in  \n where  \n once sweated over a bowl of spicy Thai boat noodles.         \n\nIf there\u2019s one thing you\u2019ve learned from watching all those shows with Mr. Bourdain, the voracious world traveler, it\u2019s that these out-of-the-way treasures do exist. You, too, can eat there.         \n\nThe only catch? You may need a little help.         \n\nIt\u2019s that line of thinking that explains the rise, over the last few years, of a new kind of travel specialist \u2014 so new, in fact, that they haven\u2019t coined a name for the job. For now, let\u2019s call them the food sherpas.         \n\nJust as a traditional Sherpa guide helps a mountain climber navigate the stresses and mysteries of a Himalayan peak, a food sherpa is a local expert who brings a hungry traveler to pockets of the culinary landscape that may otherwise seem out of reach.         \n\nYou\u2019ll find them in  \n and Barcelona, in Malaysia and Mexico. But don\u2019t go looking for a long, tortoise-paced phalanx of tourists in white sneakers trailing behind a guide who\u2019s waving a flag and barking memorized data through a megaphone. Food sherpas pride themselves in offering something different: an experience that gives small groups of visitors (sometimes as few as 2, and rarely more than 12) an intimate encounter with what\u2019s off the eaten path.         \n\n\u201cI usually don\u2019t like tours,\u201d said Lisa Rogovin, the entrepreneur behind a company called  \n, which oversees 25 to 40 deep dives, every month, into the diverse food scene of the San Francisco Bay Area. \u201cI really need to know that this is going to be real and authentic. I don\u2019t want to be on a bus. I don\u2019t want to be in a herd of cattle.\u201d         \n\nThat has been Rick Gelbard\u2019s goal for decades. \u201cMy wife and I had never actually taken a tour,\u201d said Mr. Gelbard, 62, a retired Panavision engineering executive who lives in California. \u201cWe have always preferred to travel independently.\u201d But while preparing for a trip to Rome and trying to figure out where to eat, he found the ocean of online data to be overwhelming.         \n\nBefore long, he came across a blog called  \n. He learned that Ms. Minchilli, a food writer and occasional New York Times contributor who has lived in Italy since 1988 (and who spent some of her childhood there), could be hired as a private emissary to gastronomic gems around the city.         \n\n\u201cI just thought, \u2018Let\u2019s try this out,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Gelbard said.         \n\nWhat followed, once he and his wife landed in Rome, was a day of dining like a Bourdain-in-training: cappuccinos in a coffeehouse that looked as if it hadn\u2019t changed since the early 1970s; a sampling of fresh mozzarella and burrata; deep-fried artichokes in a working-class osteria; and trays of delicious cured meats from a deli so nondescript that a casual tourist would probably walk right past it.         \n\n\u201cIt was a kind of experience you just don\u2019t get if you\u2019re wandering around by yourself,\u201d Mr. Gelbard said. \u201cWhat it felt like is, I met up with an old friend who\u2019s been living in Rome for a decade, and she showed us around.\u201d         \n\nThe old-friend treatment isn\u2019t cheap. In some cases, enlisting the services of a first-class food sherpa can cost the same as dinner at a Michelin-starred restaurant: from $75 or $100 a person to as much as $1,000 for a small group, for what is often a three- or four-hour excursion. (The food tends to be included.)         \n\nThen there\u2019s the inevitable downside of any booming trend: with food tours cropping up all over, you could pick one led by a local chef, an award-winning cookbook author or an experienced blogger, or you could wind up with some food-truck-savvy charlatan who just moved to town.         \n\n\u201cYou get what you pay for,\u201d Ms. Rogovin said. \u201cMy tours cost more than the other tours, but I hire informed industry insiders to lead them.\u201d         \n\nFood tours, both the good and the mediocre, are flourishing because food consciousness is, too. Meg Zimbeck, who arranges tours through the  \n site, which she founded, has seen \u201can increase in people who are traveling to eat,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is as important for them as going to the Eiffel Tower.\u201d         \n\nThey relish visiting \u201cplaces that will give them bragging rights when they go back home,\u201d and if they\u2019re feasting on, say, cheese, they want insights that go beyond the rudimentary.
