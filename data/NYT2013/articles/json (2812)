{"headline": "Out of Foster Care, Into College", "body": "\nBY definition, foster children have been delinquent, abandoned, neglected, physically, sexually and/or emotionally abused, and that does not take into account nonstatutory abuses like heartache. About two-thirds never go to college and very few graduate, so it\u2019s a safe bet that those who do have an uncommon resilience.         \n\nIn a society where many young men and women live with their parents well into their 20s, foster children learn quickly that they are their own responsibility. To find someplace to live in 10th grade Kaleef Starks, now an A student at the University of California, Los Angeles, but back then (to use his words) a gay, effeminate, abused teenager, went to the local library, logged onto a computer and Googled \u201chomeless shelters for youth.\u201d         \n\nHis closest friend at U.C.L.A., Bianca Boccara, had parents who made her go panhandling with them because they knew passers-by would be more likely to donate if they saw a young child.         \n\nBy the time he was 18, Manny Roque, now a student at Los Angeles City College, had lived in seven foster homes and attended five high schools. He was raised by a mother who was a crack addict and prostitute, growing up in such chaos that he did not go to school until sixth grade and only then did he understand how abnormal it was for a boy his age not to be able to name the letters of the alphabet.         \n\nOne of his classmates, Shamir Moorer, \u201cborn with crack inside me,\u201d estimates she\u2019s lived in \u201c15 or 17\u201d foster and group homes. She can\u2019t say for sure because she can\u2019t remember the earliest ones, having been placed in care as a baby.         \n\n\u2022         \n\nIN a 2010 study by researchers at the University of Chicago, only 6 percent of former foster youths had earned a two- or four-year degree by age 24. Those not in college may be in jail; 34 percent who had left foster care at age 17 or 18 reported being arrested by age 19.         \n\nMost of the research is bleak \u2014 but not all. It appears that extra support can make a difference. The  \n tracked the lives of about 700 foster children in Illinois, Iowa and Wisconsin. Those in Illinois who were still getting foster care services at age 19 were less likely to have been arrested (22 percent versus 34 percent) than those in the other two states who were on their own. The same was true for education. The foster children from Illinois, which has long allowed young people to remain in care until their 21st birthday, were more likely to have completed at least one year of college than their counterparts from Iowa or Wisconsin, where the age of emancipation at the time was 18.         \n\nWhich is why a growing number of colleges \u2014 from those that are selective, like U.C.L.A., to those that are not, like Los Angeles City College \u2014 have created extensive support programs aimed at current and former foster young people. At U.C.L.A., this includes scholarships, year-round housing in the dorms for those who have no other place to live, academic and therapeutic counseling, tutoring, health care coverage, campus jobs, bedding, towels, cleaning products, toiletries and even occasional treats. Ms. Boccara mentioned the gift cards she was given to a local supermarket. At Los Angeles City College, Marcellia Goodrich likes the free snacks in the program office and Mr. Roque noted the free paper. \u201cIt\u2019s useful and helps you stay on budget,\u201d he said.         \n\nNo one tracks college programs for foster youth. But it is clear there has been considerable growth in recent years, spurred in part by the creation in 2003 of the Chafee grant program, an annual $48 million federal appropriation used to award scholarships of up to $5,000. Also important was federal legislation in 2008 giving states the option of extending federal aid programs for foster youth from age 18 to 21.         \n\nSeven states are considered to have particularly strong programs. California\u2019s is known as the  \n. Texas, Ohio and North Carolina call theirs \n; Michigan has  \n; Washington,  \n; and Virginia,  \n. Many colleges provide some services, but a far smaller number have the kinds of comprehensive support systems offered at places like Western Michigan University, Sam Houston State University, City College of San Francisco, and community colleges in Tallahassee, Fla., and Austin, Tex.
