{"headline": "World Bids Farewell in the Land Mandela Freed", "body": "\nSOWETO, South Africa \u2014 For a day, the world came to Nelson Mandela\u2019s adopted hometown. There were celebrities: Bono, Naomi Campbell, Charlize Theron. There were kings-in-waiting: Crown Prince Haakon of Norway and Crown Prince Felipe of Spain. There were more presidents and prime ministers than at just about any other setting outside a United Nations General Assembly.         \n\nIt was a singular gathering to celebrate a life virtually unmatched in modern times, and the  \n reflected Mr. Mandela\u2019s enduring legacy of forgiveness and reconciliation, as well the messy and sometimes clashing global allegiances of his party, the African National Congress.         \n\nPresident Obama gave a eulogy that stirred the crowd, only to be followed later by President Ra\u00fal Castro of Cuba. The two even shared an unexpected handshake. Old friends met happily in the V.I.P. area, while old enemies, like former Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, avoided each other.         \n\n\u201cIt took a man like Madiba to free not just the prisoner, but the jailer as well; to show that you must trust others so that they may trust you; to teach that reconciliation is not a matter of ignoring a cruel past, but a means of confronting it with inclusion and generosity and truth,\u201d Mr. Obama said in  \n, referring to Mr. Mandela by his clan name. \u201cHe changed laws, but he also changed hearts.\u201d         \n\nSheets of driving rain swept across this former segregated township \u2014 an urban sprawl within sight of the glittery high rises of downtown Johannesburg \u2014 keeping many mourners away from the vast soccer stadium where Mr. Mandela made his last public appearance, during the World Cup in 2010. Still, tens of thousands of other South Africans, swathed in their national colors, came out to celebrate Mr. Mandela, who died on Thursday at the age of 95, some stomping their feet as protesters did during the movement that led to his release from prison in 1990 after 27 years of incarceration.         \n\n\u201cEven heaven is crying,\u201d one woman in the crowd declared as the deluge continued. \u201cWe have lost an angel.\u201d         \n\nThe day began with a joyful noise.         \n\nNothando Dube, 31, left her home in Soweto at dawn, joining a throng to sing old songs of the struggle against apartheid, waiting for the memorial to the man who brought democracy to South Africa and became its first black president. It was a moment for a country that at times still seems deeply divided by race, class, religion and tribe to join together once again as the Rainbow Nation of Mr. Mandela\u2019s dreams.         \n\n\u201cIt feels different when you sing it now as a free young person,\u201d said Ms. Dube, wearing an A.N.C. beret. \u201cYou try to reach that feeling, that emotion they were feeling when they sang that song in prison.\u201d         \n\nBut a few hours later, her mood had darkened. As jeers cascaded from the crowd aimed at South Africa\u2019s current president, Jacob Zuma, Ms. Dube was one of many rolling their arms in the gesture known the world over as a call to substitute a failing player in a soccer match. It was an unmistakable message to Mr. Zuma, who faces corruption charges and deep worries about his governing of the country.         \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be airing your laundry in front of everybody, but people wanted to send a message,\u201d she said. \u201cThe man on the street feels there\u2019s a lot that should have been done by now to fix the country.\u201d         \n\nLike many around the world, the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, praised Mr. Mandela\u2019s ability to look beyond past wrongs, bridge divisions and build a new nation, inspiring his own country and many others far beyond its borders.         \n\n\u201cHe showed the awesome power of forgiveness \u2014 and of connecting people with each other and with the true meaning of peace,\u201d Mr. Ban said in  \n. \u201cThat was his unique gift, and that was the lesson he shared with all humankind. He has done it again. Look around this stadium and this stage. We see leaders representing many points of view, and people from all walks of life. All here, all united.\u201d         \n\nBut what had been planned as a moment to reunite a nation struggling with a slumping economy, widening inequality, rampant corruption and deep political divisions ultimately showcased the broad discontent with South African politics today. Many attending the service booed and hooted at Mr. Zuma, who has for many come to symbolize all the lost promise of South Africa\u2019s peaceful transition from racist white rule to nonracial democracy.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t own a house even though I am always struggling,\u201d said George Tshotlego Mikobeni, 27 and unemployed, as he watched Mr. Zuma on stage at the memorial.         \n\n\u201cHe is not like Madiba,\u201d Mr. Mikobeni said. \u201cHe only cares about himself. This man spent all our money on his house, so many millions,\u201d he continued, referring to  \n, which were paid for with government money but included things that had nothing to do with security, according to a preliminary investigation.
