{"headline": "A Very Un-British Fight for the English Title", "body": "\nLONDON \u2014 The Boleyn Ground is as British as Buckingham Palace. It is the place where West Ham United was formed more than a century ago. It is a stadium synonymous with Bobby Moore, Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters, all core players in England\u2019s 1966 World Cup triumph.         \n\nWest Ham was a tough area in the Docklands area of East London, but its players made the ball flow with a style as fluid as any in the world.         \n\nBut on Saturday, the Hammers were beaten on their own turf by Manchester City. The score, 3-1, barely did justice to the completeness with which City bamboozled West Ham through skill and rhythm and movement of players hired from abroad.         \n\nThe opening goal was redolent of the debate now engulfing the  \n. The lament is that homebred players can scarcely get on the ball, scarcely get a game in their own league, now that the big clubs hire two-thirds of their talents from overseas.         \n\nConversely, of course, there is absolute beauty \u2014 beyond the talents of any one country \u2014 being integrated into this league. City\u2019s first goal was a joy to behold or, if you blindly follow West Ham, a profound despair.         \n\nA Spaniard, Javi Garc\u00eda, began the move deep in his own half of the field. His pass found Fernandinho, a Brazilian who caressed the ball for a moment and then released it along the ground through the heart of West Ham\u2019s defense.         \n\nTwo men in the home team\u2019s claret and blue were attracted to that pass. But those defenders, James Tomkins and Winston Reid, were thrown off balance by the way that \u00c1lvaro Negredo, another Spaniard, dummied the ball, letting it run for Sergio Ag\u00fcero, the Argentine lurking behind him.         \n\nAg\u00fcero was then through, one on one against the goalkeeper. And he scored with a flick of his foot beyond that last man\u2019s reach or imagination.         \n\nIf you were a Londoner, you might weep at the ease with which the defense bought the dummy. If you were a City supporter, you would naturally thank the team\u2019s Abu Dhabi owner for bringing such players to the club.         \n\nAs for the neutrals \u2014 those watching in 200 countries where the Premier League is beamed via satellite television \u2014 this has become the norm. The league of all nations has Abu Dhabi\u2019s City; it has Roman Abramovich\u2019s polyglot Chelsea, which shredded Cardiff City, 4-1, on Saturday; and it has Arsenal, reinvigorated now that the German Mesut Ozil is its playmaker, swamping Norwich City, also by 4-1.         \n\nThe early indications are that City, Chelsea and Arsenal are running strong for what is still the English title. They are running to take the championship away from  \n, which has changed its coach and its management and is at least temporarily struggling in the quest to sign fresh talent.         \n\nIn fact, over the weekend, United did tie down Adnan Januzaj, the 18-year-old Belgian-born phenomenon of Albanian extraction, to a five-year deal. Januzaj played well Saturday, but his team was tied, 1-1, at Old Trafford by a resurgent Southampton, which, you may have guessed, is being shown new ways by a foreign coach.         \n\nAlmost everywhere one looks, the Englishness is being squeezed out of England\u2019s league. The numbers show that an average of 7 of every 11 starters for each of the league\u2019s 20 teams are imported. Their skills are fantastic and could be instructive to the homegrown players, if only those Britons could get on the field.         \n\nA superb and singular exception to this pattern came at Newcastle on Saturday when Steven Gerrard, England\u2019s captain, scored his 100th goal during his 449th match as a Liverpool player.         \n\nGerrard represents a dying breed. He has played for no other club, and he very likely will never stray from his beloved Liverpool. He mixes his game, of course, with players from other cultures, like the Uruguayan Luis Su\u00e1rez, but he leads, week in and week out, through example.         \n\nStevie G. leads with his heart, and he marauds in a quite old-fashioned English way, although he would not be up there with all those imported talents unless he could pass the ball, run and tackle with the best of them.         \n\nYet Gerrard\u2019s Liverpool did not win. It was tied, 2-2, by a Newcastle team that was reduced for half the game by the referee\u2019s correct application of the rules in sending off Newcastle defender Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa for a foul that led to Gerrard\u2019s penalty goal.         \n\nAgainst the odds, Newcastle, a team made up predominantly of French players, rallied to tie the game. Liverpool thus lost ground at the top of the standings to Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City.         \n\nBut it was City\u2019s away performance that rammed home the story. West Ham has made its fortress at the Boleyn (a stadium that draws its name from an association with Anne Boleyn, briefly the wife of King Henry VIII).         \n\nYet City, without a victory on the road this season until Saturday, laid bare the home advantage. Manchester\u2019s players and coaching staff have each contributed about $1,600 of their considerable salaries to help traveling fans buy tickets for away games.         \n\nSo there was some City blue among the Hammers. And there was some response from the players, whose Chilean coach, Manuel Pellegrini, is trying to change the culture of his team.         \n\nBefore he arrived, the previous coach of City, Roberto Mancini, instilled an Italian caution in his players away from home. Pellegrini believes the players, with the talents they have, should play the same way, at home or away.         \n\nOn Saturday, they did. Ag\u00fcero scored his second goal, and then he created another with a back-heel to David Silva, the inventive playmaker in City\u2019s attack.         \n\nIn between, a Hammer stole a goal. It was artistic, elegant and unexpected. Ricardo Vaz T\u00ea, with his back to goal, scored with an overhead scissors kick.         \n\nVaz T\u00ea? Born in Portugal, raised in Guinea-Bissau, another import to a global league.
