{"headline": "What Paintbrush Makers Know About How to Beat China", "body": "\nAs I toured Israel Kirschner\u2019s Bronx paintbrush factory earlier this month, I couldn\u2019t stop feeling amazed that it was still in business. Many days, Kirschner feels the same way. The charming, energetic 69-year-old joked about his ancient equipment (\u201cThat could be 100 years old,\u201d he said of a bristle-cleaning machine); his two least-committed employees, his son and daughter (\u201cThey come late, they leave early\u201d); and how his business has been increasingly undercut by Chinese manufacturers. After introducing me to his star brush maker, Fermin Gil, a Mexican immigrant who \u201ccan just  \n\u201d when a brush isn\u2019t right, Kirschner handed me a one-inch boar-bristle brush with a wooden handle. A Chinese manufacturer sells it for 30 cents. If he made it himself, he told me, it would cost significantly more.         \n\nChinese manufacturers long ago wreaked havoc on the U.S. textile, apparel, toy and electronics industries, but the disruption came slowly to the brush business. There are simply so many types of brushes for so many applications that many Chinese manufacturers thought the business wasn\u2019t worth the hassle. For decades, China lagged behind in the main categories (toothbrushes, brooms, mops and, of course, paintbrushes) and only dominated the lowest rung of the business \u2014 extracting bristles from boars. \u201cIt\u2019s dirty, smelly, foul work,\u201d David Parr, executive director of the American Brush Manufacturers Association, told me. \u201cNobody wants to go to West Texas to try to catch a boar and figure out how to get the bristles off him.\u201d         \n\nThe collapse of the housing market in 2007 and the subsequent recession turned out to be a boon for China\u2019s brush exports. With far less construction and far fewer jobs, not as many people needed paintbrushes (or brooms or toothbrushes). Those who did need them chose cheap imports over more expensive products made in America. Retailers, who stood to make more from the cheaper products, jumped at the opportunity to sell them. Now everyone in the business has to account for the Chinese.         \n\nThat\u2019s a familiar story for U. S. manufacturing. The strange thing here is that there are still more than 200 brush, broom and mop makers in the U.S. These companies have employed two strategies to stave off Chinese competition: 1) change everything all the time, or 2) don\u2019t ever change a thing. Kirschner hasn\u2019t changed a thing. He makes brushes the very same way, employing many of the same machines, that his father did 50 years ago. He told me that he sticks with the old ways because, unlike with toys and T-shirts, a big chunk of the brush business caters to professionals who aren\u2019t merely shopping for price but rather for quality. Michael Wolf, who runs the Greco Brush Company, a supplier to professional house painters, told me that his customers need to know before each job that every single bristle on every single brush will be attached properly. One loose fiber left on a wall can damage a painter\u2019s reputation, which in turn can hurt Wolf\u2019s too. Wolf said that he can buy brushes for between a quarter and a dollar cheaper in China, but he is never sure exactly what he\u2019ll get. Some orders are shoddy; others never arrive. So Greco sticks with the company he knows. \u201cMy father did business with his father back in the \u201950s,\u201d Wolf told me. \u201cWe\u2019re keeping it going, the two of us.\u201d         \n\nAt the other end of the business is Lance Cheney, 53, the fourth-generation president of Braun Brush, who told me that he would close his company rather than make the same kind of brush, the same way, for 50 years. He is constantly creating innovative brushes so that he never has any competition. Cheney makes a beaver-hair brush that\u2019s solely for putting a sheen on chocolate. He sells an industrial croissant-buttering brush and a heat-resistant brush that can clean hot deep fryers. His clients, he said, now include General Mills (he made a brush for their cereal-manufacturing line) and the energy industry (a line of expensive brushes for cleaning pipes in nuclear reactors). He even developed Brush Tile, fuzzy panels used in artistic wall hangings. He said his proudest creation is a tiny brush that helped Mars rovers dust debris from drilling sites. When Cheney sees other firms making one of his brushes, he often drops the product rather than enter a price war. Braun Brush, he said, has grown at 15 to 20 percent annually for the past five years.         \n\nKirschner\u2019s don\u2019t-change-a-thing strategy has not brought anything like this kind of growth. Last year, he says, \u201cwas a disaster.\u201d As was this spring. But June, so far, has been \u201cunbelievably good.\u201d Many of his customers are governmental agencies that prefer \u201cMade in the U.S.A.\u201d products or have precise needs that Chinese imports can\u2019t yet fill. Some of the paint on New York City subways and Texas prisons, for example, was applied by Kirschner brushes.
