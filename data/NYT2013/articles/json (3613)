{"headline": "How Do You Teach Kids to Eat Well When You\u2019re Not With Them?", "body": "\n\u201cYou are what you eat, from your head down to your feet!\u201d Growing up in the 1970s, I had the benefit of having \u201cTime for Timer\u2019s\u201d advice on healthy eating drummed into me weekly during Saturday morning cartoon binges. I may endlessly \u201chanker for a hunka, a slab, a slice, a chunka\u201d cheese, but I also knew that no kid could survive on sugar alone, because \u201call those motors in your body need a lot of fuel to go on,\u201d like a healthy breakfast and a balanced snack.         \n\nToday\u2019s parents lack Timer\u2019s help (except on YouTube), but the problems he was created to address remain. In the face of an even grander array of junk foods, easy snacks and corporate-created food messages, how do you teach children to eat a \u201cbalanced diet\u201d: to snack in moderation, to enjoy foods that haven\u2019t been  \n, and to make healthy choices when we\u2019re with them and when we\u2019re not?         \n\nWhen we\u2019ve discussed healthy eating on Motherlode in the past, a recurring theme among commenters has been the idea that parents don\u2019t just influence, but control, what their children eat. If you don\u2019t buy the junk, the mantra goes, they won\u2019t eat the junk. But at some point, most children find themselves in a position to make choices: in the school cafeteria, at a friend\u2019s house, or walking by the bodega on the way to the subway. How do you teach a child to bypass candy bars in favor of a banana, or simply to choose both a fun and a more nutritious option?         \nTime for Timer: \"Hanker for a Hunk o' Cheese\" \n\nOr maybe you\u2019re a parent who is trying to make changes \u2014 who hasn\u2019t always eaten a healthy diet yourself, of has relied heavily on processed foods. Your children may be less than enthusiastic about a sudden switch from dinners of frozen chicken nuggets and white rice to roasted cod and quinoa, and as true as it may be that if that\u2019s all there is, they\u2019ll (eventually) eat it, the transition is not as easy as it sounds.         \n\nIf you\u2019ve raised children who took healthy eating with them to college or beyond, changed your family\u2019s diet for the better or helped a child find a way to make better choices at lunch and beyond, we\u2019d like to hear from you.  \n to Booming, and next week, I\u2019ll round up the most interesting and useful for a post on the Motherlode blog.
