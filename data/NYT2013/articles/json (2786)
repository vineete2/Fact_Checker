{"headline": "The Real Story Behind the City\u2019s Deliverance From a Blood-Soaked Era", "body": "\nThe Republican mayoral nominee,  \n, went all retro on us last week, offering a commercial that had a 1970s \u201c \n,\u201d \u201c \n\u201d jolt.         \n\nLagging in voter polls by impressive margins \u2014 an unfortunate number of voters seem not to know his name \u2014 Mr. Lhota decided to get their attention by scaring the devil out of them.  \n noting that his Democratic opponent,  \n, \u201cvoted to take over 5,000 cops off our streets.\u201d         \n\nMr. de Blasio\u2019s \u201crecklessly dangerous agenda on crime will take us back to this.\u201d At that, the commercial cued a post-apocalyptic triptych of photos, from the Crown Heights riot to a dead man under a sheet to pornography shops and a deeply frightened woman on a subway train.         \n\nThis is pretty scary stuff, not to mention deeply, wildly misleading.         \n\nMr. de Blasio, as a councilman, voted as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg desired and brought the police head count down from about 40,000 to 35,000. Cause and effect, however, has not worked out as Mr. Lhota suggests.         \n\nDuring Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s tenure,  \n dropped to 419 last year, from 587 in 2002. And the city\u2019s police force is regarded as among the nation\u2019s most diverse and sophisticated.         \n\nIn fact, you might argue that a man committed to good management \u2014 and Mr. Lhota has a fine record in that regard \u2014 would recognize the city could get by with fewer officers than 20 years ago, when crime was four times higher.         \n\nWe in fact often have great trouble in thinking about our deliverance from crime\u2019s caldron, even deep into our safest era in a century.         \n\nThe ragged, jagged, terrifying crime spree that peaked in the early 1990s was not unique to New York. It was a nationwide bloodletting, afflicting cities small, medium and large. And two other horsemen of the apocalypse, the epidemics of crack and AIDS, galloped hard in those years.         \n\nIn Los Angeles, homicides peaked at 1,092 in 1992; the total stood at 292 last year. In Washington, D.C., homicides hit a high of 482 in 1991; the number stood at 88 on Monday. Dallas recorded 500 in 1991; it had 154 in 2012. In Chicago, homicides crested at 942 in 1991 and stood at 500 last year.         \n\nPolicing had a hand in this decline, along with demographics and the brave willingness of neighbors to organize and fight back. This was particularly true in New York City, where crime has fallen far faster than the national average.         \n\nBut often it\u2019s as if we cannot celebrate our good fortune without embracing a narrative of blame: that previous mayors had proved feckless and turned their cheeks while young men and their guns wreaked havoc. To this end, Mr. Lhota aimed a haymaker at former Mayor David N. Dinkins.         \n\n\u201cDavid Dinkins,\u201d Mr. Lhota huffed, \u201cmore people died when he was mayor, than anything you can possibly imagine.\u201d         \n\nIt\u2019s hard to know where to begin. Does he imagine that crime fighting in the violent days of the late 1980s and early 1990s was a too gentlemanly affair in which social worker cops asked young thugs to, please, holster their guns? I don\u2019t recall that, although I do remember spending a week in 1990 with a street narcotics unit on the then-aptly named Crooke Avenue in Flatbush. We hurtled around, cops with guns drawn, pushing suspects by the dozens against walls, and grabbing garbage bags full of crack vials.         \n\nA week earlier, an officer in that same 70th Precinct was ambushed and killed by a young desperado. Three weeks later, another officer died.         \n\nAnother perhaps confounding fact arises from that era. Mayor Dinkins\u2019s first deputy police commissioner that year was an innovative officer, Raymond W. Kelly,  \n.         \n\nNone of this is to argue against hard scrutiny of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s positions on crime fighting. There are thoughtful voices to be heard who worry that a court-appointed monitor and a new, de Blasio-supported inspector general could turn lines of command into a confusing welter.         \n\nSome whisper that Mr. de Blasio, who has never governed,  \n, who was Rudolph W. Giuliani\u2019s first and most successful police commissioner.         \n\nMr. Lhota has heard these same rumors. But he extends no welcoming hand to a fellow Giuliani administration alum. Mr. Bratton, he huffed, was \u201cthe most egotistical police commissioner we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d         \n\nBut then, by now, you probably expected Mr. Lhota to say that.
