{"headline": "Tap on Merkel Provides Peek at Vast Spy Net", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 It was not obvious to the  \n a dozen years ago that  \n, a rising star as the leader of the Christian Democratic Union, was a future chancellor of  \n.         \n\nBut that did not matter.         \n\nThe N.S.A., in a practice that dates back to the depths of the Cold War and that has never ended, was recording her conversations and those of a range of leaders in Germany and elsewhere, storing them in databases that could be searched later, if the need arose. It is unclear how often they searched the databases for her conversations, if at all.         \n\nBut once she became the country\u2019s leader, everything she talked about on her personal cellphone \u2014 like her support of the Afghan war, the efforts of European allies to halt  \n, and Germany\u2019s central role in quelling the  \n \u2014 took on greater importance for the American eavesdroppers.         \n\nHow the N.S.A. continued to track Ms. Merkel as she ascended to the top of Germany\u2019s political apparatus illuminates previously undisclosed details about the way the secret spy agency casts a drift net to gather information from America\u2019s closest allies. The phone monitoring is hardly limited to the leaders of countries like Germany, and also includes their top aides and the heads of opposing parties. It is all part of a comprehensive effort to gain an advantage over other nations, both friend and foe.         \n\nWhat the United States has learned from Ms. Merkel\u2019s calls since 2002, the year when surveillance on her began, according to a database described last week in the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, remains unknown. But no one has denied that she was being monitored.         \n\nIn testimony to Congress on Tuesday, the director of national intelligence,  \n, gave only the roughest sketch of the size of the N.S.A.\u2019s surveillance program, but suggested that the leader of the United States\u2019 most powerful European ally was a single fish in a very big sea.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about a huge enterprise here with thousands and thousands of individual requirements,\u201d he said, using a phrase that appeared to mean individual surveillance targets. Mr. Clapper said that the United States spies on foreign leaders and other officials to see \u201cif what they\u2019re saying gels with what\u2019s actually going on,\u201d and how the policies of other countries \u201cimpact us across a whole range of issues.\u201d         \n\nGerman political and intelligence officials went to the White House on Wednesday looking for answers to some of the questions the administration has been reluctant to discuss, and eager to use the incident to broker a far closer intelligence-sharing agreement with Washington that, among other things, would end the surveillance of its leaders.         \n\nIf put into effect, such an arrangement could begin to dismantle a system that has grown ever larger, and more sophisticated, during a decade in which supercomputers and the algorithms used to search vast databases have put the N.S.A. far ahead of rival intelligence services. President Obama has asked whether the technology has outrun common sense, and the Merkel episode has raised in a very public way the question of whether the benefits of spying on friends outweigh the damage if such spying becomes known.         \n\nEven after the flood of information about surveillance operations made public by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor, American officials are still loath to speak in detail about eavesdropping on friendly governments. But former officials with knowledge of the system described an intelligence apparatus with both a voracious appetite and a growing ability to warehouse huge amounts of data.         \n\nThe N.S.A. tries to gather cellular and landline phone numbers \u2014 often obtained from American diplomats \u2014 for as many foreign officials as possible. The contents of the phone calls are stored in computer databases that can regularly be searched using keywords.         \n\n\u201cThey suck up every phone number they can in Germany,\u201d said one former intelligence official.         \n\nThe databases are different from those housing telephone \u201cmetadata\u201d \u2014 information about phone numbers on each end of a call and the call\u2019s length \u2014 to find links between terrorism suspects. \u201cMetadata is only valuable if you are trying to track the activities of a terrorist or a spy,\u201d said the former American intelligence official.         \n\nBy comparison, allied leaders are low-level priorities. In the \u201cNational Intelligence Priorities Framework,\u201d a matrix approved by the president and updated regularly, information on members of Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups, the whereabouts of  \n in Pakistan or North Korea, or the conversations of nuclear scientists in Iran are all front-burner intelligence issues. Ranked just below them are questions about the leadership of adversaries, like Russia, China or Iran, or the state of their economies.
