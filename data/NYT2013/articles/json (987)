Yanukovich\u2019s dismissiveness with their biggest rally so far, demanding that he and his government resign.         \n\nAt the height of the unrest on Sunday night, a seething crowd toppled and smashed a statue of Lenin, the most prominent monument to the Communist leader in Kiev. The act was heavy with symbolism, underscoring the protesters\u2019 rage at Russia over its role in the events that first prompted the protests: Mr. Yanukovich\u2019s abrupt refusal to sign sweeping political and free-trade agreements with the European Union.         \n\nAfter an electrifying assembly in Independence Square in the center of Kiev, the main focus of the protests, the huge crowd surged across the capital, erecting barriers to block the streets around the presidential headquarters and pitching huge tents in strategic intersections. They were not challenged by the police, who have largely disengaged since their bloody crackdown on a group of protesters on Nov. 30 sharply increased outrage at the government.         \n\nInternational concern over the unrest in Ukraine appeared to deepen on Sunday, as the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, telephoned Mr. Yanukovich and Western leaders continued to call on him to respond to the demonstrators\u2019 demands. The European Union has been eager to draw Ukraine, a nation of 46 million, into closer alliance with the West, while Russia has sought to safeguard its major economic and political interests in its close neighbor. Making the crisis more acute, Ukraine is teetering on the verge of bankruptcy and is desperate for financial assistance from abroad.         \n\nThe spreading disorder set off a new round of speculation that Mr. Yanukovich would declare a state of emergency and potentially turn again to force by ordering the removal of demonstrators who have occupied Independence Square and several public buildings, including Kiev\u2019s City Hall. There were reports on Sunday that the security services were preparing to bring charges of treason against three opposition leaders in Parliament who have been at the forefront of the demonstrations.         \n\nOne of those leaders, Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk, of the opposition Fatherland party, called for mass civil disobedience if Mr. Yanukovich tried to impose martial law. \u201cIn the case that a state of emergency is declared, everyone should go to Maidan,\u201d Mr. Yatsenyuk said, referring to Independence Square.         \n\nMr. Yanukovich only added to the demonstrators\u2019 anger by stopping on his way back from China on Friday to meet with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in Sochi, the Russian resort city. Rumors immediately began swirling that Mr. Yanukovich had cut a secret economic deal with Mr. Putin that would lead to Ukraine joining a customs union with Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, a step that many Ukrainians believe would deliver their country\u2019s future into the Kremlin\u2019s hands. Both governments denied the rumors, but the protesters do not trust either Mr. Putin or Mr. Yanukovich, and opposition leaders used the matter on Sunday to whip up the crowd in Kiev.         \n\n\u201cToday, they fall on their knees in front of the president of Russia and surrender us to the customs union,\u201d said Oleg Tyagnibok, the leader of the nationalist Svoboda Party. \u201cWe demand to make public what these secret negotiations were about. They bring us back to the time of Stalinism. Is this 1937?\u201d         \n\nLater, as the Lenin statue was pulled down and men took turns splintering it to bits with a sledgehammer, protesters twice sang the national anthem, removing their caps and covering their hearts with their hands. One of the hammerers wore his hair in a mohawk; another was a priest in black vestments. Onlookers shielded their faces from the flying granite chips as they cheered them on, yelling: \u201cGood job, guys.\u201d         \n\nA spokesman for Prime Minister Mykola Azarov called the statue\u2019s destruction \u201cbarbaric.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/09/world/europe/kiev-teems-with-pro-europe-protesters-as-thousands-more-gather.html", "date": "2013-12-08", "description": "Protests in Ukraine\u2019s capital, which have grown for two weeks and seemed to reach new heights Sunday, show the depth of rage at Ukraine\u2019s president, who has few palatable options to defuse the country\u2019s crisis."}
