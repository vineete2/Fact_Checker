{"headline": "Do You Get In Any Reading Over the Holidays?", "body": "\nEach week in Bookends, two writers take on questions about the world of books. This week, Anna Holmes and Pankaj Mishra reminisce about travel, solitude and guilty pleasures.         \n\n \n         \n\n \n         \nAnna Holmes \n\nThe ugly truth about my holiday reading routine is that I make every attempt to avoid reading holiday books. Listen, there are lots of ways I could answer this question \u2014 yarns I could spin to put my seasonal shortcomings in the best possible light. I could say, for example, that I spend every holiday (and let\u2019s be clear, I\u2019m talking Christmas) catching up on my favorite birth-of-Jesus stories from the Gospels of Matthew and Luke. I could say that in between tending to my famous roasted brussels sprouts and Shaker lemon pie, I like to pore over books like \u201cMartha Stewart\u2019s Christmas\u201d or \u201cPresentations: A Passion for Gift Wrapping,\u201d which is apparently a real thing in the world. I could craft some sort of cozy collage of my family \u2014 mother, father, younger sister \u2014 sitting together in my mom\u2019s modest suburban living room, acting out excerpts from a Nelson Doubleday Christmas collection as we sip hot chocolate and the calico cat, Miss Kitty, settles in before the fireplace.         \n\nBut that would be fibbing, because the reality is, I\u2019m not religious, I don\u2019t know how to cook and Miss Kitty is utterly terrified of the fireplace. As for that Nelson Doubleday collection, titled \u201cThe Christmas Eve Reader,\u201d it exists, but we haven\u2019t opened it since 1985. (The edition we own, published in 1976, is in what used-book sellers describe as \u201clike new\u201d condition.) No, the reality is that when I travel across the country to the 1,200-square-foot home I lived in as a child, I gravitate not to Barbara Robinson\u2019s \u201cThe Best Christmas Pageant Ever,\u201d Lillian Smith\u2019s \u201cMemory of a Large Christmas\u201d or any number of other books lovingly exhumed from my mother\u2019s bamboo Christmas chest, but to a pair of teak bookshelves in a tiny, dark room down the hallway.         \n\nLike most people, I have a tendency to seek shelter when stressed, and Christmas in California, for all its charms, is not immune to the occasional \u2014 O.K., recurrent \u2014 exasperated sigh or ugly outburst. But that tiny, dark room down the hallway, now an office, was once my bedroom, and it\u2019s as much a portal as it is a hiding place, because nestled among the three-ring binders of contracts and other detritus from my mother\u2019s real estate career are dozens and dozens of children\u2019s books. There are chapter books, like the hardcover editions of titles by Beverly Cleary, E. B. White, Johanna Spyri, Emma Gelders Sterne and Gertrude Chandler Warner. There are religious texts, like the not insubstantial number of children\u2019s Bibles my Protestant maternal grandmother gave me in hopes that the ideas inside would take. (They didn\u2019t.) There are Little Golden Books, those colorful, 8-by-6.5-inch midcentury gems with stories documenting all manner of charming animal friends (poky puppies, tawny lions, saggy elephants, shy kittens); jolly civil servants (a chubby fireman, a fat policeman); anthropomorphized vehicles (curious tugboats, naughty locomotives); and colonial aggression dressed up as innocent adventure-making.         \n\nIs it embarrassing to admit I read children\u2019s books for fun during the Christmas season? Sort of. But the truth is that my holiday reading routine is less about performing convention (I\u2019ve never read \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d) or exhibiting fealty to an orthodoxy I never quite accepted (sorry, Grandma) than it is about reconnecting with my first experiences of storytelling. And to do that, I have to, literally, go home again. (There is no room in my New York apartment for children\u2019s books. Or children.)         \n\nOnce, after a glass or two of mulled Christmas Eve wine, I retired to my old room to spend a few minutes with \u201cCars and Trucks and Things That Go,\u201d in search of Goldbug, the elusive, tiny yellow arthropod \u2014 most likely a beetle \u2014 who hitches rides on the sports cars, taxis, tow trucks and school buses that make up Richard Scarry\u2019s 1974 picture book classic. The book, a Christmas present I received when I was 3 or 4, is an illustrated love letter to moving vehicles of all shapes and purposes. I counted Goldbug 12 times, then shuffled back out to the dining room to eat some pie.
