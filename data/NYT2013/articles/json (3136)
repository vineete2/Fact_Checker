{"headline": "When Labeling Yourself Middle Class Can Hold You Back", "body": "\n \n         \n\nWhen politicians try to persuade us to support something they want, they often invoke the middle class. They talk about protecting the middle class. They talk about how important the middle class is to the economy. But the main reason they talk about the middle class is because most of us think they\u2019re talking about us.         \n\nIt seems to me that we really like the idea of what it means to be middle class. And why wouldn\u2019t we? For most of us, we associate it with things like having steady jobs, owning a home and taking regular vacations. It\u2019s the American dream brought to life, and we like it so much that it\u2019s become not only an economical identity but a cultural one, too.         \n\nIf you think I\u2019m exaggerating, take a look at  \n. The results revealed that what we define as middle class has more to do with how we think of ourselves than any particular number. Not too surprisingly, we tend to compare ourselves against what we know:         \n\n\u25a0 48 percent of people earning $40,000 \u2013 $50,000 consider an income of $50,000 middle class.         \n\n\u25a0 50 percent of people earning $50,000 \u2013 $75,000 consider their income middle class.         \n\n\u25a0 39 percent of people earning $75,000 \u2013 $100,000 consider their income middle class.         \n\nWhy does this matter? Because labels with strong emotions behind them, like \u201cmiddle class,\u201d change how we think about ourselves and make decisions, especially financial ones. For instance, when people identify themselves as middle class, I see many of them make a common mistake: they fail to engage in the process of financial planning.         \n\nThe reasons probably won\u2019t surprise you, but if people call themselves middle class, they probably don\u2019t think in terms of having wealth or assets that can benefit from financial planning. They think in terms of having a mortgage, a 401(k) and maybe a savings account. They\u2019re not wealthy, and only the wealthy need to worry about investing or planning.         \n\nThat\u2019s wrong on so many levels.         \n\nI\u2019m not arguing that we\u2019re all secretly wealthy. I\u2019m suggesting that we\u2019re cheating ourselves out of greater financial security because we\u2019re making an assumption about what the labels mean. The reality is that most of us have good reasons to plan for the future, like buying a home, paying for college and enjoying retirement.         \n\nThere is no reason we shouldn\u2019t be using every tool available to help us improve the odds we\u2019ll reach those goals. It doesn\u2019t matter that we may not have as many options as those available to an investment banker. We owe it to ourselves to understand the options we do have and then make plans that get us to where we want to go.         \n\nWe\u2019re making a similar mistake if we assume we won\u2019t find people to help us when we do need more help. The reasons often come down to money. Time after time, people will tell me they aren\u2019t seeking help because they can\u2019t afford it.         \n\nThe problem with this assumption is that it ignores the professionals \u2014 C.P.A.'s, lawyers, advisers \u2014 who make it their mission to help people who don\u2019t have seven-figure balance sheets. There are plenty of them out there; we just need to take the time to find one if we need help.         \n\nWe\u2019ve got to stop making assumptions like this one and others like it. All they lead to is the common mistake of thinking that financial planning doesn\u2019t matter to people who identify with labels like middle class. I don\u2019t know of anyone who can afford the consequences of that particular thinking.         \n\nInstead, we need to make smart financial decisions and not limit our options based on how we label ourselves. We need to take the best information available and make the most of it, even if it means doing things we associate only with wealthy people. Regardless of how much, or how little, we think we have, we\u2019re cheating ourselves if we assume that we don\u2019t need a plan to take care of it and make the most of it.
