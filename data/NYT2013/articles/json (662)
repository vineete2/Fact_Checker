{"headline": "Danger! This Mission to Mars Could Bore You to Death!", "body": "\nRight now, six people are living in a nearly windowless, white geodesic dome on the slopes of Hawaii\u2019s Mauna Loa volcano. They sleep in tiny rooms, use no more than eight minutes of shower time a week and subsist on a diet of freeze-dried, canned or preserved food. When they go outside, they exit through a mock air lock, clad head to toe in simulated spacesuits. The dome\u2019s occupants are playing a serious version of the game of pretend \u2014 what if we lived on Mars?         \n\nResearch at the Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation (HI-SEAS) project, funded in part by NASA, is a continuation of a long history of attempts to understand what will happen to people who travel through outer space for long periods of time. It\u2019s more than a technical problem. Besides multistage rockets to propel a spacecraft out of Earth\u2019s atmosphere, years of planning and precise calculations and massive amounts of fuel, traveling the tens of millions of miles to Mars will take a tremendous amount of time. With current technology, the journey takes more than eight months each way.         \n\nWhich means that astronauts will get bored. In fact, a number of scientists say that \u2014 of all things \u2014 boredom is one of the biggest threats to a manned Mars mission, despite the thrill inherent in visiting another planet. And so, attention is being paid to the effects of boredom at HI-SEAS, and on the International Space Station. But because of the causes of chronic boredom, scientists say, research facilities in Antarctica might actually provide a better simulation of the stress of a journey to Mars.         \n\nMost living things constantly seek out sensory stimulation \u2014 new smells, tastes, sights, sounds or experiences. Even single-celled amoebas will move to investigate new sources of light or heat, says Sheryl Bishop, who studies human performance in extreme environments at the University of Texas Medical Branch. Animals deprived of naturalistic environments and the mental stimulation that come with them can fall into repetitive, harmful patterns of behavior. Anybody of a certain age will remember zoos full of manically pacing tigers, bears gnawing on their metal cages and birds that groomed themselves bald \u2014 all a result, we now know, of their rather unstimulating lifestyles.         \n\nHuman boredom isn\u2019t quite as well understood, says James Danckert, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at the University of Waterloo. He\u2019s currently working on what he says may be the first study of how our brain activity changes when we\u2019re bored. Danckert is hoping to find out whether boredom is connected to a phenomenon called the \u201cdefault network\u201d \u2014 a background hum of brain activity that seems to remain on even when you aren\u2019t directly focused on something. There\u2019s a lot of observable activity in the brains of people who are staring at a blank screen \u2014 way more than anybody expected, Danckert says. The default network maps closely to the brain-activity patterns scientists see when someone\u2019s mind is wandering. It suggests that what we call a restless mind is just that \u2014 a mind desperate for something to amuse it, searching frantically for stimulus.         \n\nBoredom, it turns out, is a form of stress. Psychologically, it\u2019s the mirror image of having too much work to do, says Jason Kring, president of the Society of Human Performance in Extreme Environments, an organization that studies how people live and work in space, underwater, on mountaintops and other high-risk places. If your brain does not receive sufficient stimulus, it might find something else to do \u2014 it daydreams, it wanders, it thinks about itself. If this goes on too long, it can affect your mind\u2019s normal functioning. Chronic boredom correlates with depression and attention deficits.         \n\nAstronaut candidates go through two years of training before they\u2019re even approved to fly. And before they are chosen to be candidates, they have to compete against thousands of other applicants. The 2013 class, for instance, had more than 6,000 applicants and only 8 were chosen. Astronauts are rigorously tested for psychological as well as physical fitness. But no mission in NASA\u2019s history has raised the specter of chronic boredom to the degree that a Mars mission does, because none have involved such a long journey through nothingness.
