{"headline": "A New Year\u2019s Wish List for New York City", "body": "\nThe year we are putting behind us was dominated in New York by some of the liveliest politics in memory \u2014 or rather, some of the liveliest mayoral politics outside Toronto. We elected Bill de Blasio as the 109th mayor of the city and embraced his \u201ctale of two cities,\u201d but not until we milked the \u201ctale of two Anthony Weiners,\u201d one of them the story of a volatile and ineffectual former congressman, and the other the story of a prolific composer of lurid texts generated under the ingeniously conceived alias Carlos Danger.         \n\nInitially, Mr. Weiner was bad for Christine C. Quinn, but ultimately Christine C. Quinn, unable to scrub off the taint of Bloombergism, was bad for herself. Though once the presumptive heir to City Hall, Ms. Quinn, the City Council speaker, failed to win even her own Council district in the Democratic primary in September.         \n\nBeyond the mayor\u2019s race, it was the year of the Citi Bike, the blocking of the big-soda ban, the very welcome arrival of hail-able green cabs outside central Manhattan. We enter 2014 with a lot of expectation \u2014 we hope that Mayor-elect de Blasio, aided by a progressive Council, can come through on his promises to deliver universal prekindergarten and to reduce inequality. But at the more granular (and nonessential) level we wish for other things, too.         \n\nBelow is my  \n of things I\u2019d like to see in the coming year:         \n\n\u25a0 A crackdown on pedestrian fatalities: New York is a walker\u2019s city and increasingly, of course, a biker\u2019s city. Additionally, as more and more parts of the city gentrify, a suburban mentality has taken over, which leads us to think nothing of driving from Prospect Heights to do our grocery shopping at Fairway in Red Hook (or the new Whole Foods in Gowanus). And the city\u2019s new Westchester County persona is not peacefully coexisting with its Amsterdam side.         \n\nThe past year was marked by a series of high-profile pedestrian deaths, beginning with that of a 6-year-old boy walking to school in East Harlem in February. Days later, a mother hit by a car as she exited a bagel shop in Brooklyn Heights died. Also in Brooklyn, two boys were run over and killed this fall, one when he chased after a ball on Prospect Park West, and one who was walking with his mother in Fort Greene. Last month, two women crossing a street on Staten Island were fatally struck by a minivan.  \n by The New York Post found that pedestrian deaths were up this year over last. More safety strictures and more rigorous enforcement are needed.         \n\n\u25a0 A better-looking billionaires\u2019 ghetto: In the best of all possible worlds we wouldn\u2019t have  \n full of $90 million apartments and generous tax breaks clustering around 57th Street (or, in a more audacious suggestion, anywhere). But they are here and more are coming, casting their shadows on Central Park. If they must remain, can they offer more to the hundreds upon thousands who will be forced to walk by and look at them? The glass-and-steel soullessness of them all is enough to inspire nostalgia for 15 Central Park West, the mere multimillionaires\u2019 dorm designed by Robert A. M. Stern in that quaint era of less than 10 years ago.         \n\n\u25a0 No more hybrid pastry going viral: I speak here obviously of \n(a trademarked designation). Having made its debut at the Dominique Ansel Bakery on Spring Street this year, the Cronut grew so popular that it spawned a black market, with some selling the confections for $100 each. It also gave birth to copies like the Crumbnut at the cupcake chain Crumbs.         \n\nHow many people before this point had ever bitten into a croissant and said, \u201cI\u2019d finish this if only it tasted more like a doughnut\u201d? Also, where was Michael R. Bloomberg, enemy of all things fattening and caloric, with a municipal prohibition?         \n\n\u25a0 A vibrant Brooklyn Philharmonic: The election of Mr. de Blasio, a Park Slope resident, has further enshrined Brooklyn as the center of the universe. But even as the borough has become the unstoppably trendy home of $12 million townhouses and world-class cultural institutions like the Brooklyn Academy of Music, it has not been able to sustain a symphony.         \n\nThe Brooklyn Philharmonic has no staff and few financial assets and was reported last month to be  \n. As one composer and Juilliard professor suggested to me recently, the answer may be in short concerts \u2014 around an hour long \u2014 that could tap into the interests of younger audiences and also into the borough\u2019s new money.         \n\n\u25a0 Distinctiveness: This is an admittedly hoary wish, but it seems worth lamenting that the Bloomberg administration did succeed in making New York feel more like London and Mumbai. There are the skinny residential towers (see above) and enormously wealthy transients to fill them.         \n\nBut now, too, comes the news that the departing mayor is going to  \n that will show other cities how to be more like New York. On top of that, there is the market-driven exporting of the Brooklyn ethos to the suburbs and beyond.         \n\nHow do you lure people to New York on the ground that it\u2019s like nowhere else when it feels like everywhere else?
