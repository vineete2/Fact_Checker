{"headline": "Here Is What Happens When You Cast Lindsay Lohan in Your Movie", "body": "\nLindsay Lohan moves through the Chateau Marmont as if she owns the place, but in a debtor-prison kind of way. She\u2019ll soon owe the hotel $46,000. Heads turn subtly as she slinks toward a table to meet a young producer and an old director. The actress\u2019s mother, Dina Lohan, sits at the next table. Mom sweeps blond hair behind her ear and tries to eavesdrop. A few tables away, a distinguished-looking middle-aged man patiently waits for the actress. He has a stack of presents for her.         \n\nLohan sits down, smiles and skips the small talk.         \n\n\u201cHi, how are you? I won\u2019t play Cynthia. I want to play Tara, the lead.\u201d Braxton Pope and  \n nod happily. They\u2019d been tipped off by her agent that this was how it was going to go. They tell her that sounds like a great idea.         \n\nSchrader thinks she\u2019s perfect for the role. Not everyone agrees. Schrader wrote \u201cRaging Bull\u201d and \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d and has directed 17 films. Still, some fear Lohan will end him. There have been house arrests, car crashes and ingested white powders. His own daughter begs him not to use her. A casting-director friend stops their conversation whenever he mentions her name. And then there\u2019s the film\u2019s explicit subject matter. Full nudity and lots of sex. Definitely NC-17. His wife, the actress Mary Beth Hurt, didn\u2019t even finish the script, dismissing it as pornography after 50 pages. She couldn\u2019t understand why he wanted it so badly.         \n\nBut Schrader was running out of chances. His last major opportunity was about a decade ago, when he was picked to direct a reboot of \u201cThe Exorcist.\u201d He told an interviewer, \u201cIf I don\u2019t completely screw that up, it might be possible for me to end my career standing on my own feet rather than groveling for coins.\u201d A few months later, he was replaced by the blockbuster director Renny Harlin, who reshot the film. Renny Harlin! Schrader is now 65 and still begging for coins.         \n\nPope, dressed in a checked shirt and skinny tie, looks like a producer. His fingers are constantly, frantically, scanning his iPhone. In the fall of 2011, he connected Schrader with  \n, whose grisly satires brought him early notoriety and who had lately turned to screenwriting. The three were set to make \u201cBait,\u201d a shark thriller, based on a screenplay Ellis wrote, but the Spanish financing vaporized. Schrader suggested they do something on the cheap that didn\u2019t look cheap. Pope worked his connections with Lohan\u2019s agent, and that\u2019s why she is sitting here on this spring day.         \n\nEllis is noticeably absent, holed up less than a mile away waging one of his frequent Twitter wars. (He has mounted social-media jihads against David Foster Wallace, J. D. Salinger and Kathryn Bigelow.) He thinks Lohan is wrong for the part, especially if she\u2019s cast opposite the porn star he courted online. But he spent all his capital getting his man cast. Also, his condo is under water. Ellis will give in.         \n\nSchrader, Pope and Lohan talk details. The film, \u201cThe Canyons,\u201d has a microbudget, maybe $250,000. Ellis, Pope and Schrader are putting up $30,000 apiece. The rest will be raised on Kickstarter with promises of cameos, script reviews and \u2014 for the low, low price of $10,000 \u2014 the money clip that Robert DeNiro gave Schrader on the set of \u201cTaxi Driver.\u201d There will be no studio looking over their shoulders offering idiot notes. The actress will get $100 a day and an equal share of the profits, but no vote in decision-making. This last clause is nonnegotiable.         \n\nSchrader goes over some ground rules; no trailers on set and one contractually obligated, four-way sex scene. Oh, another thing, Schrader adds: he will not try to sleep with her. This was probably a more relevant point in 1982, but no matter. Lohan stands up and says goodbye, telling everyone how excited she is to be working with them. She leaves the restaurant, followed by her mother and the mysterious man with the presents.         \n\nBack at the table, Pope straightens his tie and exhales. He turns to Schrader\u00ad and asks a simple question.         \n\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d         \n\nSchrader knows he should be terrified, but he\u2019s as giddy as the son of dour Calvinists can be.         \n\n\u201cI think this is going to work.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/magazine/here-is-what-happens-when-you-cast-lindsay-lohan-in-your-movie.html", "date": "2013-01-10", "description": "Paul Schrader, Bret Easton Ellis, Lindsay Lohan and a porn star named James Deen try to make a movie for $250,000 that will save all of their careers.
