{"headline": "Politics and Vetting Leave Key U.S. Posts Long Unfilled", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014  \n is practically home alone at the State Department, toiling without permanent assistant secretaries of state for the Middle East, Asia, Europe and Africa. At the Pentagon, a temporary personnel chief is managing furloughs for 800,000 civilian employees. There has not been a director of the Internal Revenue Service since last November, and it was only on Thursday that  \n announced a nomination for commerce secretary after the job was open for nearly a year.         \n\nAs the White House races this week to plug holes in the cabinet, the lights remain off in essential offices across the administration. The vacancies, attributed to partisan politics and lengthy White House vetting, are slowing policy making in a capital already known for inaction, and embarrassing a president who has had more than five months since his re-election to fill many of the jobs.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever been this bad,\u201d said Representative Frank R. Wolf, Republican of Virginia, who recently wrote a letter urging Mr. Obama to act swiftly to fill top vacancies.         \n\nOne of the worst backlogs is at the State Department, where nearly a quarter of the most senior posts are not filled, including those in charge of embassy security and counterterrorism. The Treasury Department is searching for a new No. 2, the Department of Homeland Security is missing its top two cybersecurity officials and about 30 percent of the top jobs at the Commerce Department are still vacant, including that of chief economist.         \n\nAt the Pentagon, which is helping to lead the administration\u2019s pivot to a greater focus on Asia, the assistant secretary of defense for Asia is about to leave his job.         \n\nMr. Kerry expressed frustration about the State Department vacancies in recent testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, saying he was \u201cstill waiting for the vetting to move\u201d at the White House for people he recommended for jobs \u201cway back in February.\u201d         \n\nBut in a statement to The New York Times, Mr. Kerry said, \u201cI have a new appreciation for how much the confirmation process has become a political football in recent years and what that forces on the vetting process required to announce nominees.\u201d         \n\nAlthough Mr. Kerry said that \u201cthe White House and the administration make the very best out of a tough situation,\u201d who is to blame is a matter of intense debate.         \n\nThe White House faults an increasingly partisan confirmation process in the Senate and what officials say are over-the-top demands for information about every corner of a nominee\u2019s life. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew received 444 questions from senators before his confirmation, more than the seven previous Treasury nominees combined, according to data compiled by the White House. Gina McCarthy, Mr. Obama\u2019s nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, got 1,000 questions from the Senate, White House officials said.         \n\n\u201cCurrent Congressional Republicans have made no secret of the extraordinary lengths they will go to to obstruct the confirmation process,\u201d said Eric Schultz, a White House spokesman. \u201cThat unprecedented evasiveness, often about matters decades old or unrelated to the post, slows down the process from beginning to end.\u201d         \n\nBut members of Congress and a number of agency officials say the bottleneck is at the White House, where nominees remain unannounced as the legal and personnel offices conduct time-consuming background checks aimed at discovering the slightest potential problem that could hold up a confirmation. People who have gone through the vetting in Mr. Obama\u2019s White House describe a grueling process, lasting weeks or months, in which lawyers and political operatives search for anything that might hint at scandal.         \n\nAdministration officials, members of Congress and scholars of the federal appointment process say it is difficult to determine \u2014 short of a six-month-long study \u2014 if Mr. Obama has filled fewer of the roughly 1,200 federal jobs that require Senate confirmation than George W. Bush or Bill Clinton had at this point in their second terms. But there is widespread agreement that an alarming number of important posts in the government\u2019s most senior ranks are vacant or filled with acting deputies with little authority to make decisions.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a weakening of accountability down the chain of command,\u201d said Paul Light, a professor at New York University who has done extensive research on the appointment process. \u201cYou don\u2019t have someone there who has full authority to say \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no.\u2019 The whole system tends to grind down to a very slow crawl.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/03/us/politics/top-posts-remain-vacant-throughout-obama-administration.html", "date": "2013-05-02", "description": "A backlog of vacancies in top posts throughout the Obama administration, especially in the State Department, has slowed policy making in a capital already known for inaction."}
