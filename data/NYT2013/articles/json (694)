Exams were mysteriously missing pages.         \n\nIt might sound like a middle-school math test gone wrong, but it\u2019s a fresh scandal in the Olympics world, implicating as many as 60 experts involved in, of all things, rhythmic gymnastics. The suspected cheats included the test takers who were looking to qualify as official judges as well as their exam proctors.         \n\nRhythmic gymnastics is a much-maligned competition that every four years tends to elicit the same reaction from American viewers \u2014 That\u2019s a sport? \u2014 as they watch pint-size women swirl acrobatically with hoops and ribbons. With its sparkles and hair scrunchies, rhythmic, as it is called by its followers, can look more like modern dance-meets-small-town circus than a traditional Olympic competition.         \n\nThe suspected cheating occurred late last year in testing rooms across Europe, where test takers looked to qualify for elite competition like the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro. The International Gymnastics Federation, known as F.I.G., spent months investigating the episode. Much of their findings, spanning hundreds of pages, were obtained by The New York Times.         \n\nThe documents showed that in Bucharest, Romania, test takers clearly copied answers from one anothers\u2019 papers, including the mistakes. In Moscow, 114 answers were changed on dozens of tests; in Alicante, Spain, 257 answers were changed.         \n\nThe exam sheets themselves served as evidence of the suspected cheating \u2014 crude markups, blatant copying, unexplained bonus points \u2014 that proved as clumsy as a botched rhythmic routine.         \n\nOne test clearly had been touched by more than one person \u2014 it was filled with at least two different handwriting styles, the report said. The documents provided no evidence that the suspected cheating had affected any results in athletic competitions.         \n\nJudging scandals have upended high-profile sports like figure skating and gymnastics before, but this possible cheating episode serves as a reminder that even in the confines of obscure sports, the competition is every bit as cutthroat.         \n\nThe fallout has been swift, with one top Olympic official already expelled and six others suspended. They include Caroline Hunt of the United States, along with officials from Egypt, Japan and Russia. Dozens of judges who took the tests have been implicated and questioned by F.I.G. investigators.         \n\nMs. Hunt plans to appeal the punishment. Her lawyer did not respond to a request for comment, but United States gymnastics officials issued a statement in support of her, saying that the group \u201crecognizes her integrity and commitment to fair play.\u201d         \n\nErik Moers of the Czech Republic, a longtime judge who did not take the suspicious tests and has not been tied to the suspected cheating, said: \u201cThis sport is very ill. It\u2019s poisoned from head to toe.\u201d         \n\nA job judging at the Olympics and other elite competitions is a coveted perch. As the rhythmic gymnasts compete to see who can twist their limbs into the most elaborate pretzel \u2014 while climbing through a hoop \u2014 so too do the judges contort in their own ways.         \n\n\u201cIf their eyes were guns, they\u2019d kill each other,\u201d said Mr. Moers, who has become perhaps the sport\u2019s most vocal critic.         \n\nEarlier this year, Mr. Moers started a petition calling to \u201cban unfair judging and corruption from our beloved sport.\u201d He describes the world of rhythmic gymnastics as one as rife with cronyism as it is with colorful sequins. The sanctions, which were made public last week, have in some ways validated his claims.         \n\nInvestigators found that Maria Szyszkowska of Poland, the former president of the governing body\u2019s rhythmic gymnastics technical committee, interfered with the computer program that calculated the scores. As a result, Mrs. Szyszkowska was stripped of her membership and prohibited from \u201cany form of participation in all F.I.G. events and activities.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/17/sports/olympics/judges-of-a-graceful-sport-caught-in-a-clumsy-cheating-scandal.html", "date": "2013-07-16", "description": "A scandal surrounding the Olympic sport of rhythmic gymnastics has implicated as many as 60 experts of the sport who were looking to qualify as official judges."}
