{"headline": "Senator Persists Battling Health Law, Irking Even Many in His Own Party", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Facing an increasingly likely defeat in his tangled procedural fight over funding the government, Senator Ted Cruz took to the Senate floor on Tuesday and declared he would speak \u201cuntil I cannot stand\u201d to rally voters against the health care law.         \n\nWhile the Senate appeared ready to override him in a preliminary vote scheduled for Wednesday, Mr. Cruz, a freshman Republican from Texas, pressed ahead hour after hour with his opposition, comparing his fight to efforts by leaders who stood against the Nazis, ended the cold war or started the American Revolution.         \n\n\u201cEveryone in America knows Obamacare is destroying the economy,\u201d said Mr. Cruz, who began speaking at 2:41 p.m. and was still at it after 5 a.m.. \u201cWhere is the urgency?\u201d         \n\nYet outside the chamber, his colleagues worked against his efforts to block a vote to take up the House-passed bill that does precisely what he wants: financing the government through mid-December while cutting off money for the Affordable Care Act.         \n\nMr. Cruz called on his colleagues to stonewall the measure they technically supported, arguing that Senate Democrats would be successful in stripping the health care provision from the funding bill once the way was cleared to a Senate vote on the issue. His basic demand was an agreement that a final vote require 60 supporters, a demand Democrats rejected.         \n\nOther Republicans said they saw no reason to oppose debating a measure they actually backed.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019d be hard-pressed to explain why we were opposed to a bill we\u2019re in favor of,\u201d said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader.         \n\nOthers warned of political repercussions if Republicans, who hope to regain control of the Senate in next year\u2019s elections, were seen as contributing to a shuttering of the government. \u201cGetting the majority in the Senate in 2014 is possible, and we don\u2019t want to go down roads that make it harder,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who is up for re-election next year. \u201cRepealing Obamacare is a goal all Republicans share,\u201d he added, \u201cbut the tactics of achieving that goal can have a backlash.\u201d         \n\nMr. Cruz\u2019s lonely stand was not technically a filibuster. The first vote in a long process to get to a final showdown is set for Wednesday, and Mr. Cruz cannot head off that vote. And only a handful of Republicans are expected to join him in voting against taking up the House bill.         \n\n\u201cThere will be no filibuster today,\u201d said Senator Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat and majority leader.         \n\nSenior Senate Republicans pushed Mr. Cruz on Tuesday to give up his stalling tactics and let the Senate take its final votes as soon as possible to strip out the health care language and other policy prescriptions, then approve new language to keep the government operating until mid-November. An early vote would give Speaker John A. Boehner more time to plan his next move: Whether to put the Senate-passed bill up for a vote and ensure no government shutdown or to add new Republican-favored language and send it back to the Senate.         \n\nIf Mr. Cruz persists and forces the Senate to exhaust the time allowed for the necessary votes, the final vote cannot happen until Sunday.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who else in the conference may feel differently, but I do know if the House doesn\u2019t get what we send over there until Monday, they\u2019re in a pretty tough spot,\u201d Mr. McConnell said.         \n\nSome Senate Republicans suggested a quick vote on a stopgap spending measure could allow the House to attach a measure related to the Affordable Care Act but one that could split Democrats and possibly become law. The obvious target would be a tax on medical devices that helps finance the law, but which has strong opponents in both parties. House Republicans are also considering adding a one-year delay in the individual mandate.         \n\nSuch procedural niceties carried little weight with the conservative activists backing Mr. Cruz, and the conservative advocacy groups egging them on. Phone lines were jammed by Cruz supporters. E-mails flew, encouraged by organizations like the  \n and the  \n. The  \n, a group that has been running advertisements attacking Republicans who are not supporting the \u201cdefund Obamacare\u201d effort, called Mr. McConnell and the No. 2 Senate Republican, John Cornyn of Texas, \u201cturncoats.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/25/us/politics/senate-democratic-leader-sets-stage-for-budget-showdown.html", "date": "2013-09-24", "description": "Many Republicans abandoned Senator Ted Cruz in his fight over the health care law, which stretched into the early hours Wednesday morning on the Senate floor."}
