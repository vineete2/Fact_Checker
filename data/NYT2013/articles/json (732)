{"headline": "More Than a Flooded Cellar. A Vintage Mystery.", "body": "\nWineCare marketed itself as a high-security cellar that stores, catalogs and cares for 27,000 cases of wine in the basement of a Manhattan warehouse, charging substantial fees to safeguard collections worth tens of millions of dollars.         \n\nBut there was one problem: the cellar was just 100 yards from the Hudson River. And when  \n struck, the water came rushing in.         \n\nEight months later, WineCare has become the scene of one of the strangest stories to emerge from the storm, a classic Manhattan tale featuring boldfaced names, high-stakes legal battles and top-shelf luxury.         \n\nShortly after the flooding, the owner sent customers a reassuring e-mail: \u201cWe believe at least 95% of the wine we are storing is fine.\u201d         \n\nBut since then, WineCare, which once offered a same-day delivery service from its warehouse in the Chelsea neighborhood, has steadfastly denied customers access to even a single bottle of Ch\u00e2teau Rayas Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape, Kistler chardonnay or Rousseau Chambertin.         \n\nNow, amid concern that century-old bottles have been spoiled or celebrated vintages rendered anonymous by lost labels, some of the city\u2019s most prominent wine collectors \u2014 including Donald Drapkin, a hedge fund manager who estimated the value of his wine collection at $5.2 million \u2014 have sued WineCare, which is now in bankruptcy court.         \n\nHurricane Sandy killed 44 people in New York City and damaged or destroyed 305,000 homes in New York State alone, making the October storm one of the most destructive ever to strike the United States. So despite the extraordinary prices associated with the bottles in peril, the fate of a cellar of expensive wines has not elicited much public sympathy.         \n\nEven the federal judge hearing the case scolded lawyers for the wine owners for their level of urgency. \u201cThere were thousands of victims of Hurricane Sandy,\u201d he said, \u201cmost of which suffered a great deal more than your clients have.\u201d         \n\nBut trying to ascertain the fate of the wine has become a relentless crusade for some of the owners and a matter of fascination within the ranks of wine collectors.         \n\n\u201cEveryone in the New York wine world is aware of it,\u201d said Jamie Ritchie, president of Sotheby\u2019s Wine, an auction house.         \n\nMeanwhile, Derek L. Limbocker, a onetime investment banker and society figure who founded WineCare and made it into one of the country\u2019s largest wine-storage facilities, has publicly maintained that a vast majority of wine under his care is safe.         \n\nHe did not return calls requesting comment.         \n\nBut, under questioning at a creditors\u2019 meeting in March, Mr. Limbocker revealed that floodwaters and humidity lifted the labels off as many as 100 cases; cardboard boxes containing the wines disintegrated, and thousands of bottles broke as they were lugged up or down the stairwells of the warehouse.         \n\nCustomers do not know the extent of the damage, because their repeated requests to view video from the round-the-clock, 16-channel surveillance system featured in the marketing materials have been denied.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the craziest thing I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said William C. Carmody, a trial lawyer who stored about 29 cases of wine at WineCare that he says are worth $104,000. \u201cI\u2019m still being charged a monthly fee. But you can never get a straight answer.\u201d         \n\nIn January, one day before Philip Waterman III, a real estate investor with $300,000 worth of wine at WineCare, was to conduct a court-ordered inspection of his 198 cases of wine, Mr. Limbocker blocked the maneuver by filing for bankruptcy protection.         \n\nHis lawyer, Lawrence V. Gelber, later told the court he needed \u201ca proverbial breathing spell.\u201d         \n\nMr. Waterman, Mr. Drapkin and others recently filed a motion asking the United States Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan to appoint a trustee to oversee WineCare and block the company\u2019s pending move to a warehouse in Jersey City.         \n\nThey said in a legal brief that they had \u201clost faith in Derek Limbocker\u2019s judgment, his management ability, and, most importantly, his integrity.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/22/nyregion/a-vintage-mystery-in-a-flooded-wine-cellar.html", "date": "2013-07-21", "description": "A Manhattan cellar where 27,000 cases of wine were stored was flooded during Hurricane Sandy, and collectors blocked from assessing the damage have sued."}
