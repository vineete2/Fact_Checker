{"headline": "Mets\u2019 Alderson Can Finally Spend, Assuming He Wants To", "body": "\nFor three years,  \n General Manager  \n has tried building a roster on a limited budget. At a clear disadvantage, he faced small expectations, as if batting with one hand tied behind his back and staring at Matt Harvey on the mound. He had to take a few weak swings and hope for the best, until more money came off the books.         \n\nNow the Mets swear they can spend again. Alderson could have about $35 million and a blank slate as he attends the general managers\u2019 meetings this week in Orlando, Fla. Only David Wright, Jon Niese, Dillon Gee and Zack Wheeler appear to be guaranteed roster spots. The other 21 should be up to Alderson.         \n\nThat, of course, also means that Alderson has a lot of holes to fill. He has said he wants to find a corner outfielder, a shortstop, maybe a pitcher. There is a logjam at first base that must play out. The Mets\u2019 spare parts could be traded. Alderson might finally be able to take a healthy swing. But it would be a bigger letdown now if he misses.         \n\nLast season, like the two before, he was forced to scan the bargain bin for aging veterans, most of whom carried some risk. With uncertain finances, the Mets\u2019 payroll had dropped by about $50 million during his tenure. He signed about a dozen veterans to minor league deals. All of them eventually played a role with the team.         \n\nTo Alderson\u2019s credit, he has unearthed a few gems over the last three years.         \n\nMarlon Byrd was one of the dozen. He was suspended 50 games in 2012 for testing positive for a performance-enhancing drug, but he batted in the middle of the Mets\u2019 order last season, hitting 21 homers and driving in 71 runs. He played so well that he was packaged in a late-season trade that returned Dilson Herrera, a young shortstop prospect, and Vic Black, a promising young reliever.         \n\nThe season before, Alderson brought back Scott Hairston on his second one-year deal, worth about $1.1 million. Hairston hit 20 home runs, a career high, good for third most on the team, and parlayed that into a two-year deal with the Chicago Cubs.         \n\nThe season before, Alderson took a chance on Chris Capuano, who had had two Tommy John elbow operations and made nine starts in three years. Alderson signed him to a one-year deal worth about $1.5 million. Capuano made 31 starts, finished tied for second on the team with 11 victories and then signed a two-year deal worth about $10 million with the Los Angeles Dodgers.         \n\nThis was the cyclical nature of free agency: Players, given the chance, would prove their worth and play themselves out of the Mets\u2019 price range.         \n\nThe best, most rewarding moves have resulted from Alderson\u2019s shopping two attractive trade chips, and being in a position of power. For trading Carlos Beltran, he got Wheeler. For trading R. A. Dickey and a few parts, he got another potential front-line starter (Noah Syndergaard), a catcher for the future (Travis d\u2019Arnaud), another prospect (Wuilmer Becerra) and a veteran catcher (John Buck). Buck hit 15 home runs last season before being traded with Byrd.         \n\nThe Mets could make another trade this off-season, if perhaps Alderson is bold enough to move his star prospects. Ike Davis, Lucas Duda or Daniel Murphy could also be dealt. They were not among the four \u2014 Wright, Niese, Gee, and Wheeler \u2014 reportedly deemed safe by Jeff Wilpon, the team\u2019s chief operating officer.         \n\nMets fans can at least dream about prying Brandon Phillips from Cincinnati, Carlos Gonzalez or Troy Tulowitzki from Colorado or David Price from Tampa Bay.         \n\nMaking a trade may be wiser. The players at the top of the free-agent market, those who could make a difference for the Mets \u2014 Robinson Cano, Jacoby Ellsbury, Shin-Soo Choo \u2014 are probably out of their price range. Ellsbury or Choo would fit nicely atop the Mets\u2019 lineup, but both are flawed. Choo struggles against left-handed pitching, and Ellsbury is injury prone.         \n\nStill, both should command contracts in excess of $100 million.         \n\nAlderson has said that the Mets would spend substantial money for the right player. But it seems unlikely, given the number of areas he needs to address. There is a better chance he will go bargain shopping again, just in a higher-end aisle.         \n\nFor a shortstop, Jhonny Peralta may have been suspended as part of the Biogenesis scandal, but he hit .333 in the playoffs for Detroit upon his return. Also, Stephen Drew could be a pricey fit, after having a nice season for the champion Boston Red Sox.         \n\nFor outfielders, Beltran and Curtis Granderson are intriguing options. But Beltran will turn 37 in April, and Granderson is coming off an injury-riddled season.         \n\nAdding Corey Hart of the Milwaukee Brewers, a first baseman/outfielder, would bring power. He missed all of last season with injuries to his knees but averaged 29 home runs his three previous seasons.         \n\nThen there is always the possibility Alderson will stand pat. Maybe he will decide a trade would cost too much and no free agent is worth an expensive multiyear deal. Perhaps he will add a player or two, bide his time and save money until Harvey recovers from Tommy John surgery and the team is ready to contend.         \n\nThe Mets have endured three losing seasons under Alderson, though, waiting for this moment, waiting to go for it. Waiting some more would take exceptional patience.
