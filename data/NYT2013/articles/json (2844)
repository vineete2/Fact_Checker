{"headline": "Far-Off Planets Like the Earth Dot the Galaxy", "body": "\nThe known odds of something \u2014 or someone \u2014 living far, far away from Earth improved beyond astronomers\u2019 boldest dreams on Monday.         \n\nAstronomers reported that there could be as many as 40 billion habitable Earth-size planets in the galaxy, based on a new analysis of data from  \n.         \n\nOne out of every five sunlike stars in the galaxy has a planet the size of Earth circling it in the Goldilocks zone \u2014 not too hot, not too cold \u2014 where surface temperatures should be compatible with liquid water, according to a herculean three-year calculation based on data from the Kepler spacecraft by  \n, a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley.         \n\nMr. Petigura\u2019s analysis represents a major step toward the main goal of the Kepler mission, which was to measure what fraction of sunlike stars in the galaxy have Earth-size planets. Sometimes called eta-Earth, it is an important factor in the so-called  \n used to estimate the number of intelligent civilizations in the universe. Mr. Petigura\u2019s paper, published Monday in the journal  \n, puts another smiley face on a cosmos that has gotten increasingly friendly and fecund-looking over the last 20 years.         \n\n\u201cIt seems that the universe produces plentiful real estate for life that somehow resembles life on Earth,\u201d Mr. Petigura said.         \n\nOver the last two decades, astronomers have logged more than 1,000 planets around other stars, so-called exoplanets, and Kepler, in its four years of life before being  \n last winter, has compiled a list of some 3,500 more candidates. The new result could steer plans in the next few years and decades to find a twin of the Earth \u2014 Earth 2.0, in the argot \u2014 that is close enough to here to study.         \n\nThe nearest such planet might be only 12 light-years away. \u201cSuch a star would be visible to the naked eye,\u201d Mr. Petigura said.         \n\nHis result builds on a report earlier this year by David Charbonneau and Courtney Dressing of the  \n, who found that about 15 percent of the smaller and more numerous stars known as red dwarfs have Earth-like planets in their habitable zones. Using slightly less conservative assumptions, Ravi Kopparapu of Pennsylvania State University found that half of all red dwarfs have such planets.         \nGalaxy contains billions of potentially habitable planets, say University of California at Berkeley and University of Hawaii at Manoa astronomers. \n\nGeoffrey Marcy of the University of California, Berkeley, who supervised Mr. Petigura\u2019s research and was a co-author of the paper along with Andrew Howard of the University of Hawaii, said: \u201cThis is the most important work I\u2019ve ever been involved with. This is it. Are there inhabitable Earths out there?\u201d         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling a little tingly,\u201d he said.         \n\nAt a news conference Friday discussing the results, astronomers erupted in praise of the Kepler mission and its team.  \n, a Kepler leader from the NASA Ames Research Center, described the project and its members as \u201cthe best of humanity rising to the occasion.\u201d         \n\nAccording to Mr. Petigura\u2019s new calculation, the fraction of stars with Earth-like planets is 22 percent, plus or minus 8 percent, depending on exactly how you define the habitable zone.         \n\nThere are several caveats. Although these planets are Earth-size, nobody knows what their masses are and thus whether they are rocky like the Earth, or balls of ice or gas, let alone whether anything can, or does \u2014 or ever will \u2014 live on them.         \n\nThere is reason to believe, from recent observations of other worlds, however, that at least some Earth-size planets, if not all of them, are indeed rocky. Last week, two groups of astronomers announced that an  \n that orbits its sun in 8.5 hours has the same density as the Earth, though it is too hot to support life.         \n\n\u201cNature,\u201d as Mr. Petigura put it, \u201cknows how to make rocky Earth-size planets.\u201d         \n\nAlso, the number is more uncertain than it might have been because Kepler\u2019s pointing system failed before it could complete its prime survey. As a result, Mr. Petigura and his colleagues had to extrapolate from planets slightly larger than Earth and with slightly smaller, tighter orbits. For the purposes of his analysis \u201cEarth-size\u201d was anything from one to two times the diameter of the Earth, and Earth-like orbits were between 400 and 200 days.         \n\nDr. Batalha said, \u201cWe don\u2019t yet have any planet candidates that are exact analogues of the Earth in terms of size, orbit or star type.\u201d         \n\nThough  \n while astronomers devise a new program it can accomplish with less flexible pointing ability, it has sent back so much data that there is still a whole year\u2019s worth of results left to analyze, Dr. Batalha said. \u201cScientists,\u201d she said, \u201care going to work on Kepler data for decades.\u201d Kepler was launched in 2009 to perform a kind of cosmic census, monitoring the brightness of 150,000 far-off stars in the Cygnus and Lyra constellations, looking for dips in brightness when planets pass in front of them.         \n\nMr. Petigura and his colleagues restricted themselves to a subset of some 42,000 brighter and well-behaved stars. They found 603 planets, of which 10 were between one Earth and two Earths in diameter, and circled in what Mr. Petigura defined as the habitable zone, where they would receive between a quarter of the light the Earth gets, and four times as much. In the solar system, that zone would spread from inside the orbit of Venus to just outside the orbit of Mars.         \n\nMeanwhile, in an innovation borrowed from other data-intensive fields like particle physics, Mr. Petigura designed a computer pipeline so that he could inject fake planets into the data \u2014 40,000 in all \u2014 and see how efficiently his program could detect planets of different sizes and orbits. In addition to that correction, he and his colleagues had to correct for geometry; only about one in 100 planet systems is aligned edge-on so that earthlings would see the telltale wink of an exoplanet transit.         \n\n\u201cIt was a ton of work,\u201d he recalled, explaining that he had to try out tens of billions of different periods for each star in order to find planets.         \n\nSara Seager, an exoplanet astronomer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was not involved in the work, said the pipeline testing had made the results believable. \u201cI would say that small planets are everywhere and very common,\u201d she said, \u201cno matter how you slice and dice the data. But Kepler is dead and we have no way to get any further data. So we\u2019ll have to be satisfied with this as the final word, for now.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/science/cosmic-census-finds-billions-of-planets-that-could-be-like-earth.html", "date": "2013-11-04", "description": "With the help of the Kepler spacecraft, astronomers calculate the number of habitable Earth-like planets in the Goldilocks zone \u2014 not too hot, not too cold."}
