Now, Mark Zuckerberg, its co-founder and chief executive, wants to make a play for the rest \u2014 including the four billion or so who lack Internet access.         \n\nOn Wednesday, Facebook  \n aimed at drastically cutting the cost of delivering basic Internet services on mobile phones, particularly in developing countries, where Facebook and other tech companies need to find new users. Half a dozen of the world\u2019s tech giants, including Samsung, Nokia, Qualcomm and Ericsson, have agreed to work with the company as partners on the initiative, which they call  \n.         \n\nThe companies intend to accomplish their goal in part by  \n and by improving the components of phones and networks so that they transmit more data while using less battery power.         \n\nFor Mr. Zuckerberg, the formation of the coalition is yet another way in which he is trying to position himself as an industry leader. He has been speaking out more forcefully than other tech executives on topics like immigration overhaul, which the industry sees as critical to its hiring needs. With Internet.org, he is  \n that tries to pair humanitarian goals with the profit motive.         \n\n\u201cThe Internet is such an important thing for driving humanity forward, but it\u2019s not going to build itself,\u201d he said in a recent interview. \u201cUltimately, this has to make business sense on some time frame that people can get behind.\u201d         \n\nBut the effort is also a reflection of how tech companies are trying to meet Wall Street\u2019s demands for growth by attracting customers beyond saturated markets in the United States and Europe, even if they have to help build services and some of the infrastructure in poorer, less digitally sophisticated parts of the world.         \n\nGoogle, for example, began a  \n that offers wireless users in some developing countries free access to Gmail, search and the first page clicked through from a search\u2019s results. Google is also reaching for the sky with  \n, an attempt to beam Internet access down to earth from plastic balloons floating more than 11 miles in the atmosphere.         \n\nTwitter, which is preparing to offer shares to the public in an initial stock offering, has struck its own deals with about 250 cellphone companies in more than 100 countries to offer some free Twitter access, and worked to make sure its service is easy to use on even the cheapest cellphones.         \n\nThese companies have little choice but to look overseas for growth. More than half of Americans already use Facebook at least once a month, for instance, and usage in the rest of the developed world is similarly heavy. There is nearly one active cellphone for every person on earth, making expansion a challenge for carriers and phone makers.         \n\nPoorer countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America present the biggest opportunity to reach new customers \u2014 if companies can figure out how to get people there online at low cost.         \n\nThe immediate goals of the new coalition are to cut the cost of providing mobile Internet services to 1 percent of its current level within five to 10 years by improving the efficiency of Internet networks and mobile phone software. The group also hopes to develop new business models that would allow phone companies to provide simple services like e-mail, search and social networks for little or no charge.         \n\nWhile that sounds far less exciting than, say, Google\u2019s idea of delivering the Internet by balloon, Mr. Zuckerberg says small efforts can add up to big changes.         \n\n\u201cNo one company can really do this by itself,\u201d he said.         \n\nFacebook is already working on techniques to reduce the average amount of data used by its Android mobile app from the current 12 megabytes a day to 1 megabyte without users noticing.         \n\nQualcomm, whose chip technology is prevalent in advanced cellphones, has created new designs to stretch a phone\u2019s battery life, slice the amount of data needed to transmit a video and extend the reach of mobile networks through tiny devices similar to Wi-Fi routers.         \n\nThe coalition partners have also begun trying new ways of reducing the data charges paid by cellphone customers while still enabling phone makers and carriers to make money.         \n\nFor example, Nokia, the Finnish cellphone maker, ran a recent experiment with Facebook and the Mexican phone carrier Telcel, in which it bundled free Facebook access with some of its Asha feature phones. Sales rose significantly, and the company decided to run similar promotions for customers of Bharti Airtel, a mobile carrier in India and Africa.         \n\nHowever, the Internet.org team does not plan to tackle some thorny infrastructure issues that are huge barriers in the developing world, particularly the long-distance transmission of data to far-flung places.         \n\nMichuki Mwangi, regional development manager for Africa at the Internet Society, a nonprofit group that has long worked to expand global Internet access, said the continent sorely lacked local interconnection points, forcing most requests for content like YouTube videos to be routed through Europe at high cost. Creating more connection points would require navigating a thicket of government interests and powerful incumbents. But at the very least, the group would like Facebook and Google to put copies of their content on a greater number of African servers to deliver it more quickly and cheaply, something that both companies say they are considering.
