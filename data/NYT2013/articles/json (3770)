{"headline": "Free Cable for Building Managers, but With Fine Print", "body": "\nTom Hogan misses the History Channel.         \n\nAs the superintendent of a Manhattan condominium building, Mr. Hogan enjoyed a significant discount on his  \n bill for more than a decade, a fairly standard perk for resident managers around the city. In exchange, he understood his role to be giving repair crews access when they needed it, calling the company when problems arose and doing other things of a ho-hum nature.         \n\nThen, just a few months ago, he said, he finally saw the agreement in writing.         \n\nMr. Hogan received his first contract for Time Warner\u2019s Apartment Managers\u2019 Program, he said. It required him to snoop on condo owners in his building to ensure they were not stealing cable, and demanded that he allow Time Warner employees access to promote new products in the building.         \n\n\u201cI looked at this and I thought, \u2018This looks like double dipping,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Hogan recounted. \u201cI can\u2019t do this.\u201d         \n\nHe refused to sign, and his cable was cut off.         \n\nSome cable companies around the country have long offered free or discounted service to superintendents, and if anybody has vociferous objections to the practice in general, they are difficult to find. But in recent years, as Time Warner Cable has increasingly formalized these longstanding deals, concerns have bubbled up that parts of its program deputize the employees of apartment buildings to carry out Time Warner\u2019s business, thus creating a conflict for building superintendents: Ultimately, which master will you serve?         \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an employee of 77 Park Avenue Condominium, yet you\u2019re being asked to do all these things for another entity,\u201d said  \n, the condo board president of Mr. Hogan\u2019s building. \u201cIt\u2019s blurring the line of responsibility.\u201d         \n\nZiggy Chau, a spokeswoman for Time Warner Cable, said the arrangement was common in the industry and done for customers\u2019 benefit. If they have a direct contact in the building, they can make repairs faster, she pointed out, so residents can make a swift return to their favorite shows and their Internet addictions. (She also pointed out that theft of cable service is, in fact, stealing.)         \n\n\u201cIf there are service issues, customers want those issues fixed yesterday,\u201d Ms. Chau said.         \n\n\u201cThe people in these programs, they\u2019re not going to do it for free. We\u2019re building a good relationship.\u201d         \n\nWhile the Apartment Managers contract has been in existence for years, it seems that in many instances the only thing supers truly needed to get a cable discount was a letter from the building\u2019s management company saying that they were, in fact, supers and that they lived in such-and-such apartment.         \n\nBut over the past two years, Time Warner has been making an effort to comply with new federal tax legislation, Ms. Chau said, and it appears that has meant a stepped-up commitment to paperwork. They have pushed harder to get contracts signed, and sent out W-9 tax forms so the discounts supers receive are better accounted for.         \n\n\u201cYou have to be very careful about what you sign,\u201d said  \n, president of Midboro Management, a large building management company.         \n\nMany of the duties outlined in the Time Warner Apartment Managers Program contract \u2014 available to resident managers, superintendents\u2019 assistants and owners \u2014 are perfectly vanilla, and plenty of real estate professionals have no objection to the arrangement. Resident managers are asked to help coordinate the visits of work crews, for example, and to make sure they can get in the building. In exchange, they get free cable TV service, including an assortment of channels (HBO and Showtime among them), and a discounted rate on Internet and phone service.         \n\nBut Mr. Wolfe is wary of clauses that allow \u201cthe presentation of new products and services\u201d in the building, as well as additional program incentives that reward every three leads that turn into sales with a free month of Internet.         \n\n\u201cWe would consider that a borderline kickback,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, what are they going to be selling next, Tupperware? They work for the building. They\u2019re not an agent for anybody else.\u201d         \n\nMidboro allows its supers to sign the contract but limits the agreement with a letter that prohibits Time Warner from activities like setting up a tower of fliers in the lobby. Mr. Wolfe said Time Warner had been flexible.         \n\nThen there is the requirement that superintendents \u201cidentify, discourage and report\u201d instances of cable theft or tampering with equipment. In essence, this instructs them to fink on people who are simultaneously their neighbors and their employers.         \n\n\u201cVery creepy,\u201d Mr. Wolfe said.         \n\nAfter declining to sign the contract, Mr. Hogan, the resident manager, has had to look for contentment elsewhere, and he says he has found it in the form of another low-cost but, at least on Park Avenue, much more exotic accessory. He went to Radio Shack and bought his television a pair of rabbit ears.
