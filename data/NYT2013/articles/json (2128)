{"headline": "Long on Cutting Edge of Print, New York Magazine Cuts Back", "body": "\nSince its founding in 1968, New York magazine has served as a prototype of literate, high-tempo publishing, using its weekly cadence and location in one of the world\u2019s cultural capitals to usher in a new, more intimate and frank approach to what a publication could be.         \n\nUsing the tenets of so-called New Journalism, the magazine helped popularize the knowing, skeptical voices of writers including Tom Wolfe, Jimmy Breslin, Gloria Steinem and Nora Ephron. It was the birthplace of both Ms. Magazine and the concept of \u201cradical chic.\u201d         \n\nNow, this magazine that has been at the vanguard of Manhattan publishing for almost five decades is acknowledging that the cutting edge is not necessarily a lucrative, or sustainable proposition, at least on the same schedule.         \n\nBeginning in March, New York will retreat from its long-standing status as a weekly and come out every other week instead.         \n\nAlong with the closing of the printed Newsweek and the planned spin-off of Time Inc., which includes the weeklies Time and People, the move to bi-weekly publishing represents the end of an era and underscores the dreary economics of print and its diminishing role in a future that\u2019s already here.         \n\nThe change will beget misty eyes from magazine geeks \u2014 myself among them \u2014 while other consumers will shrug and dive into the ever-changing web version of New York magazine that shows up in their browser.         \n\nThe weekly schedule of New York has already been squeezed, so that the magazine comes out only 42 weeks a year. Soon it will be 26 times a year, with three additional special issues \u2014 best doctors, the annual gift guide and a food-and-drink issue.         \n\nSo will the world, or even just that of New York publishing, tip over because there are 13 fewer issues? No, but something palpable and intrinsically thrilling will be lost with the change in rhythm to a magazine that has been hitting the streets on a weekly basis for more than four decades.         \n\nAdam Moss, New York\u2019s editor in chief, acknowledges it is a bit of a moment. But last week he confidently detailed the logic as he stood in the conference room of the magazine\u2019s lower Manhattan offices, showing off poster boards displaying alternative concepts for the cover, redesigned interior sections and a more visually driven approach to telling stories.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve talked about this for a while and you can\u2019t help but get wistful about it,\u201d he said as Lawrence C. Burstein, the magazine\u2019s publisher, and Michael Silberman, general manager of the online operation, listened. \u201cBut I would be more concerned if we didn\u2019t address how the market and people\u2019s reading habits have changed. I would not be doing this if I didn\u2019t believe we could make a better magazine and continue to grow what we do both in print and online.\u201d         \n\nThe punishing economics of being a stand-alone weekly can be explained in one word: Newsweek.         \n\nThe cost structure at a weekly makes the drop in ads across the industry an existential threat and, as happened at Newsweek, its benefactor is no longer in the picture: Bruce Wasserstein bought New York in 2004 and  \n.         \n\nBy all accounts his heirs are dedicated owners, but they know as well as anyone that Newsweek sold for $1 in 2010 and, after its new owner Sidney Harman died, limped along in a doomed merger with The Daily Beast until it ceased print publication last year. They and the people who work for them are trying to avoid that fate.         \n\nJournalistically, New York magazine has prospered, winning a string of big awards on the way to being named Magazine of the Year in 2013 by the American Society of Magazine Editors. But that doesn\u2019t pay the bills, a job that increasingly falls to the website, which includes  \n,  \n,  \n and  \n. Digital revenues have been growing at a rate of 15 percent year-over-year, and in the coming year will surpass print advertising revenues, according to Mr. Burstein. But part of the reason those lines are crossing is that the print revenues are plummeting.         \n\nNew York, with a current subscriber base just above 400,000, according to the Alliance for Audited Media, got clobbered after the 2008 recession when classified ads went missing and stayed that way. So far this year, the magazine is down 9.2 percent in ad pages compared with the same period last year, which was miserable as well.         \n\nThe brand New York is hardly dying. New York magazine\u2019s web traffic grew 19 percent in the last eight months, to more than nine million unique visitors a month, according to comScore. But to keep up that rate of growth in a competitive set that includes publicly held companies like The New York Times and upstarts like the venture-capital backed online news site BuzzFeed, the magazine had to reduce costs to find the money to fund the part of the business that is growing.
