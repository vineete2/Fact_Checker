{"headline": "This Man Is Not a Cyborg. Yet.", "body": "\nGET right up close to Dmitry Itskov and sniff all you like \u2014 you will not pick up even the faintest hint of crazy. He is soft-spoken and a bit shy, but expansive once he gets talking, and endearingly mild-mannered. He never seems ruffled, no matter what question you ask. Even if you ask the obvious one, which he has encountered more than a few times since 2011, when he started \u201cthis project,\u201d as he sometimes calls it.         \n\nNamely: Are you insane?         \n\n\u201cI hear that often,\u201d he said with a smile, over lunch one recent afternoon in Manhattan. \u201cThere are quotes from people like Arthur C. Clarke and Gandhi saying that when people come up with new ideas they\u2019re called \u2018nuts.\u2019 Then everybody starts believing in the idea and nobody can remember a time when it seemed strange.\u201d         \n\nIt is hard to imagine a day when the ideas championed by Mr. Itskov, 32, a Russian multimillionaire and former online media magnate, will not seem strange, or at least far-fetched and unfeasible. His project, called the 2045 Initiative, for the year he hopes it is completed, envisions the mass production of lifelike, low-cost avatars that can be uploaded with the contents of a human brain, complete with all the particulars of consciousness and personality.         \n\nWhat Mr. Itskov is striving for makes wearable computers, like Google Glass, seem as about as futuristic as Lincoln Logs. This would be a digital copy of your mind in a nonbiological carrier, a version of a fully sentient person that could live for hundreds or thousands of years. Or longer. Mr. Itskov unabashedly drops the word \u201cimmortality\u201d into conversation.         \n\nYes, we have seen this movie and, yes, it always leads to evil robots enslaving humanity, the Earth reduced to smoldering ruins. And it\u2019s quite possible that Mr. Itskov\u2019s plans, in the fullness of time, will prove to be nothing more than sci-fi bunk.         \n\nBut he has the attention, and in some cases the avid support, of august figures at Harvard, M.I.T. and Berkeley and leaders in fields like molecular genetics, neuroprosthetics and other realms that you\u2019ve probably never heard of. Roughly 30 speakers from these and other disciplines will appear at the second annual  \n on June 15 and 16 at Alice Tully Hall, in Lincoln Center in Manhattan.         \n\nThough billed as a congress, the event is more like a showcase and conference that is open to the public, with general admission tickets starting at $750. (About 400 tickets, roughly half the total available, have been sold so far.) Attendees will hear people like Sir Roger Penrose, an emeritus professor of mathematical physics at Oxford, who appears on the  \n Web site with a video teaser about  \n and George M. Church, a genetics professor at Harvard Medical School, whose video on the site concerns  \n         \n\nAs these videos suggest, scientists are taking tiny, incremental steps toward melding humans and machine all the time. Ray Kurzweil, the futurist and now Google\u2019s director of engineering, argued in \u201cThe Singularity Is Near,\u201d a 2005 book, that technology is advancing exponentially and that \u201chuman life will be irreversibly transformed\u201d to the point that there will be no difference between \u201chuman and machine or between physical and virtual reality.\u201d         \n\nMr. Kurzweil was projecting based on the scientific and intellectual ferment of the time. And technological achievements have continued their march since he wrote the book \u2014 from creating computers that can that can outplay humans (like Watson, the \u201cJeopardy\u201d winner from I.B.M.) to technology that tracks a game player\u2019s heartbeat and perhaps his excitement (like the new Kinect) to digital tools for those with disabilities (like brain implants that can help quadriplegics move robotic arms).         \n\nBut most researchers do not aspire to upload our minds to cyborgs; even in this crowd, the concept is a little out there. Academics seem to regard Mr. Itskov as sincere and well-intentioned, and if he wants play global cheerleader for fields that generally toil in obscurity, fine. Ask participants in the 2045 conference if Mr. Itskov\u2019s dreams could ultimately be realized and you\u2019ll hear everything from lukewarm versions of \u201cmaybe\u201d to flat-out enthusiasm.         \n\n\u201cI have a rule against saying something is impossible unless it violates laws of physics,\u201d Professor Church says, adding about Mr. Itskov: \u201cI just think that there\u2019s a lot of dots that aren\u2019t connected in his plans. It\u2019s not a real road map.\u201d         \n\n \n, another speaker at the coming conference and founder of United Therapeutics, a biotech company that makes cardiovascular products, sounds more optimistic.         \n\n\u201cThis is no more wild than in the early \u201860s, when we saw the advent of liver and kidney transplants,\u201d Ms. Rothblatt says. \u201cPeople said at the time, \u2018This is totally crazy.\u2019 Now, about 400 people have organs transplanted every day.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/business/dmitry-itskov-and-the-avatar-quest.html", "date": "2013-06-01", "description": "The Russian multimillionaire Dmitry Itskov wants us all to live forever, our minds inside avatars.
