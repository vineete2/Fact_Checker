{"headline": "Anxiety Over Future of Bike Lanes", "body": "\nDuring Mayor  \n\u2019s tenure, New York City has become a cycling haven, with sprawling lanes across each borough and a bike-share program set to begin this spring.         \n\nBut as Mr. Bloomberg is to leave office at year\u2019s end, there is widespread concern among cyclists that a reckoning awaits, and that the city\u2019s next mayor may end this period of bike-friendly programs and policies.         \n\nIn the early stages of the campaign for mayor, the candidates have expressed little enthusiasm about the expansion of bike lanes, and a few have made comments that suggest they may seek to erase some of them.         \n\nThe concern is noted even in the Bloomberg administration, where some speak of invisible countdown clocks in every city office, reminding officials of the dwindling time to complete projects.         \n\n\u201cThree-hundred and twenty-nine days,\u201d Janette Sadik-Khan, the city\u2019s transportation commissioner, said in a recent interview. \u201cThere\u2019s an app where you can have it on your phone.\u201d         \n\nIn  \n by The New York Times in August, 66 percent of New Yorkers said the bike lanes were a good idea; 27 percent called them a bad idea.         \n\nAsked about the candidates\u2019 apparent reticence on bikes, Ms. Sadik-Khan said, \u201cA lot of people would like to see their numbers polling like bike lanes.\u201d         \n\nAnd yet, cycling advocates find themselves straining to persuade any prospective successor to Mr. Bloomberg to expand upon, or even to preserve, the gains made under his watch.         \n\n \n, the city\u2019s comptroller and a likely Democratic candidate for mayor, said in a phone interview that removing existing lanes would be \u201ca likely scenario in some parts of the city,\u201d particularly in Brooklyn and Queens, if he succeeded Mr. Bloomberg.         \n\nWhile calling himself \u201can avid bike rider,\u201d Mr. Liu expressed skepticism about the polling numbers on bikes. \u201cIt depends who\u2019s doing the poll,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t recall any opponents of bike lanes conducting any polls.\u201d         \n\nJoseph J. Lhota, the former chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and a Republican candidate for mayor, also said he \u201ccould see\u201d removing lanes that he deemed problematic. He noted that some bus drivers along the B63 route in Park Slope, Brooklyn, had complained about the perils of sharing space with bike riders.         \n\nIn recent weeks, two of the Democratic front-runners in the race for mayor,  \n and  \n, have faced criticism for their public comments on bikes.         \n\nIn January, Ms. Quinn, the City Council speaker,  \n that she placed bike lanes \u201cin the category of things you shouldn\u2019t discuss at dinner parties,\u201d alongside money, politics and religion.         \n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a funny joke,\u201d she said in an interview on Thursday, adding that now \u201cit\u2019ll be completely dead as material.\u201d         \n\nMr. de Blasio, the city\u2019s public advocate, drew the ire of bicyclists last week after  \n with The Brooklyn Paper. Where bike lanes have worked, he said, \u201cgreat, let\u2019s keep them,\u201d but \u201cwhere they haven\u2019t worked, let\u2019s revise them or change them.\u201d He also suggested that the city should consult \u201cactual evidence, not biased evidence\u201d in appraising the effectiveness of its lanes.         \n\nPaul Steely White, the executive director of  \n, a group that has gained considerable influence in the Bloomberg years, attributed the candidates\u2019 positions on bikes to political \u201claziness.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this meme, this myth, that Bloomberg has crammed bike lanes down people\u2019s throat,\u201d Mr. White said. \u201cI get that Bill de Blasio and others are striving to distinguish themselves from Bloomberg. My advice to them is to pick another issue.\u201d         \n\nHoward Wolfson, a deputy mayor, also suggested on Thursday that any mayoral hopeful would be unwise to reignite a settled debate, saying, \u201cThe great bike war is over, and the opponents lost.\u201d         \n\nThere are signs that some candidates have begun tacking toward a softer stance. Cyclists remember William C. Thompson Jr., a former comptroller and a likely Democratic candidate, for pledging, during a 2009 campaign against Mr. Bloomberg, to rip out a bike lane on Grand Street if he was elected. In an interview last week, he said he had no intention of removing lanes, and added that he would even consider expanding bike projects if the bike-share program, scheduled to begin in May, proved successful.         \n\nIn her remarks to WNYC, Ms. Quinn called the city\u2019s lanes \u201cclearly controversial,\u201d and said that some had been constructed \u201cwithout consultation with communities and community boards.\u201d         \n\nBut Ms. Quinn said last week that the Transportation Department had begun to work more collaboratively with neighborhoods on bike lanes since the City Council passed a law in 2011 requiring the department to \u201chold hearings with affected community boards before a bicycle lane is constructed or removed.\u201d         \n\nMs. Quinn also said she supported cycling in general, and rode occasionally near her weekend home in New Jersey. \u201cMy district is crazy for bike lanes,\u201d she said.         \n\nIn a statement this week, Mr. de Blasio said that he wanted to see bike lanes expanded, but that the city \u201cstill hasn\u2019t come around to proactively engaging those who are concerned by them.\u201d         \n\nIn the city\u2019s history, Gracie Mansion has had a checkered record on cycling. Mayor Edward I. Koch, inspired by a trip to Beijing,  \n of his own in 1980, but later removed them. In 1987, he  \n on sections of Park, Madison and Fifth Avenues during many weekday business hours.         \n\nEven now, support is rarely unanimous. At a recent community board meeting on extending a lane on Columbus Avenue, a 10-year-old boy named Oscar told the crowd that he and his younger brother needed a safe way to bike to school.         \n\nThe crowd cheered, the boy smiled, and a woman near the back of the room slumped in her chair.         \n\n\u201cOh, God,\u201d she grumbled.
