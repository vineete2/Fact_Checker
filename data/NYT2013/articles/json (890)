{"headline": "De Blasio Asks City to Address Its Inequalities", "body": "\nIn a mayor\u2019s race crammed with celebrity razzle-dazzle, historic candidacies and tabloid turns, a gangly liberal from Brooklyn is quietly surging into the top tier of the field by talking about decidedly unglamorous topics: neglected hospitals, a swelling poverty rate and a broken prekindergarten system.         \n\nNow that  \n\u2019s campaign has imploded,  \n, the public advocate, is drawing new energy and voter interest to a candidacy that presents the most sweeping rejection of what New York City has become in the past 12 years \u2014 a city, he says, that is defined by its yawning inequities.         \n\n\u201cWe are not, by our nature, an elitist city,\u201d he told a group of young Democrats a few nights ago at a cramped bar in Brooklyn. \u201cWe are not a city for the chosen few.\u201d         \n\nIt is the campaign season\u2019s riskiest calculation: that New Yorkers, who have become comfortably accustomed to the smooth-running, highly efficient apparatus of government under Michael R. Bloomberg, are prepared to embrace a much different agenda for City Hall \u2014 taxing the rich, elevating the poor and rethinking a Manhattan-centric approach to city services.         \n\nIn a city that is endlessly congratulating itself for its modern renaissance \u2014 record-low crime, unmatched crowds of tourists, streets refashioned in European style \u2014 a day on the campaign trail with Mr. de Blasio is a reminder of unaddressed grievances and glaring disparities.         \n\nDescribing what he calls a \u201ctale of two cities,\u201d rife with inequalities in housing, early childhood education and police tactics, he promised those gathered at the Brooklyn bar that this year\u2019s mayoral race was \u201cgoing to be a reset moment. A major reset.\u201d         \n\nBy the time he was finished, well-dressed professionals, gripping glasses of Brooklyn Lager, began to line up to speak with him. Ignoring the next candidate at the microphone, they pledged their liberal loyalties to Mr. de Blasio, who climbed to No. 2 behind Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, in the latest poll by Quinnipiac University of likely Democratic voters.         \n\nA young husband and wife, both employees of the city, told of their shock at being unable to afford a home in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, an evaporating refuge for middle-income buyers. \u201cNow even the gentrifiers are getting priced out by gentrifiers,\u201d said the husband, Ryan Wanttaja.         \n\nMr. de Blasio\u2019s message, despite the excitement it has drawn from liberal luminaries like Alec Baldwin and Howard Dean, has alarmed many business leaders and Bloomberg aides, who see him as lacking a sophisticated understanding of the city\u2019s economic success and displaying a na\u00efvet\u00e9 about how quickly it can unravel.         \n\n\u201cHe has a very 1960s, 1970s vision for the city,\u201d said Howard Wolfson, a deputy mayor in the Bloomberg administration, invoking a time when crime was rampant and the economy stalled. \u201cIf you prefer the version of the city that existed then, he\u2019s your guy.\u201d         \n\nBeyond that, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s electoral path remains uncertain in a race against better-known Democrats. William C. Thompson Jr., a former comptroller, holds a natural appeal to the city\u2019s fast-growing minority electorate, and Ms. Quinn is trying to capitalize on her history-making chance to become the city\u2019s first lesbian mayor. In many ways, Mr. de Blasio, 52, is a man without a built-in voter base.         \n\nFor much of the spring, he languished in the polls, eclipsed by a camera-hogging Mr. Weiner, whose image as a feisty, outer-borough, anti-establishment figure seemed to drown out his message. \u201cAlong came Anthony,\u201d Mr. de Blasio recalls, dryly.         \n\nNow, Mr. Weiner\u2019s scandal has become Mr. de Blasio\u2019s salvation. During an interview, he acknowledged that disillusioned supporters of the former congressman were giving momentum to his candidacy.         \n\nAt the heart of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s appeal, according to interviews with his supporters and political team, is a willingness to deliver an unvarnished and unstinting critique of the Bloomberg era in spite of polls that show a majority of New Yorkers believe the city is heading in the right direction under the mayor\u2019s leadership.
