{"headline": "Disappointing Fall for \u2018Rock Center,\u2019 a News Program With Big Ambitions", "body": "\nIf \u201cRock Center With Brian Williams\u201d has proved anything in the last year and a half, it is this: However hard it is to gather an audience for any kind of show in prime time, for news programming, the task is even harder.         \n\nThe ambitious NBC newsmagazine was scheduled to be shown for the final time on Friday night. Within NBC News, employees expressed a sense of disappointment \u2014 not so much in the quality of the program, but that it was not rated highly enough to remain on the network schedule. To those who invested much in producing the show, its demise raises doubts about whether any new newsmagazine can succeed on network television these days.         \n\nTo that point, Rome Hartman, the founding producer of \u201cRock Center,\u201d said in an interview: \u201cI hope that\u2019s not true. I sure hope that somebody figures it out.\u201d         \n\n\u201cRock Center\u201d was the first new prime-time newsmagazine to be introduced by any network since CBS added \u201c60 Minutes II\u201d in 1998. Mr. Williams, the anchor of \u201cNBC Nightly News,\u201d had been eager to try something in prime time, and when Comcast took control of NBCUniversal in 2011, he got his chance. For Comcast, giving the go-ahead to \u201cRock Center\u201d was, among other things, a way to provide clear support to the network news division it had just acquired.         \n\nThe newsmagazine had its premiere on Halloween. Unlike CBS\u2019s \u201c48 Hours\u201d and NBC\u2019s \u201cDateline,\u201d which are mainly about crimes and court cases, \u201cRock Center\u201d presented a wide array of stories each week and was closer to the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d model than anything else on television. But the comparisons to \u201c60 Minutes\u201d were rarely complimentary; \u201cIt\u2019s a very hard standard to match,\u201d Mr. Hartman said.         \n\nMore important, \u201c60 Minutes\u201d was able to find its footing four decades ago, before the days of cable and Internet competition. It has a protected Sunday night time slot that often gets a big ratings lift from sporting events that are shown beforehand.         \n\n\u201c60 Minutes II,\u201d on the other hand, was canceled in 2005. And \u201cRock Center\u201d was canceled in May, shortly before NBC announced its schedule for the television season that starts in September. With an audience that sometimes slipped below three million people, the network could not justify another season of \u201cRock Center.\u201d         \n\nAt a time when audiences have far more choices than ever before, online as well as on TV, the people involved with \u201cRock Center\u201d may have simply overestimated the public\u2019s appetite for taped news stories in prime time. Said one former NBC executive: \u201cYou can\u2019t launch a serious newsmagazine anymore. Those potential viewers, if they\u2019re around, they\u2019re watching cable news.\u201d         \n\nThere is no shortage of niche news and information programming on cable. CNN, for instance, will show a new documentary series from Morgan Spurlock this Sunday. HBO recently granted a second season to a youthful newsmagazine, \u201cVice,\u201d and OWN has \u201cOur America,\u201d hosted by Lisa Ling. These programs, though, do not have the sweep of a network newsmagazine.         \n\nIf the decision to cancel \u201cRock Center\u201d was not surprising, it was still dismaying to Mr. Williams and to others on the staff, some of whom will lose their jobs after Friday\u2019s final broadcast. (Many others will be absorbed by other NBC News programs.) One staff member said Mr. Williams felt insulted by the network\u2019s decision; another said what pained Mr. Williams most were the layoffs. Staff members were told not to talk to the news media, so those who did speak did so on condition of anonymity.         \n\nAn NBC spokeswoman said on Thursday that Mr. Williams was not available for an interview about the program\u2019s accomplishments. Patricia Fili-Krushel, the chairwoman of the NBCUniversal News Group, declined through a spokeswoman to comment on the end of \u201cRock Center.\u201d         \n\nStaff members expressed pride in the program, asserting that it was a rare outlet for interviews and investigations that lasted longer than a few minutes. (Typically the program had three to five stories an hour. Once in a while the hour was devoted to a single subject, like one show titled \u201cMormon in America.\u201d)        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/22/business/media/demise-of-rock-center-shows-difficulty-of-creating-a-newsmagazine.html", "date": "2013-06-21", "description": "The NBC show was an ambitious effort to mimic the breadth of \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d but it never generated much of an audience. Friday was its last night."}
