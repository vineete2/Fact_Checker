{"headline": "New Rule at N.F.L.\u2019s Camps: No Tackling. It\u2019s Just Practice.", "body": "\nPro football summer training camps were once filled with two practices a day, grueling sessions that featured helmeted players clashing gladiator-style under a merciless sun.         \n\nThat was before the average N.F.L. salary soared to more than $2 million, forcing coaches and owners to weigh the risk and cost of preseason injuries. At the same time, the athletic community has been responding to research outlining the cumulative, debilitating effects of recurrent head trauma, even in practice. What\u2019s left is a training camp landscape that would have been unrecognizable 10 years ago.         \n\nAs 32 N.F.L. teams opened their camps, the new practice model virtually prohibits tackling and tolerates only nominal full-scale contact between the players, often no more than five minutes a week.         \n\nAt N.F.L. training camps across the nation this week, it\u2019s as if a bunch of touch football games have broken out.         \n\nThe trend against tackling and what is known in football parlance as \u201clive contact\u201d began about five years ago, but it has been especially pronounced this summer.         \n\nThis week, after season-ending knee injuries cost the Philadelphia Eagles two of their starters, Coach Chip Kelly, in his first year with the team, banned tackling for the duration of training camp. Coaches for the Carolina Panthers have issued a similar edict and have been reprimanding any player who knocks someone to the ground. Six days into their training camp, the Giants on Thursday were expecting to wear full pads and engage in limited live contact for the first time.         \n\n\u201cThe amount of contact now is pretty minimal,\u201d the Giants co-owner John Mara said Tuesday, standing near his team\u2019s practice. \u201cI would contend it\u2019s just not necessary. So this has been a good thing.\u201d         \n\nBut if the job of defensive football players is to tackle, don\u2019t they need to practice it? And don\u2019t the running backs and receivers need to practice avoiding tacklers? In spring training in baseball, the batters don\u2019t hit off a tee and the pitchers don\u2019t throw only to catchers.         \n\nGiants Coach Tom Coughlin conceded there was a challenge to preparing 300-pound players for a violent game without letting teammates turn their ferocity on one another.         \n\n\u201cIn this day and age, it\u2019s a very fine line and it is not easy,\u201d Coughlin said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get a team ready to play and they\u2019ve got to be physical, but you can\u2019t step over the line. It\u2019s not worth it.\u201d         \n\nPhiladelphia\u2019s Kelly called it \u201ca dance that everybody\u2019s got to dance,\u201d adding that his players would have four preseason games with unrestricted tackling. Some teams also schedule scrimmages with other teams.         \n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll get plenty of hitting in the games,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to get our guys to the games.\u201d         \n\nAt parts of every training camp practice \u2014 sessions now conducted only once a day, as mandated by a new labor agreement \u2014 there is contact between players. Linemen knock shoulders, although not often at full speed. Wide receivers and defensive backs jostle during pass routes, and running backs sprint through narrow gaps between linemen. But almost every time a ball carrier is encountered by a defensive player, that defender will feint a tackle, then merely tap or tag the offensive player.         \n\nInfrequently, there is a shoulder lowered to deliver a glancing blow, but in the new N.F.L., except in sporadic cases, defenders in training camp do not use their arms to wrap up a ball carrier and drag or thrust him to the ground.         \n\n\u201cThere is just too much threat of injury to bring a guy down during practice,\u201d said Chase Blackburn, Carolina\u2019s middle linebacker.         \n\nMuch of this new model reflects the evolution of a pro football training camp that, in many ways, is not what it used to be. Gone are days when practices were full of primal confrontations and when coaches deprived players of water breaks because they believed it toughened them for the harshest conditions of the regular season.
