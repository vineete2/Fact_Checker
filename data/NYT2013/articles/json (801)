{"headline": "\u2018Beyond the Tree Line\u2019", "body": "\nHUNTINGDON, Tenn. \u2014 Miranda learned she was pregnant on her 18th birthday last September. She and her mother soon painted the nursery pink with brown accents, as they had seen in catalogs. Miranda knew it was going to be a girl, and she had a name ready: Akyia Nicole.         \n\nBy March, the room was in perfect order, as if the baby might arrive in the next moment, not the next month. A mobile dangled over the crib, and the changing table was stocked with diapers and wipes. On top was an album of ultrasound pictures.         \n\n\u201cShe\u2019s got my chin,\u201d Miranda said, finding detailed lines in the shadowy shapes.         \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re crazy,\u201d her mother, Theresa, said with a laugh.         \n\nA rocking chair sat in the corner. The closet was filled with frilly clothes and lots of little shoes, as if every day of Akyia\u2019s life would be Sunday.         \n\nThe bedroom next door was Miranda\u2019s room. The door was covered in stickers and drawings with colorful pens, and the walls had posters of Justin Bieber and Lil Wayne. Under a window was a cage with a hamster named Sniffers. At the foot of Miranda\u2019s twin bed was a portable playpen, assembled and ready for use.         \n\n\u201cI know I\u2019ll be a good mom,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s kind of scary. I\u2019ve never raised a baby.\u201d         \n\nThe edge of one bedroom wall held four certificates of which Miranda was especially proud. One was a certificate from Carroll Academy. Another was a high school diploma, granted by the state of Tennessee. The other two were for completing programs at drug and alcohol rehabilitation centers in 2011.         \n\nYears ago, Miranda was found to have depression and bipolar disorder. She became a heavy drinker in her midteens. She was known to explode in anger.         \n\n\u201cShe put me through some stuff,\u201d her mother said. \u201cWhat kind of trouble was she not getting in? Carroll Academy changed her around. That was the best thing that could have ever happened to her.\u201d         \n\nAt Carroll Academy, after her time in rehabilitation, Miranda played center on the basketball team, but she did not score any points. She missed two free throws during a game at Big Sandy High, her previous school.         \n\n\u201cAnd I always make my free throws,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I guess I was so nervous doing it in front of Big Sandy, and I missed them. I was so mad, too.\u201d         \n\nTeammates adored her, because she was earnest and cheerful, never judgmental, with an easily enticed giggle.         \n\n\u201cSome kids that go there, when they get out of there, they still do the same stuff they did before,\u201d Miranda said. Her round belly pointed toward the ceiling as she sat in the rocking chair where she expected to hold her newborn baby in the coming weeks. \u201cSome people learn from it. Some people don\u2019t. But I did. I don\u2019t remember when\u2019s the last time I\u2019ve been in some trouble. It\u2019s been a long dang time.\u201d         \n\nMiranda was one of nine girls on Carroll Academy\u2019s girls\u2019 basketball team in 2011-12, a squad that won none of its 32 games and lost many of them by more than 50 points. That loose band of troubled teens, assigned to the school by the county juvenile court system, extended the program\u2019s losing streak to 184 games. This season, another winless one, pushed it to 213.         \n\nLike all Carroll Academy teams, last year\u2019s Lady Jaguars were temporarily tossed together by circumstance and disbanded at season\u2019s end. The nine girls splintered in different directions.         \n\nSeveral earned their way back to \u201cregular school,\u201d as they called it. A couple stayed at Carroll Academy and played on this past year\u2019s team. One moved to Illinois to live with her father.         \n\nThree of the girls, however, graduated last year. Miranda, Destiny and Summer were freed from the binds of school, unshackled from the juvenile court system, and set adrift in the broader world of West Tennessee.         \n\nThey shared one unpredicted sentiment: each wished, in a way, that she could go back to Carroll Academy. They found that life was harder outside the school than inside it.         \n\nNone of the girls had jobs. None went to college or trade school. None had a place of her own. All spent their days in relative isolation, finding structure and routine mostly in the daytime television schedule. Destiny and Summer regularly smoked marijuana and drank alcohol. Miranda was about to join Summer as an unwed teenage mother.         \n\nThey were caught between two worlds \u2014 the one of rules and order that they left behind, and the one filled with responsibilities they did not imagine and hopes they could not reach.         \n\n\u201cOur job here is to keep them out of custody and give them the education,\u201d said the Carroll Academy director Randy Hatch, who grew up in Huntingdon. \u201cThen we turn them loose into the world. No different than Huntingdon High School, where the locals go. We\u2019re putting them out into the world. What\u2019s for them to do? What is out there?\u201d         \n\nAll three girls applied multiple times to the various fast-food restaurants in their towns. Each pondered more education at one of the region\u2019s technical schools. But the lack of jobs, and the cost of cars and gas to navigate the stretched-out landscape, made even the first steps into the real world daunting, if not unmanageable.         \n\nSo they waited, frozen in time and place.         \n\n\u201cFor someone who\u2019s 18, you\u2019ve got one of two choices, that I see,\u201d Hatch said. \u201cYou\u2019re either going to go to college, if you can get in, or you\u2019re going to join the military. If you can find a job, it\u2019s going to be by the hour. You\u2019re not going to find something that\u2019s going to help you raise a family. Those jobs are just not here.\u201d         \n\nDestiny had no car and earned money baby-sitting for a friend. Summer had a 2-year-old and a broken-down car in the front yard. Miranda dreamed of cosmetology school before she became pregnant. In March, she said her next goal was to move to Paris \u2014 Paris, Tenn., a nearby town of 10,000.         \n\nNone of the girls wanted to leave. Ambitions rarely extend past the horizon.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said, \u2018Look, go out and do a 360, and stand around and just look as far as you can see,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Hatch said. \u201cAll you see is trees. I call it the tree line. And I\u2019m telling you, I\u2019m promising you, beyond that tree line, there is a world of opportunity. Not to say there isn\u2019t here. But there\u2019s a world of opportunity. And you\u2019re going to have to reach out and find it. The problem is, how do they get out beyond the tree line, whether it\u2019s through education or finding a job or something? It\u2019s really difficult.\u201d         \n\nFor most of her pregnancy, Miranda did not want to discuss the baby\u2019s father. It was a friend, she said, someone she had hoped to start dating regularly before she became pregnant. But then the two split, and Miranda learned she was pregnant, and she had not talked to him since she told him that the baby was his. She hoped he would come around.         \n\n\u201cI want her to have a father in her life,\u201d she said in March. \u201cAnd the child support.\u201d         \n\nMiranda\u2019s reluctance in discussing the baby\u2019s father stemmed from the fact that he was black. The 2010 census counted 557 residents of Big Sandy. None were listed as black.         \n\n\u201cBlack people would be scared to come here,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cThe only time they would come would be at night, and then they\u2019d still be scared.\u201d         \n\nWhy at night?         \n\n\u201cBecause no one would see them,\u201d she explained.         \n\nTheresa, 44, grew up in the area. She said its reputation for being unfriendly to blacks was once deserved, and has been hard to shake. The winding roads to Big Sandy are lined with several homes flying Confederate flags.         \n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s changed a lot since I was little,\u201d Theresa said.         \n\nMiranda waited many months before she told her mother about the baby\u2019s father.         \n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really say nothing,\u201d Theresa said. \u201cI just don\u2019t believe in blacks and whites together. I ain\u2019t got nothing against black people. It\u2019s just that I don\u2019t believe in it. I don\u2019t know. Maybe it\u2019s just how I was raised or whatever. But I don\u2019t have a problem with them whatsoever.\u201d         \n\nMiranda planned to stay in her mother\u2019s house for at least a few months after the baby was born, but wanted to move to Paris, where blacks make up about 20 percent of the population and mixed-race babies are increasingly common. Theresa agreed that it might be best to have Akyia grow up outside Big Sandy.         \n\nOn April 12, at a hospital about 90 minutes away in Jackson, Akyia Nicole was born. She was 8 pounds 5 ounces and deemed perfectly healthy.         \n\nMiranda did not try to reach Akyia\u2019s father.         \n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know she was born yet,\u201d she said, more than a month after the birth. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t feel like telling him. If she wants to know her father, I\u2019ll tell her. But until then, no. I don\u2019t want her father in and out of her life. I\u2019ve had two fathers\u201d \u2014 a biological one and a stepfather \u2014 \u201cand neither of them are in my life. Maybe that\u2019s where that comes from.\u201d         \n\nInto the summer, three generations lived together in the woods outside Big Sandy. Miranda, owner of a drivers\u2019 license after about a dozen failed attempts on the written test, proudly drove Akyia to see friends from Carroll Academy, like her old basketball coach, Tonya Lutz. She posted photos of Akyia on Facebook almost every day.         \n\nThe freshly painted and well-equipped nursery went virtually unused. Akyia slept every night with Miranda, in the bedroom with its walls covered in posters of Justin Bieber and certificates from Carroll Academy, and where a small cage under the window was home to a hamster named Sniffers.         \n\nFor the fourth day in a row, Destiny sat on the living room couch, watching a DVD of the movie \u201cWelcome Home Roscoe Jenkins.\u201d She lived rent-free in a brick duplex in the town of Milan, spelled like the northern Italian fashion capital but pronounced MY-lin in West Tennessee. It is not far from Dresden and Paris, other small towns named for grander places.         \n\nDestiny, 18, knew a 22-year-old woman named Melissa, who saw in Destiny a little bit of herself \u2014 a troubled background, a life on the verge, a need for help. Destiny had a high school diploma from Carroll Academy, the same school Melissa attended for several years. But Destiny had no job, no car, no money and no place to live.         \n\nMelissa, with a new job as a home-care provider \u2014 helping patients get fed, use the bathroom and keep their homes clean \u2014 asked Destiny to come live with her this spring. Melissa had two daughters, ages 3 and 6, and wanted Destiny to walk them to school and to day care, and be there to greet them at the end of the day.         \n\nMelissa paid Destiny $40 a week and bought most of her food. She did not charge rent.         \n\n\u201cD. J.\u2019s been running from place to place, not having any place to go,\u201d Melissa said, using Destiny\u2019s nickname. \u201cWhen the job called me, I knew I had to have somebody help me. It\u2019s me versus the world. I\u2019ve got to make a way for me and my kids. Period. But I knew D. J. was in need, too. She needed a place to stay and a place to call home. She wouldn\u2019t have to worry about where she was going to sleep at night.\u201d         \n\nA year earlier,  \n, the leading scorer in all but two games. She was a tough, sometimes pugnacious point guard, equally adept at putting her head down and driving toward the basket or lofting rainbow 3-pointers. In the final game, she scored 28 points in a 52-32 loss, one of the closer contests of the season.         \n\nBut she had tenuous, strained relationships with her parents, and often killed time on street corners and in the living rooms of acquaintances, stumbling into her next high. She slept wherever she was invited.         \n\nPart of the group that Destiny hung around with included a half-sister of Melissa\u2019s. They grew close, and Destiny got a tattoo of the girl\u2019s first initial on her left arm. (On her right arm, she had an incomplete cross that she created with a do-it-yourself tattoo kit.) But they went their separate ways this spring, and Melissa reached out to Destiny.         \n\n\u201cAs long as she stays around people who are going to motivate her, people who are going places and want to do things, she\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Melissa said.         \n\nDestiny said she often woke up, got the children to school and day care, and returned to bed. She spent hours each day watching television. She began playing basketball for the first time since she left Carroll Academy with boys at a nearby playground.         \n\nMilan is about 20 miles from Huntingdon, and other towns where Destiny knew people. Distractions were few, and with no car, usually out of reach.         \n\n\u201cI wanted to get out of Carroll County,\u201d Destiny said. \u201cThere was too much drama. Here, I don\u2019t hardly know nobody, so I can\u2019t just walk out and see people, like, \u2018Hey what\u2019s up?\u2019 It\u2019s very good for me. I like it.\u201d         \n\nBut weekends brought parties, and Destiny found her way to more than a few. Even in the quiet hours at home, she found herself regularly smoking marijuana.         \n\n\u201cIf I really wanted to stop, I don\u2019t have to have it,\u201d Destiny said. \u201cBut it removes a lot of stress.\u201d         \n\nDestiny visited Carroll Academy for the first time in nearly a year. She wore jeans and a short-sleeved yellow knit shirt. Hatch, the school director, tossed her a Carroll Academy Lady Jaguars sweatshirt as she folded herself into a large, padded chair.         \n\n\u201cI miss Carroll Academy,\u201d she said. \u201cI miss it so much. I love it here. I didn\u2019t at first, but now I think: Dang, they told me those things for a reason. It\u2019s weird. I hated this place with a passion. I did. I tried to do everything I could to get out.\u201d         \n\nIt was across the hall, in the bathroom, where Destiny had taken a urine test for drugs a year before. It immediately came up as positive. She worried that her chance at getting a high school diploma was gone, and that a stint in jail was possible.         \n\nBut now she wore a smile, one that reflected the comfort she had in these hallways, a shelter from the world outside.         \n\n\u201cEverything hits you, all at once,\u201d she said. \u201cSmacks you. Like, hey, world. I like being out of school, but I like being in school, too. If you don\u2019t have a job, there\u2019s nothing to do. I\u2019d rather be sitting here with a pencil in my hand than sitting at home watching TV.\u201d         \n\nA few nights later, she came to a basketball game with Summer and Constance, two other former Lady Jaguars. She wore a flat-brimmed cap and mostly sneered, interrupting her swagger with occasional bursts of maniacal laughter. From across the floor, the girls on the current Lady Jaguars thought Destiny was trying to show off and rolled their eyes. Those who knew Destiny presumed that she was high on something. Something was not right.         \n\nBefore the end of the game, Destiny was in a sudden and desperate search for a ride. She had no car, and worried about how she would get to Milan or where she would sleep that night. She left abruptly.         \n\nWord of her behavior spread through Carroll Academy the next day. Tonya Lutz, her former coach, called Destiny the next day to see that she was O.K.         \n\nWeeks later, at the home she shared with Melissa, Destiny was introspective and polite. It was early afternoon, and she had cleaned the house and was watching television. Melissa arrived, between home visits for work, wearing green medical scrubs.         \n\nDestiny said that she had applied at all the fast-food places in town, some of them several times. But those jobs were hard to get. She looked online at options for school, maybe down in Jackson or over at the technical-trade school in McKenzie, but she did not know what she wanted to do. Besides, she had no car.         \n\n\u201cHer biggest thing is that she needs transportation,\u201d Melissa said.         \n\nMelissa drove a 2001 Buick Century with a broken odometer.         \n\n\u201cI might get a car and give her mine,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like she would take care of it. I\u2019m not going to sign her name to it right away \u2014 not going to lie \u2014 but if I\u2019ve seen that she\u2019s got a job or that she\u2019s going to school, I\u2019d sign it over to her. She\u2019s just got to show me she\u2019s doing something with it.\u201d         \n\nThe two of them stepped onto the front porch to smoke cigarettes. The house sat on an U-shaped street lined with small brick duplexes, public housing for the poor.         \n\nMelissa had landed there, a former Carroll Academy student and admitted former drug addict, now a single mother toting two girls from two fathers, with a job she barely tolerated and a 12-year-old car out front.         \n\nShe was Destiny\u2019s steadying influence.         \n\n\u201cA year from now? She\u2019ll have a part-time job,\u201d Melissa said of Destiny. \u201cMaybe school. She\u2019ll be doing something. She doesn\u2019t like to be doing nothing. She\u2019s not hard to motivate.\u201d         \n\nMelissa thought for a moment.         \n\n\u201cReally,\u201d she said, \u201cno one\u2019s hard to motivate if they see they\u2019re getting something out of it.\u201d         \n\nA year ago, after the Lady Jaguars finished their season and before Summer was scheduled to graduate, Summer stopped going to school.         \n\nShe was a single mother, her son nearly a year old, and she was doing drugs again. Her juvenile probation officer saw Summer walking through a neighborhood in McKenzie. Carroll Academy officials called her, urging her to return. She was only weeks from getting her diploma.         \n\nA school employee picked up Summer and brought her in. She sat in the office of Hatch, the school\u2019s director.         \n\n\u201cMr. Randy said if I didn\u2019t come back to school, he\u2019d have a warrant out for my arrest in every county I could go to,\u201d Summer recalled this spring. \u201cAnd I\u2019d do my homework behind bars. I didn\u2019t have a choice.\u201d         \n\nHatch smiled at the memory.         \n\n\u201cI bluffed her,\u201d he said. Carroll Academy and the juvenile court system had no jurisdiction over her, since she had turned 18. \u201cBut I said, \u2018If you miss another day, you\u2019re going to jail, and we\u2019ll bring your books to the jail.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nSummer finished school. She received her high school diploma. By the end of the school year, she was helping tutor other students.         \n\nIt was late March this spring, just after her 19th birthday, and Summer sat on the couch of the house that her father shared with his girlfriend. Summer watched television, and her 21-month-old son, DaMarion, played on the shag rug at her feet. She wore jeans and a tight T-shirt, exposing a tattoo of her son\u2019s name below her left collarbone. On her abdomen was a tattoo of the name of an aunt who was murdered several years ago in Nashville. On the inside of her left wrist was a tattoo of red brass knuckles. Summer\u2019s hair was streaked reddish-blond, not the light brown that it was the year before.         \n\nThe year had not been kind to Summer. The damage, she admitted, was largely self-inflicted.         \n\n\u201cA year ago, I probably would have said I\u2019d have a job, have my own place,\u201d Summer said in her singsong lilt. \u201cBut it\u2019s been rough. I\u2019m still learning. Everything didn\u2019t go as planned. It\u2019s been hell. I\u2019ve been through lots of stuff.\u201d         \n\nShe bounced from home to home, a string of trailers and old motels with a shifting cast of friends and roommates. She became pregnant again but awoke one morning to stomach pain and soon learned from the doctor that she lost the baby. She got into two fights with other girls, behavior that helped land her at Carroll Academy for her senior year of high school.         \n\nLast summer, she said, she smoked marijuana and took several Adderall pills that she said a friend\u2019s mother gave them.         \n\n\u201cI was up more than 24 hours,\u201d Summer said. \u201cAll of a sudden, I was sitting there, writing a letter, and I started feeling sick. My head hurt and my vision was wigging out. Everything was shifting, all crazy. I was laying there, and it felt like my heart was going to come out of my chest. I was crying and praying. Freaking out. I finally fell asleep. Someone called it speedballing. After that, I kind of slowed down.\u201d         \n\nSummer said that she still smoked marijuana most days. She drank often, too \u2014 cheap vodka, mostly. When someone else watched DaMarion, often her mother, living with her own mother about 20 miles away, Summer and her friends sometimes bought pineapple soda, or other flavored soft drinks. They dumped out half of the soda and filled the void with vodka.         \n\n\u201cNow we\u2019re buying lemonade-flavored vodka,\u201d she said.         \n\nFor part of the year, Summer received $142 a month, and a $15 gas card, she said, from Tennessee\u2019s Families First program. It required that she spend a set number of hours looking for a job. She applied mostly at fast-food places and at Walmart. She even talked to a Marine recruiter, Summer said, but she does not want to leave DaMarion behind for military service.         \n\nFor those unable to find work, the welfare program required community service. Summer worked at a Salvation Army retail store until she argued with a supervisor and walked out. The welfare checks soon stopped.         \n\nSummer\u2019s father and his girlfriend, a woman in her 20s with two children, were engaged on Valentine\u2019s Day. By then, Summer had returned to live with them, in a well-kept ranch-style house on the bend of a country road, a couple of miles off the highway that connects McKenzie and Gleason.         \n\nFor Summer, it was a blessing and a curse \u2014 away from the troublesome distractions that always seemed to pull her in, but uncomfortably distant to friends and the world she knew.         \n\nShe had no transportation. An old Nissan Maxima could be hers, but it sat broken down in the driveway, its problems too expensive to repair. Her connections were largely through Facebook, her postings mostly stream-of-consciousness doodles of scattered emotions.         \n\nDaMarion\u2019s father, a former Carroll Academy student, spent part of the past year in jail after being caught by the police with a large stash of marijuana. Summer said she had not seen him for months, until he was out on a work-release program, and they bumped into each other at a party.         \n\nHe worked at McDonald\u2019s and spent weekends back in jail, Summer said, which is why he missed her birthday party, where her father barbecued and there was a bonfire in the backyard and people crowded around the television to watch an ultimate fighting bout. But he paid her $300 a month in child support, she said, and with the blessing of Summer\u2019s father, eventually moved in to the house.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re saving money to get a place together,\u201d Summer said in March. \u201cI\u2019m doing better. Now that I\u2019m back with him, I\u2019ve got my priorities right. My family \u2014 my little family. I\u2019m trying to get a job and get out of here.\u201d         \n\nA few weeks later, DaMarion\u2019s father had moved out.         \n\nSummer was a leader of the 2011-12 Lady Jags,  \n. During one game, she collided with an opponent and split the corner above her right eye. She wobbled to the bench and passed out. An ambulance carried her to the hospital, where she had several stitches that left a scar. Summer liked it, but it had faded over the past year.         \n\nShe had been a good athlete as a girl, spending years on travel softball teams. It was when she quit those teams in her midteens, her father said, that she stumbled into trouble, filling the vacant hours with drugs and delinquency.         \n\nThat divide is reflected in a day-to-day life of contradictions. Summer can seem two different people. She picked fights on Facebook and spoke the foul language of ghetto bravado. She finished notes with smiley faces and had insightful conversations with perfect grammar.         \n\n\u201cSpongeBob SquarePants\u201d blared on the television. DaMarion walked around, chewing on snacks and clinging to his mother.
