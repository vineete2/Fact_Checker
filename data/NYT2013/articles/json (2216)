They added up dots on pairs of dice before sprinting to round mats imprinted with mathematical symbols. And while in push-up position, they balanced on one arm and used the other (\u201cAlternate!\u201d Ms. Patelsky urged. \u201cThat\u2019s one of your vocabulary words\u201d) to stack oversize Lego blocks in columns labeled \u201cones,\u201d \u201ctens\u201d and \u201chundreds.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t work for Parks and Recreation,\u201d said Ms. Patelsky, explaining the unorthodox approach to what has traditionally been one of the few breaks from the academic routine during the school day. \u201cI am a teacher first.\u201d         \n\nSpurred by an intensifying focus on student test scores in math and English as well as a desire to incorporate more health and fitness information, more school districts are pushing physical education teachers to move beyond soccer, kickball and tennis to include reading, writing and arithmetic as well. New standards for English and math that have been adopted by 45 states and the District of Columbia recommend that teachers in a wide variety of subjects incorporate literacy instruction and bring more \u201cinformational text\u201d into the curriculum. Many states have interpreted these standards to include physical education and have developed recommendations and curriculum for districts and teachers to incorporate literacy skills and informational text into gym classes.         \n\nBut some parents say they object to the way testing is creeping into every corner of school life. And some educators worry that pushing academics into P.E. class could defeat its primary purpose.         \n\nWhile generations of bookish but clumsy children who feared being the last pick for the dodge ball team may welcome the injection of math and reading into gym class, the push is also motivated by a simple fight for survival by physical education departments.         \n\nAs budget cuts force school officials to make choices between subjects, \u201cit\u2019s just a way to make P.E. teachers more of an asset to schools and seem as important\u201d as teachers in core subjects like language arts, math and science, said Eric Stern, the administrator in charge of physical education for the Palm Beach County schools, the country\u2019s 11th-largest school district. \u201cWe are taking away the typical stereotype of what P.E. used to be like.\u201d         \n\nAcross the country, P.E. teachers now post vocabulary lists on gym walls, ask students to test Newton\u2019s Laws of Motion as they toss balls, and give quizzes on parts of the skeleton or food groups.         \n\nAt Deep Creek Elementary School in Chesapeake, Va., children count in different languages during warm-up exercises and hop on letter mats to spell out words during gym class.         \n\nChellie LaFayette, the physical education teacher at Roxhill Elementary in Seattle, used an iPad purchased with a federal grant to show her students pictures of the Iditarod sled dog race and maps of mountain ranges for which she had named routes on a climbing wall.         \n\nIn some cases, homework and testing have accompanied the new gym content. Last year, the District of Columbia added 50 questions about health and physical education to its end-of-year standardized tests.         \n\nNot all parents are pleased with the changes. \u201cI think there is such a thing as taking something too far,\u201d said Kathleen Oropeza, co-founder of Fund Education Now, a nonprofit public education advocacy group in Florida. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got children who are learning the joy of being a good goalie or learning that they want to participate as part of the team, why does that have to be overshadowed by the hard, high-stakes test environment?\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/19/education/gym-class-isnt-just-fun-and-games-anymore.html", "date": "2013-02-18", "description": "It is no longer enough in some schools for students to run around during gym.
