{"headline": "Senate, 68 to 32, Passes Overhaul for Immigration", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate on Thursday approved the most significant overhaul of the nation\u2019s immigration laws in a generation with broad support generated by a sense among leading Republicans that the party needed to join with Democrats to remove a wedge between Republicans and Hispanic voters.         \n\nThe strong 68-to-32 vote in the often polarized Senate tossed the issue into the House, where the Republican leadership has said that it will not take up the Senate measure and is instead focused on much narrower legislation that would not provide a path to citizenship for the 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the country. Party leaders hope that the Senate action will put pressure on the House.         \n\nLeading up to the final votes, which the senators cast at their desks to mark the import of the moment, members of the bipartisan \u201cGang of Eight,\u201d who drafted the framework of the legislation, took to the Senate floor to make a final argument for the measure. Among them was Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, who is one of his party\u2019s leading Hispanic voices. When Mr. Rubio finished, the other senators in the group surrounded him on the floor, patting him on the back and offering words of encouragement. \u201cGood job,\u201d one said. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you,\u201d another offered.         \n\nThe future will show whether voters in Republican presidential primaries share that pride.         \n\nAfter Mitt Romney\u2019s loss in November, top Republicans immediately began formulating a way to improve the party\u2019s standing with Hispanics, who have flocked to Democrats. A group of top Republican political and business officials who support an immigration overhaul met at the downtown Washington office of the anti-tax leader Grover Norquist on Jan. 17 with memories of Mr. Romney\u2019s poor showing in their minds.         \n\nOptimism ran high at the session, which included Mr. Norquist, the former national party chairman Ed Gillespie and representatives of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Republican \u201csuper PACs.\u201d Reeling from a second consecutive presidential loss and with Mr. Rubio taking the place of Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, as the face of the immigration reform movement, the strategists were hopeful that the wall of conservative opposition that blocked immigration legislation under President George W. Bush could be breached.         \n\nNow, even after the lopsided Senate vote, the prospects appear grim for the pro-overhaul Republicans. And Mr. Rubio, the 42-year-old Cuban-American who is seen as a prime White House contender in 2016, is confronting rising criticism from conservatives for pushing legislation with Democratic boogeymen like President Obama and Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York.         \n\n\u201cBefore the Gang of Eight and the immigration debate, I think many conservatives as well as some establishment Republican folks saw Senator Rubio as a possible bridge candidate between the conservative Tea Party base of the G.O.P. and more establishment G.O.P. voters,\u201d said Greg Mueller, a conservative public relations executive who opposed the Senate bill. \u201cThat position is on much shakier ground today because conservatives and the Tea Party see the immigration bill as a big-government piece of legislation resembling Obamacare.\u201d         \n\nRepublicans strongly opposed to the immigration bill said they had little sympathy for Mr. Rubio.         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re doing any damage to him,\u201d said Representative Tim Huelskamp, Republican of Kansas. \u201cI think he\u2019s done damage to himself with the amnesty bill.\u201d         \n\nAlex Conant, Mr. Rubio\u2019s spokesman, said: \u201cImmigration is a personal issue for Senator Rubio, and he took it on because he thought it was the right thing to do.\u00a0There may be some political implications, especially in the short term, but it wasn\u2019t an issue he believed he could ignore. We don\u2019t expect any parades for our work on this.\u201d         \n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Rubio had little cover from his party\u2019s right flank, much less a parade.\u00a0 Not wanting to tempt primary opponents next year, the top two Senate Republican leaders \u2014 Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and John Cornyn of Texas \u2014 cast \u201cno\u201d votes.\u00a0 And a potential 2016 presidential primary rival for Mr. Rubio, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, also voted against the legislation, despite making a show of announcing his general support for an immigration overhaul earlier in the year.
