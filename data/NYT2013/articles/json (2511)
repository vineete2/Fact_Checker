{"headline": "Li Na, China\u2019s Tennis Rebel", "body": "\nThe patch of Wimbledon grass known as the Graveyard of Champions was supposedly exorcised four years ago, when the blue-blazered gentlemen of the All England Lawn Tennis Club demolished Court 2, built a new grandstand in its place and, in 2011, renamed the haunted space Court 3. But the tennis fans watching the 2013 championships still knew. Li Na, China\u2019s tennis rebel, knew, too. This was the same cursed court where top seeds like Pete Sampras and Serena Williams had suffered ignominious defeats, falling to unheralded players in the early rounds. Now Li, the former French Open champion and sixth-ranked player in the world, teetered one game away from a third-round loss to the Czech veteran Klara Zakopalova. \u201cAt that moment,\u201d she told me later, \u201cI suddenly saw myself with my bags going to the airport. It made my heart ache.\u201d         \n\nFor two hours, Li had struggled against her hard-hitting opponent. Trailing 5-6 in the third set, she walked to the baseline knowing that she had to break serve just to stay alive. Lose the next four points, and she might carry out her pretournament threat to quit the sport she had been forced to start playing nearly a quarter-century ago. Her spring season had been a bruising free fall from the heights of her second Australian Open final in January to her second-round flameout at the French Open in May. Now the graveyard was calling.         \n\nAs Li crouched at the baseline, the cluster of Chinese fans waving little red flags went still. On the first serve, Li blasted a winner down the line. Five points later, she pounced on her first break-point opportunity, scorching a forehand winner \u2014 and letting out a scream \u2014 to even the set at 6-all. Two more games, another roar: Li had survived. It was just a third-round match, and she had played erratically. But after her recent run of defeats \u2014 marked by what appeared to be a lack of conviction at decisive moments \u2014 pulling out this victory felt redemptive. \u201cI fought like mad,\u201d she said with a grin. \u201cWinning this match felt as good as getting to a Grand Slam final.\u201d         \n\nOne more obstacle awaited Li that afternoon. Walking into the press room in her sleek white sweatsuit, she looked warily at the assembled Chinese reporters. Her smile was pinched. China\u2019s state-run media, which happily extols her victories for bringing glory to the motherland, had recently intensified its attacks on her streak of individualism, which has grown only stronger since she left the Chinese sports system in 2008. The furor began after her collapse at the French Open a month earlier, when a reporter for the government\u2019s Xinhua news agency asked her to explain her disappointing result to her nation\u2019s fans. \u201cI lost a match and that\u2019s it,\u201d Li snapped. \u201cDo I need to get on my knees and kowtow to them?\u201d Her comment ignited a round of official criticism, rebuking her lack of patriotism and manners. Now, the very same reporter raised his hand to ask Li, once again, to address her fans. She glared at him for almost a full minute before mumbling, \u201cI say, \u2018Thank you, fans.\u2019 \u201d         \n\n \n prefer that we forget about China and judge her by her character and accomplishments alone. Hers, after all, is the tale of a conflicted working-class girl \u2014 the daughter of an athlete whose own dreams were thwarted by political strife \u2014 who rose to become one of the finest, richest and most influential players of her generation. All in a sport that most of her compatriots had never watched before.         \n\nA mercurial star who blends speed and power \u2014 and occasional meltdowns \u2014 Li became Asia\u2019s first and only Grand Slam singles champion when she won the French Open in 2011. She is also the first Chinese-born player to crack the world\u2019s Top Five \u2014 an elite group she rejoined last month after her run at Wimbledon. With nearly $40 million in sponsorship deals signed in the past three years, she is now the third-highest-compensated female athlete in  \n sport, trailing only Maria Sharapova and Serena Williams.         \nLi Na begins a day of training with Romain Deffet in Beijing\u2019s southern outskirts. She trains six days a week, from morning to late afternoon, alternating fitness sessions and tennis. \n\nStill, it is impossible to separate Li from China. She is one of the country\u2019s biggest celebrities, with more than 21 million followers on the Twitter-like Weibo (by comparison, LeBron James has 9.4 million Twitter followers). A record 116 million Chinese viewers watched her triumph in the French Open, a bigger audience than the Super Bowl attracted that year. The tens of millions of dollars in endorsements that Li has collected depend on her connection to the Chinese market. Had she been born in Chile, Chad or even Chicago, she would not be one of the top three earners. Nor would the Women\u2019s Tennis Association be unveiling a new pro tournament next year in her home city of Wuhan, in central China. Five years ago, the W.T.A. staged two tournaments in the country; in 2014, there will be eight. The W.T.A.'s chief executive, Stacey Allaster, credits Li with helping spark a tennis explosion in Asia. \u201cIf the Williams sisters had the greatest impact on the first decade of this century,\u201d Allaster says, \u201cthen I would say, without a doubt, that Li Na will be the most important player of this decade.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/25/magazine/li-na-chinas-tennis-rebel.html", "date": "2013-08-22", "description": "What she wants and what the Chinese government wants are not the same.
