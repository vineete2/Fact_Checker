{"headline": "A Potato\u2019s Postcard From Spain", "body": "\nBefore I had ever tasted a tortilla Espa\u00f1ola, the traditional Spanish potato omelet, I couldn\u2019t imagine what the fuss was about. What could be so special about a dish made from only eggs, potatoes and onion?         \n\nThen I bit into a thick slab of it at a tapas bar and it all made sense. It wasn\u2019t just the eggs, potatoes and onion that gave the tortilla its character. It was the olive oil. Every bite was suffused with the good stuff. The fragrant oil flavored the potatoes and turned the onions soft and sweet.         \n\nAnd then there was the appealing, firm texture. Unlike a French omelet, which is loose and wobbly, or an Italian frittata, which is puffy and custardy, a tortilla is a solid cake with just enough egg to bind the vegetables. I could easily pick it up with my fingers before it disappeared down my throat.         \n\nA Spanish tortilla is not hard to make at home and you probably have all the ingredients on hand. And you can serve it for dinner, lunch or brunch, either warm or at room temperature. The bottom line: It\u2019s a good recipe to add to your repertory.         \n\nThe first step is to make what is basically a potato and onion confit by gently cooking the sliced vegetables in plenty of olive oil. And plenty means at least a cup, or maybe two. It sounds like a lot, but most of it stays in the pan (and you can reuse it). Other than adding great flavor, the oil turns the potatoes velvety and luscious. Just make sure the heat is low enough so that the potatoes and onions cook but don\u2019t brown very much, though a few darkened spots are fine.         \n\nMy version stays pretty traditional, except for one small change. Instead of turning the tortilla out onto a plate to flip it over in the pan and brown the top, I stick the whole pan in the oven. It\u2019s easier, and makes me less nervous about breaking it.         \n\nA potato tortilla is marvelous on its own without any embellishments. But it also goes nicely with a brightly flavored condiment or sauce. A Spanish friend once served me a tortilla with a pungent garlic mayonnaise. I\u2019ve also had it served with a thick, peppery tomato sauce. In this version, I\u2019ve paired it with a simple salsalike tomato and pepper salad that complements the soft, rich potatoes. One bite and you\u2019ll understand the fuss.
