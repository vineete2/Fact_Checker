{"headline": "Stories Add Up as Bully Image Trails Christie", "body": "\nIn 2010, John F. McKeon, a New Jersey assemblyman, made what he thought was a mild comment on a radio program: Some of the public employees that Gov. Chris Christie was then vilifying had been some of the governor\u2019s biggest supporters.         \n\nHe was surprised to receive a handwritten note from Mr. Christie, telling him that he had heard the comments, and that he didn\u2019t like them.         \n\n\u201cI thought it was a joke,\u201d Mr. McKeon recalled. \u201cWhat governor would take the time to write a personal note over a relatively innocuous comment?\u201d         \n\nBut the gesture would come to seem genteel compared with the fate suffered by others in disagreements with Mr. Christie: a former governor who was stripped of police security at public events; a Rutgers professor who lost state financing for cherished programs; a state senator whose candidate for a judgeship suddenly stalled; another senator who was disinvited from an event with the governor in his own district.         \n\nIn almost every case, Mr. Christie waved off any suggestion that he had meted out retribution. But to many, the incidents have left that impression, and it has been just as powerful in scaring off others who might dare to cross him.         \n\nNow, the governor is dogged by another accusation of petty political revenge. Two close political allies ordered the  \n of two local access lanes on the George Washington Bridge in September, gridlocking Fort Lee, N.J., for four days. The borough\u2019s mayor said it was punitive because he had declined to endorse the governor\u2019s re-election.         \n\nThe governor mocked the suggestion as preposterous. But Democrats in New Jersey \u2014 and privately, some Republicans too \u2014 say it would hardly be out of character for Mr. Christie. As the governor prepares to run for president, the accusation has reinforced his reputation as a bully.         \n\n\u201cEvery organization takes its cues from the leadership as to what\u2019s acceptable and what\u2019s not, and this governor, in his public appearances, has made thuggery acceptable,\u201d said Assemblyman John S. Wisniewski, the Democrat leading the hearings that have exposed the role of the governor\u2019s aides in the lane closings. \u201cFor the governor to say, \u2018I knew nothing about this\u2019? He created the atmosphere in which this is acceptable.\u201d         \n\nIt was the governor\u2019s penchant for confrontation that first propelled him onto the national stage in 2010. As he pushed to cut public employee benefits, his staff celebrated video clips of him dressing down teachers at town hall-style meetings by posting them on YouTube. (\u201cYou want to come up here? Come up here,\u201d the governor said to one teacher, a fellow Republican, who hesitated until the governor\u2019s security state troopers gave him no choice. Wagging a finger, Mr. Christie lectured the man, then dismissed him from the hall.)         \n\nBut his confrontations are not always that public.         \n\nIn 2011, Mr. Christie held a news conference where he accused State Senator Richard J. Codey of being \u201ccombative and difficult\u201d in blocking two nominees. Mr. Codey, a Democrat who had served as governor following the resignation of James E. McGreevey, responded that he had not only signed off on the nominations, but had held a meeting to try to hurry them along.         \n\nThree days later, Mr. Codey was walking out of an event in Newark when he got a call from the state police superintendent informing him that he would no longer be afforded the trooper who accompanied him to occasional public events \u2014 a courtesy granted all former governors. That same day, his cousin, who had been appointed by Mr. McGreevey to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, was fired, as was a close friend and former deputy chief of staff who was then working in the state Office of Consumer Affairs.         \n\n\u201cI understand politics, that a new administration comes in,\u201d Mr. Codey said, but he believed this was not about Mr. Christie bringing in his own people. \u201cThis was all about sending a message.\u201d         \n\nThe governor laughed at the allegation of retribution, and his spokesman belittled the Democratic Party chairman who complained about it.
