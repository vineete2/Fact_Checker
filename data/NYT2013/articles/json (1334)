{"headline": "Smells Like Green Spirit", "body": "\nCanlis floats high above Lake Union in Seattle, a Northwest Modernist gem of timber and glass and stone, Seattle\u2019s fanciest, finest restaurant for more than 60 years. Named for its founder, Peter Canlis, it is now run by two of his grandsons, Brian and Mark, elegant young Canlises in slim dark suits with pocket squares and good haircuts.         \n\nThe atmosphere at Canlis is first-tier cosmopolitan: moneyed, confident, well dressed. The dining room\u2019s broad, angled windows take in tiny diamonds of house light and zooming traffic shining from Eastlake and Capitol Hill, reflecting off the water, getting swallowed by canopies of red oak and bigleaf maple and the inky blackness of the sky. \u201cFreakishly scenic,\u201d is how the novelist Jim Lynch described the city in \u201cTruth Like the Sun,\u201d his excellent novel about 40 years of power and newspapering there. From a comfortable perch at Canlis, you might call it an understatement.         \n\nCanlis was and remains modern in its approach to cooking and wine, even as it continues to embrace the notion that the most important aspect of any restaurant meal is the guest\u2019s experience. (A small example: No claim checks are given for coats, bags or cars. You simply hand them over and get them back, and your car is idling out front as you push open the door to leave.)         \n\nThe food is no afterthought, however. There was Boeing money around early on and plenty of fresh fish and recipe ideas coming in on the Pan Am flights from Hawaii. Mahi-mahi and beef teriyaki, in Seattle circa 1950, made Peter Canlis something of a maverick, even as he served them alongside steaks and salmon.         \n\nHis grandsons continue this tradition, now with the chef Jason Franey in the kitchen, offering their grandfather\u2019s twice-baked potatoes alongside an aged Muscovy duck breast for two that recalls in execution and plating some of the Modernist work of Franey\u2019s old boss, the New York chef Daniel Humm, of Eleven Madison Park and the NoMad. There is hamachi sashimi on the menu now as well as seared South Atlantic sea bass with sunchokes and quinoa.         \n\nOf course, the steaks and salmon remain. And so, crucially, does the Canlis salad, a menu highlight from the restaurant\u2019s very first night, a dish that Brian Canlis sometimes tells people is literally in his genes, his mother craved and ate so much of it when she was pregnant with him.         \n\nThe Canlis is in some measure a basic steakhouse salad: chopped romaine with bacon and croutons and cherry tomatoes, all cloaked in a thick, lemony dressing that recalls Caesar (you all did love him once, and not without cause). But a strong scent of the Middle East flows through it as well, courtesy of the Canlis clan\u2019s roots in Greece and Lebanon, with heaps of chopped mint and oregano mixed in with the greens. These combine with the bright, eggy taste of the dressing to elevate the entirety far beyond the confines of a salad to be eaten simply with meat and potatoes. A Canlis salad, properly prepared, is a revelation.         \n\nIt is not hard to prepare. Start with some good, fresh, crisp romaine, and wash and dry it well, then place it in the refrigerator to cool. Fry up some bacon bits and make fresh croutons in the remaining fat. Slice some scallions thin. Chop mint roughly \u2014 just enough, as the chef Fergus Henderson writes about parsley, to discipline it \u2014 and do the same with the oregano. In a large bowl in which you will eventually toss the salad, squeeze a large lemon through a sieve to catch the seeds and add to this a half-cup of the best olive oil you can find.         \n\nNow some magic. Set a kettle on the stove to boil water and, when it has, place a fresh egg in a coffee cup and pour the boiling water over it. Look at the clock. When 60 seconds have passed, fish out the egg with a spoon and rinse it in cold water until cool. Crack the egg into the oil and lemon juice and whisk to emulsify, then salt and pepper to taste.         \n\nAn egg so barely cooked \u2014 \u201ccoddled\u201d is the English term \u2014 thickens the dressing beautifully and covers the greens in a silky coat. You may always make your salad dressing this way, moving forward.         \n\nToss the salad with the dressing and add to it the croutons, the tomatoes, the bacon and a healthy shower of grated Romano cheese, sharp and salty. \u201cIf you eat the salad and it disappoints you,\u201d Mark Canlis told me, \u201cthe dressing lacks lemon or the salad lacks mint.\u201d There is no other possibility.
