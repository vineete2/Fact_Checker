{"headline": "Obama Urges Young Israelis to Lead the Push for Peace", "body": "\nJERUSALEM \u2014  \n, appealing to very disparate audiences to solve one of the world\u2019s thorniest problems, moved closer on Thursday to the Israeli government\u2019s position on resuming long-stalled peace talks with the  \n, even as he passionately implored young Israelis to get ahead of their own leaders in the push for peace.         \n\nAddressing an enthusiastic crowd of more than 2,000, Mr. Obama offered a fervent, unsparing case for why a peace agreement was both morally just and in  \n\u2019s self-interest. Younger Israelis, Mr. Obama said, should empathize with their Palestinian neighbors living under occupation \u2014 or, as he put it, \u201clook at the world through their eyes.\u201d         \n\nHours earlier, visiting the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Mr. Obama urged the Palestinians to return to the bargaining table even if Israel did not meet their condition of halting construction of Jewish settlements in Palestinian territories \u2014 a demand he, too, made at the start of his first term, but which had only a temporary, partial impact.         \n\nIt was a striking mix of big-stage inspiration and closed-door compromise: with the Palestinian president,  \n, and Prime Minister  \n, Mr. Obama was laboring to nudge two stubborn adversaries; with a younger generation, he was going over the two men\u2019s heads, seeking to stir popular enthusiasm for his vision of peace.         \n\nYet it also attested to the intractable nature of Middle East peacemaking over the past decade. By not renewing his demand that Israel halt settlement construction to get a new round of talks started, Mr. Obama was, in effect, conceding that years of careful study about how to nudge the peace process forward had failed to produce tangible results.         \n\n\u201cSpeaking as a politician, I can promise you this: political leaders will not take risks if the people do not demand that they do,\u201d Mr. Obama said, in tones reminiscent of his own political campaigns at home. \u201cYou must create the change that you want to see.\u201d         \n\nStanding before a blue-and-white banner emblazoned with the emblem of the Israeli state \u2014 a menorah flanked by olive branches \u2014 Mr. Obama spoke of the past and the future, from the biblical story of Exodus and from Theodor Herzl, the founder of modern Zionism, to Israel\u2019s reputation as a high-tech incubator with a mania for social media.         \n\n\u201cIsrael,\u201d he said to prolonged applause, \u201cis rooted not just in history and tradition, but also in a simple and profound idea: the idea that people deserve to be free in a land of their own.\u201d         \n\nMr. Obama\u2019s warm reception, after a polite but formal welcome by Mr. Netanyahu, recalled a visit by the Israeli prime minister to Washington in May 2011. Mr. Netanyahu, after rebuffing a peace proposal by Mr. Obama, spoke to Congress, receiving 29 standing ovations.         \n\nThis week, Mr. Obama avoided proposals but promised that his administration would do its part to advance the process. He is sending Secretary of State John Kerry back to Israel from Jordan on Saturday to meet again with Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Abbas to discuss next steps.         \n\nThe president\u2019s new activism, on the second day of a four-day trip to the Middle East, came hours after rockets from the Palestinian enclave of Gaza hit southern Israel. He condemned the attacks, which broke a three-month cease-fire, but said that the Israelis should not use the violence as an excuse to avoid negotiations.         \n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to succeed, part of what we\u2019re going to have to do is to get out of some of the formulas and habits that have blocked progress for so long,\u201d Mr. Obama said, as Mr. Abbas stood next to him somberly. \u201cBoth sides are going to have to think anew.\u201d         \n\nFor his part, Mr. Abbas reiterated the Palestinian demand that Israel stop settlement construction. But he did not explicitly cite that as a precondition for entering into face-to-face talks with Mr. Netanyahu. Such talks have been quiescent since 2010.         \n\n\u201cIt is the duty of the Israeli government to at least halt the activity, so we can speak of the issues,\u201d Mr. Abbas said in Arabic, speaking through an interpreter. \u201cThe issue of settlements is clear: we never gave up our vision, whether now or previously.\u201d         \n\nThere are signs that Mr. Abbas may be ready to return to negotiations with the Israelis. A draft copy of his talking points for the session with Mr. Obama, obtained by The New York Times, suggested that he was prepared to soften his long-held demand that Mr. Netanyahu publicly halt all building of settlements in favor of private assurances.         \n\nA senior administration official declined to discuss details of the meeting between Mr. Obama and Mr. Abbas.
