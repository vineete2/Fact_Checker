{"headline": "With No Shortcut to a Green Card, Gay Couples Leave U.S.", "body": "\nNot long ago, Brandon Perlberg had a growing law practice and a Manhattan apartment he shared with his partner, who is British. They hosted themed dinner parties and wine tastings for a wide circle of friends.         \n\nBut Mr. Perlberg, an American who is gay, now lives in London. Early last year he reluctantly left his law firm, rented out his apartment and said goodbye to friends. After nearly seven years in the United States on legal but temporary visas, his partner had not been able to obtain a visa as a permanent resident. The two were facing the possibility of permanent separation.         \n\nAmericans with a foreign-born spouse of the opposite sex are able to get them resident visas, or green cards, with relative ease. But federal law does not allow Americans to petition for green cards for same-sex spouses or partners. Eventually, they face a choice of remaining in the country with the immigrant here illegally or leaving the United States.         \n\n\u201cUltimately, we resolved that staying together was the most important thing for us,\u201d Mr. Perlberg said. \u201cAnd the only way to guarantee that we got to stay together was by making this move.\u201d         \n\nMr. Perlberg is part of a diaspora of gay Americans who have found they had to uproot and leave the country to continue to live with foreign partners. And this year, binational gay couples like his are a new \u2014 and controversial \u2014 focus of the debate in Washington on an ambitious overhaul of  \n laws. In a blueprint that President Obama presented last month, he pledged to give citizens, and also immigrants who are legal residents, the ability to petition for a green card for a same-sex foreign partner, if they can show they have \u201ca permanent relationship.\u201d         \n\nThe Supreme Court will also take up same-sex issues this year, with hearings in March on two cases that challenge the definition of marriage as being a union between only a man and a woman. One case deals directly with a 1996 statute, the Defense of Marriage Act, that prohibits the federal government from recognizing  \n and governs the exclusion of gay couples from visas and other immigration benefits.         \n\nThe politics of same-sex marriage are rapidly shifting, with polls showing Americans viewing it increasingly favorably but still divided. Many Republican voters strongly oppose it. Leading Republican lawmakers have questioned whether Congress should include such a hotly disputed issue in the debate when it will also wrangle with giving legal status to 11 million illegal immigrants.         \n\n\u201cThere are so many other, bigger issues the Congress has to resolve in immigration reform before we would even get to a point where we would be discussing a change to a longstanding policy like this,\u201d said Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the highest-ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is working to prepare immigration legislation.         \n\nThe restrictions in the marriage act, known as DOMA, have a direct impact on Americans with foreign-born spouses or partners who want to live in the United States.         \n\n\u201cA straight couple living in the U.S. can apply for a green card based on their spousal relationship,\u201d said Rachel B. Tiven, the executive director of Immigration Equality, a legal advocacy group focusing on gay men and lesbians. \u201cGay couples simply can\u2019t do that.\u201d         \n\nFor the first time, in Mr. Obama\u2019s blueprint, same-sex couples have been included in a comprehensive framework for immigration legislation.         \n\nThe president \u201chas long believed that Americans with same-sex partners from other countries should not be faced with the painful choice between staying with the person they love or staying in the country they love,\u201d the White House spokesman, Jay Carney, said when Mr. Obama announced his plan in Las Vegas on Jan. 29.         \n\nThe president\u2019s proposal was echoed in a bill introduced last week in the Senate by Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, a Democrat who is the Judiciary Committee chairman, and Susan Collins of Maine, a Republican. A similar bill was introduced in the House of Representatives this month.         \n\nMr. Perlberg, 34, has been following the debate in Washington from the apartment in London where he landed with his partner, Benn Robert Storey, 31. In a telephone interview, they recalled that Mr. Storey had never felt like an exile during the years they lived together in New York. A graphic designer, Mr. Storey already had a job and a work visa lined up when he moved to the United States.         \n\n\u201cI did not feel like a British person in New York, I felt like a New Yorker,\u201d Mr. Storey said. \u201cAnd during that time, my relationship with Brandon grew stronger and stronger.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/18/us/with-no-shortcut-to-a-green-card-gay-couples-leave-us.html", "date": "2013-02-17", "description": "Federal laws do not let Americans get green cards for same-sex partners, so often the immigrant must choose to stay illegally or the couple must move."}
