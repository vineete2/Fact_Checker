{"headline": "To Venezuelans, Heir of Ch\u00e1vez Is a Poor Copy", "body": "\nCARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 The start of the season for two premier teams in this baseball-loving nation was thrown into doubt after thieves stripped vast amounts of copper wire from the lights in this city\u2019s main stadium. Basic items are often so hard to find that when a truck driver slumped dead at the wheel after a highway accident last week, motorcycle-riding looters swarmed in to grab the cargo: tons of red meat.         \n\nPrices are soaring, the country is plagued by electrical blackouts, some neighborhoods go days without water, and protests tangle the already stifling traffic. To top it all off, the cheap beer that helps people let off steam at many a weekend party has suddenly become scarce, too.         \n\nNearly seven months after the death of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the country\u2019s longtime leftist president and father figure, there is a growing sense that things are falling apart.         \n\nThe new president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, has revived a longtime scapegoat for the country\u2019s woes, accusing Washington of conspiring with other enemies of the government in waging an \u201ceconomic war\u201d that has subjected the populace to blackouts, chronic shortages and other ills. Borrowing from Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s script, Mr. Maduro on Monday  \n and two other embassy officials, contending that they were plotting to destabilize the country.         \n\nBut while Mr. Ch\u00e1vez skillfully portrayed the United States as an imperialist bully and cast himself in the role of underdog hero, many Ch\u00e1vez supporters are finding Mr. Maduro\u2019s attempts to imitate his mentor unconvincing.         \n\n\u201cThis is the biggest mistake Ch\u00e1vez ever made,\u201d said Axel Ortiz, 20, a student, referring to Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s choice of Mr. Maduro as his successor. Mr. Ortiz still defines himself as a Chavista \u2014 a loyal Ch\u00e1vez supporter \u2014 but he questioned Mr. Maduro\u2019s ability to solve the nation\u2019s problems. \u201cCh\u00e1vez was the only one who was qualified, the only one who could keep things here under control.\u201d         \n\nThe country\u2019s economic problems have become acute. Inflation in the first eight months of this year was more than triple the rate in the same period last year. When measured over the 12 months that ended in August, it exceeded 45 percent. A government indicator that measures the scarcity of basic goods is close to its highest level in more than five years.         \n\nMany stores allow customers to buy only a limited number of scarce items like corn flour and cooking oil. People complain of having to stand in line for hours, often in vain, and many are losing patience with the government\u2019s explanation that unsavory conspirators are to blame for the nation\u2019s problems.         \n\n\u201cThe government is resorting to more and more outrageous and extravagant actions and statements to control the agenda,\u201d said Andr\u00e9s Ca\u00f1izalez, a communications professor at Andr\u00e9s Bello Catholic University.         \n\nAll of this would be a lot to handle for any neophyte president, but the gaffe-prone Mr. Maduro has come under withering criticism for regularly tripping over his words, eliciting cringes from supporters and jeers from opponents. When he fell off his bicycle on live television recently, the event threatened to become a metaphor for a struggling presidency.         \n\n\u201cPeople laugh at him,\u201d said Mar\u00eda L\u00f3pez, 32, a mother of two on a recent morning in the Terrazas del Alba slum in the center of Caracas. She voted for Mr. Maduro, and said she still supported him. But she fought back a smirk when asked about Mr. Maduro\u2019s bicycle accident, which occurred during a ride to promote his party\u2019s youth movement. \u201cWe don\u2019t want a president who\u2019s a joke,\u201d she said.         \n\nThe blunders have piled up, much like the entourage of politicians and bodyguards who screeched to a halt in a tangle behind the president\u2019s fallen bicycle.         \n\nIn one of his most infamous verbal flubs, in August, Mr. Maduro sought to make a reference to the biblical story of Jesus\u2019 multiplying the loaves and fishes \u2014 only to have it come out of his mouth as \u201cthe multiplication of the penises.\u201d Mr. Maduro apparently conflated \u201cpeces\u201d (fish) and \u201cpanes\u201d (loaves) to produce \u201cpenes\u201d (penises). He quickly apologized and corrected himself, but the damage was done.         \n\n\u201cA person who doesn\u2019t know how to speak will never know how to run a country,\u201d said Jorge Flores, 30, a messenger at a government-run hospital, who voted for Mr. Maduro but now bitterly regrets doing so.         \n\n\u201cThis is the worst government I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Mr. Flores said. \u201cThe best government we\u2019ve ever had here was with Ch\u00e1vez.\u201d         \n\nMr. Maduro calls his critics elitists and once said he had misspoken on purpose to bait his detractors.
