{"headline": "Pressure Grows to Create Drugs for \u2018Superbugs\u2019", "body": "\nGovernment officials, drug companies and medical experts, faced with outbreaks of  \n-resistant \u201csuperbugs,\u201d are pushing to speed up the approval of new antibiotics, a move that is raising safety concerns among some critics.         \n\nThe need for new antibiotics is so urgent, supporters of an overhaul say, that lengthy studies involving hundreds or thousands of patients should be waived in favor of directly testing such drugs in very sick patients. Influential lawmakers have said they are prepared to support legislation that allows for faster testing.         \n\nThe  \n last month announced an agreement under which it will pay $40 million to a major drug maker, GlaxoSmithKline, to help it develop medications to combat antibiotic resistance and biological agents that terrorists might use. Under the plan, the federal government could give the drug company as much as $200 million over the next five years.         \n\n\u201cWe are facing a huge crisis worldwide not having an antibiotics pipeline,\u201d said Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research at the  \n. \u201cIt is bad now, and the infectious disease docs are frantic. But what is worse is the thought of where we will be five to 10 years from now.\u201d         \n\nAnnually, tens of thousands of Americans die from infections, largely acquired in hospitals, that are resistant to antibiotics, experts say.         \n\nDoctors, faced with dwindling options and little time to decide, are often left with agonizing choices over how to save a patient\u2019s life. For example, some doctors, in extreme cases, are again using Colistin, an older antibiotic that was largely abandoned years ago because of the damage it can cause the kidneys.         \n\n\u201cA drug like Colistin would not be developed today because it is too toxic,\u201d said Dr. Helen W. Boucher, an infectious disease expert at Tufts University in Boston.         \n\nUnder a plan proposed by a professional medical group, the Infectious Disease Society of America, new antibiotics approved through quicker testing would carry a special label specifying that their use be limited to very sick patients.         \n\nBut critics of the plan argue that merely putting a restrictive label on a medicine is not enough, and that limited tests might not be adequate to determine a drug\u2019s safety and effectiveness. They say they worry that the new medications, without the more comprehensive testing, could then be used on healthier patients who do not necessarily need them.         \n\n\u201cThere is really no way of knowing how these drugs are going to perform,\u201d said Dr. John H. Powers, a former F.D.A. antibiotics reviewer who is now an associate professor at George Washington University in Washington.         \n\nThe overuse of antibiotics in people and animals, often for conditions for which the drugs are ineffective or not needed, is seen as a driving force in the development of resistant bacteria. As these organisms have evolved and developed resistance, the development of new drugs has not kept pace.         \n\nPharmaceutical companies have frequently chosen to put their resources into developing drugs with bigger payoffs than antibiotics. Also, the F.D.A., after a scandal several years ago involving an antibiotic called Ketek, which the agency approved on the basis of fraudulent data and was subsequently  \n, has been cautious in approving new drugs, infectious disease experts say.         \n\n\u201cIt has been progressively more difficult to usher a new anti-infective to market,\u201d said Dr. Vance G. Fowler Jr., an infectious disease expert at Duke University.         \n\nEfforts to develop new antibiotics are not limited to the United States. In Europe, several big producers including GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca recently became part of a joint government and industry initiative to develop antibiotics that kill resistant strains of bacteria. As part of the project, companies are pooling their resources and research data.         \n\nAlong with the recent grant to GlaxoSmithKline, federal officials have also been giving grants to drug makers worth tens of millions of dollars to help them underwrite the costs of developing new antibiotics.         \n\nIn addition, Congress passed legislation last year that gives producers five more years of market exclusivity for effective drugs. The measure also directed the F.D.A. to review and approve new antibiotics more quickly, though it did not give specifics.         \n\nIn April, two senators, Michael F. Bennet, Democrat of Colorado, and Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, said they saw legislation as a way to circumvent the time it takes for the Food and Drug Administration to change its testing procedures. A letter they sent to the F.D.A. highlighted the plan championed by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.
