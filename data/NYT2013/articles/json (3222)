{"headline": "Toronto Mayor Admits Crack Use, as Wild Ride in Office Continues", "body": "\nTORONTO \u2014 He has been thrown out of a Toronto Maple Leafs hockey game for being drunk and belligerent. He groped a female politician at a fund-raiser for a Jewish community group, and was asked to stop coaching a high school football team after having a violent confrontation with one of the players. He has admitted to drinking too much.         \n\nBut until Tuesday, Rob Ford, the mayor of multicultural, eco-conscious, politically correct Toronto, had vehemently denied a persistent report about a video that showed him smoking crack cocaine.         \n\n\u201cYou asked me a question back in May and you can repeat that question,\u201d Mr. Ford told a crush of journalists, photographers and camera operators. \u201cYes, I have smoked crack cocaine. But no, do I, am I an addict? No. Have I tried it? Probably in one of my drunken stupors, probably approximately about a year ago.\u201d         \n\nDuring his brief, impromptu news conference outside his City Hall office, Mr. Ford, 44, insisted that he had not been lying since May, when he first denied reports that he had used crack. At that time, the blog Gawker and The Toronto Star both said their reporters had seen a video from a man trying to sell it that apparently showed the mayor inhaling from a crack pipe and making homophobic remarks about another politician.         \n\nLast week, the questions surrounding the mayor intensified after Toronto\u2019s police chief, William Blair, said his force had recovered the video from a computer seized in a drug and gang violence investigation.         \n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t lying; you didn\u2019t ask the correct questions,\u201d Mr. Ford said Tuesday. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not an addict and no, I do not do drugs. I made mistakes in the past and all I can do is apologize, but it is what it is.\u201d         \n\nIn a tumultuous four-year term that will draw to a close next year, Mr. Ford has been accused of a litany of boorish actions, profane outbursts and insensitive comments \u2014 so many, in fact, that one of his critics felt the need to  \n to keep track of them all.         \n\nBut until this one, the episodes only seemed to reinforce Mr. Ford\u2019s standing among his core constituency, what he calls the Ford Nation, of disenchanted, right-of-center suburbanites. Now his mayoralty is in serious doubt.         \n\nMr. Ford\u2019s switch from outraged denial to confession was dramatic and swift. On a weekly radio talk show on Sunday, which the mayor hosts with his brother Doug, who is also a member of City Council, Mr. Ford apologized, somewhat vaguely, for occasionally getting drunk, but avoided the cocaine issue.         \n\nIt was not clear why the mayor changed course on Tuesday. But Mr. Ford\u2019s confession only increased the calls from members of City Council, opponents and allies alike for him to step down, at least temporarily.         \n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s lost the moral authority to lead,\u201d Denzil Minnan-Wong, a longtime supporter, told reporters outside the mayor\u2019s office shortly after the confession. \u201cWe\u2019re in uncharted territory.\u201d         \n\nUnder Ontario municipal law, however, neither the City Council nor the province have the power to remove Mr. Ford from office unless he stops coming to work for a protracted period.         \n\nSince May, both Mr. Ford and his brother have rejected the drug allegations as little more than a smear campaign by the news media, which he has dismissed as \u201cmaggots,\u201d reserving his strongest vitriol for The Toronto Star.         \n\nAbout two hours before the mayor\u2019s admission, Doug Ford extended his attack toward Chief Blair, who during  \n said of the video, \u201cAs a citizen of the city, I am disappointed.\u201d         \n\nDoug Ford, his hands noticeably trembling, said at a news conference that the remark showed that the police chief was biased and called for him to step aside until after all investigations related to the mayor are finished.         \n\nRob Ford, who was not initially regarded as a serious mayoral candidate in 2010, focused heavily on issues that resonated with disgruntled suburban voters, many of whom had lost their jobs because of factory closings in Toronto in the past decade.         \n\nToronto had long developed policies to limit private automobile use in favor of buses, subways and streetcars. But Mr. Ford vowed to end the city\u2019s \u201cwar on cars,\u201d the preferred mode of transport for suburbanites. Ending a newly introduced municipal automobile registration tax was also high on his campaign agenda.         \n\nBut most of all, Mr. Ford declared that the city\u2019s prosperous, growing downtown was filled with spoiled elites who were robbing suburbanites of tax dollars to their own ends.         \n\nCombined with the decision of the previous mayor, David Miller, not to seek re-election and the votes split between liberal candidates, Mr. Ford emerged as mayor.
