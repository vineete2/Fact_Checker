{"headline": "As Obama Pauses Action, Putin Takes Center Stage", "body": "\nMOSCOW \u2014 President Vladimir V. Putin has been many things to President Obama: a partner at times, an irritant more often, the host of the elusive Edward J. Snowden and \u201cthe bored kid in the back of the classroom\u201d who offered so little on the administration\u2019s foreign policy goals that Mr. Obama canceled plans to hold a summit meeting in Moscow last week.         \n\nYet suddenly Mr. Putin has eclipsed Mr. Obama as the world leader driving the agenda in the Syria crisis. He is offering a potential, if still highly uncertain, alternative to what he has vocally criticized as America\u2019s militarism and reasserted Russian interests in a region where it had been marginalized since the collapse of the Soviet Union.         \n\nAlthough circumstances could shift yet again, Mr. Putin appears to have achieved several objectives, largely at Washington\u2019s expense. He has handed a diplomatic lifeline to his longtime ally in Syria, President Bashar al-Assad, who not long ago appeared at risk of losing power and who President Obama twice said must step down. He has stopped Mr. Obama from going around the United Nations Security Council, where Russia holds a veto, to assert American priorities unilaterally.         \n\nMore generally, Russia has at least for now made itself indispensable in containing the conflict in Syria, which Mr. Putin has argued could ignite Islamic unrest around the region, even as far as Russia\u2019s own restive Muslim regions, if it is mismanaged. He has boxed Mr. Obama into treating Moscow as an essential partner for much of the next year, if Pentagon estimates of the time it will take to secure Syria\u2019s chemical weapons stockpile are accurate.         \n\n\u201cPutin probably had his best day as president in years yesterday,\u201d Ian Bremmer, the president of  \n, a political risk consultancy, said in a conference call on Wednesday, \u201cand I suspect he\u2019s enjoying himself right now.\u201d         \n\nIn an  \n in The New York Times released on Wednesday, Mr. Putin laid down a strong challenge to Mr. Obama\u2019s vision of how to address the turmoil, arguing that a military strike risked \u201cspreading the conflict far beyond Syria\u2019s borders\u201d and would violate international law, undermining postwar stability.         \n\n\u201cIt is alarming that military intervention in internal conflicts in foreign countries has become commonplace for the United States,\u201d Mr. Putin wrote. \u201cIs it in America\u2019s long-term interest? I doubt it.\u201d         \n\nWhen Mr. Putin returned to the presidency a year ago, he moved aggressively to stamp out a growing protest movement and silence competing and independent voices. He shored up his position at home but, as his government promoted nationalism with a hostile edge, passed antigay legislation, locked up illegal immigrants in a city camp, kept providing arms to the Syrian government and ultimately gave refuge to the leaker Mr. Snowden, Mr. Putin was increasingly seen in the West as a calloused, out-of-touch modern-day czar.         \n\nNow he appears to be relishing a role as a statesman. His spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said in an interview that the Russian president was not seeking \u201cownership of the initiative,\u201d but wanted only to promote a political solution to head off a wider military conflict in the Middle East.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only the beginning of the road,\u201d Mr. Peskov said, \u201cbut it\u2019s a very important beginning.\u201d         \n\nTo get started, Mr. Putin sent his foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, to Geneva on Thursday to meet with Secretary of State John Kerry, in hopes of hammering out the myriad logistical details of putting a sprawling network of chemical sites under international control in the middle of a deadly civil war.         \n\nEven that step was another indication of just how much the circumstances have changed in such a short time. Only a week ago, Mr. Putin was accusing Mr. Kerry of lying to Congress about the presence of militants allied with Al Qaeda in Syria. \u201cHe\u2019s lying,\u201d he said in televised remarks. \u201cAnd he knows he\u2019s lying. It\u2019s sad.\u201d         \n\nOn Wednesday, when Russia submitted a package of proposals to the Americans and others ahead of that meeting in Geneva, Mr. Peskov again used the opportunity to try to paint Russia as the peacemaker to the United States\u2019 war maker. Mr. Peskov declined to release details of the plan, other than to say Russia\u2019s most important condition was that Syria\u2019s willingness to give up its weapons could only be tested if the United States refrained from the retaliation Mr. Obama has threatened. \u201cAny strike will make this impossible,\u201d Mr. Peskov said.
