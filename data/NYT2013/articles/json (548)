{"headline": "Homes Keep Rising in West Despite Growing Wildfire Threat", "body": "\nThe death of 19 firefighters in Arizona this week highlights what has become a fact of life in the West: Every summer, smoke fills the big skies yet people continue to build in the places that burn most. More people live in these areas, and many balk at controls on how and where to build.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a self-selection factor in there \u2014 people who don\u2019t want the government to do things tend to move to places where the government isn\u2019t around to do things,\u201d said Don Elliott, a senior consultant at Clarion Associates, a land-use consulting firm.         \n\nJust as many Easterners resist stepping back from their increasingly flooded coast, Westerners build where they want to build.         \n\nIn a report last September, CoreLogic, a business analytics company,  \n that 740,000 homes in 13 Western states, with a total value of $136 billion, were at high or very high risk of burning up. Nationwide, Oregon and Wisconsin researchers found, 98.5 million people lived in 43.7 million homes in what is known as  \n or WUI (pronounced woo-ee) in 2010.         \n\nThe sentiment that people should build where and how they choose is embedded in the Bitterroot Valley of western Montana, where a series of  \n helped usher in the era of ever-more-dangerous Western wildfires.         \n\nSeventy houses were destroyed, and one flare-up left Becky Koon, a landscape designer and local school volunteer, briefly frantic over the fate of her 13-year-old daughter, who, oblivious to the sudden danger, was sunbathing at a friend\u2019s house. The girls were rescued, and Ms. Koon has since tried to help people there lower their risk by reaching out with information about brush- and tree-clearing and other ways to make their homes safer.         \n\nBut she remains frustrated. \u201cIt\u2019s a mixed bag,\u201d was the best she could say of the reception her neighbors in Ravalli County, Mont., had given her efforts. This is a county whose voters decisively rejected a proposal to initiate local zoning and that prides itself on its log cabins and the fervent belief that government should stay out of people\u2019s lives.         \n\nAlmost 15,700 of Ravalli County\u2019s 19,000 homes are built where fires are likely, according to 2010 data compiled by  \n at the University of Wisconsin and Oregon State University. That is nearly double the 8,062 houses in the same area in 1990. Currently, more than 32,000 of the 40,212 people in the county live in the WUI.         \n\nYet in Ravalli County, the Board of Commissioners  \n to adopt new maps of this interface, in the face of objections from homeowners and real estate agents that it would depress property values, increase insurance rates and lead to regulation.         \n\nAs Greg Chilcott, a county commissioner, said in an interview: \u201cRegulatory intrusion is a concern. We have somewhat adopted the philosophy, in my mind, that informing citizens of the risk of their choices as to where they build their homes is what our job is \u2014 rather than regulating them out of their homes or away from their lands.\u201d         \n\nMany came from urban areas, he said. \u201cTheir romantic vision of the house or cabin in the woods was great \u2014 especially when they drive up the gravel road in April and May,\u201d he said. \u201cThen rolls in July and August when the gravel road turns to dust and the smoke and flames are threatening their dream home. They didn\u2019t understand the seasons in the Rocky Mountain Northwest.\u201d         \n\nSome, he said, accept the risks and the consequences. Others \u201cwill demand to be made whole by someone else,\u201d often the federal government, whose forest management is sometimes blamed for residential losses.         \n\nRavalli County\u2019s resistance to controls either by governments or insurers is hardly unique among the Western States.         \n\nIn fire-prone areas of California, Colorado, Texas, New Mexico and Arizona, the increase in wildfires has been exacerbated by climate-change-driven droughts and beetle infestations that turn evergreen forests into red tree graveyards. But construction has continued apace.         \n\n\u201cUp until 2006 to 2008, the trend accelerated,\u201d said Roger Hammer, a sociology professor at Oregon State University who has studied the issue for years. He called the recession \u201ca speed bump\u201d that \u201cisn\u2019t going to change the trend at all.\u201d         \n\nBut some of the more heavily inhabited places have started to change. The fierceness of recent fires in places like liberal Boulder, Colo., and conservative Colorado Springs changed minds. This year,  \nrequired fire-resistant construction materials in such areas. Colorado Springs used WUI maps as the basis for  \n on hillside construction.         \n\nAnd Colorado\u2019s governor, John W. Hickenlooper, this year  \n two public-private task forces to look at the issue of how to deal with fire risks.         \n\n\u201cOne of the things we\u2019re looking at is, should there be fee assessments if you\u2019re living in that area, to support wildfire-fighting efforts?\u201d said Kelly Campbell, a member of one of the commissions and a vice president of the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America.
