{"headline": "Weiner Admits to More Lewd Exchanges but Denies an Addiction", "body": "\n \n entered a dark and chaotic phase on Thursday as he admitted to having explicit online relationships with at least three women since he left Congress, and the woman at the center of the latest scandal appeared on television, remembering him as a \u201cperpetually horny middle-aged man.\u201d         \n\nMr. Weiner, appearing shaken and at times rambling as he faced reporters, revised his previous estimate of the total number of women with whom he had engaged in sexual encounters online to 10, up from 6.         \n\nBut in a sign of how difficult the furor over his behavior may be to contain, he made clear he could not say for certain how many women or lewd images might yet surface.         \n\n\u201cThere are more than \u2014 there are a few,\u201d Mr. Weiner, a Democrat, said with a stammer. \u201cI don\u2019t have a specific number for you.\u201d Later, he tried to explain the sequence of his Internet relationships: \u201cSometimes they didn\u2019t go consistently. Whatever.\u201d         \n\nMr. Weiner\u2019s once-resurgent political standing in New York City seemed to erode by the moment, as more graphic pictures of his penis appeared online and his conduct and lack of candor were denounced from the campaign trail to the halls of Congress.         \n\nRepresentative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California and the minority leader, described Mr. Weiner\u2019s behavior as \u201creprehensible; it\u2019s so disrespectful of women.\u201d Even Mr. Weiner\u2019s rank-and-file donors said they were disillusioned by the disclosures that had recast the candidate who they viewed as a liberal hero into a habitually misbehaving and misleading figure.         \n\n\u201cThis kind of behavior is very bad,\u201d said Kishore Belani, the owner of a video company in Queens who recently contributed to Mr. Weiner\u2019s campaign. \u201cI don\u2019t think that he deserves another chance.\u201d         \n\n\u201cI have children,\u201d Mr. Belani added. \u201cFor children, this is not a good politician to learn from.\u201d         \n\nThe accounting of online flirtations offered by Mr. Weiner, 48, on Thursday, while at times awkward, was the most detailed he has provided since he resigned from office in 2011, vowing to learn from his mistakes, reconcile with his wife and seek therapy.         \n\nWhen he re-emerged this spring, asking for a second chance to serve the public, he portrayed himself as a rehabilitated figure who since his resignation had reflected on his past errors and abandoned his habit of sending lewd messages and photos to strangers he met online.         \n\nBut those claims were belied by a series of  \n this week.  \n that he had initiated explicit exchanges with a young woman from Indiana a year after he had resigned, using the alias \u201cCarlos Danger\u201d; and on Thursday, he acknowledged doing the same with two more women during the same period.         \n\nThe latest revelations jolted a candidate who had improbably climbed to the top of polls, and they invited searing attacks from rivals and the city\u2019s political establishment.         \n\n\u201cTo me, he has committed the cardinal sins: those are, lying to the public,\u201d said Richard D. Emery, a civil rights and election lawyer in New York who is supporting Public Advocate Bill de Blasio, who is also seeking the Democratic nomination for mayor. \u201cLots of politicians do it, but he has done it in a way that reaches new heights of hypocrisy.\u201d         \n\nMr. Weiner, he said, \u201chas really forfeited his right to participate in the election.\u201d         \n\nAdding to the melodrama, Sydney Leathers, the Indiana woman with whom Mr. Weiner connected for his most recent online escapade, emerged publicly,  \n the tabloid television show, to describe their relationship, which lasted months and continued even as he made plans to run for mayor.         \n\nMs. Leathers, 23, a Democratic activist who once revered Mr. Weiner for his strident voice on liberal causes, accused him of lying to his wife and to the public about ending his online dalliance.         \n\n\u201cI\u2019m disgusted by him,\u201d she told the show. \u201cHe\u2019s not who I thought he was.\u201d         \n\n \n, Ms. Leathers was asked whether she told Mr. Weiner that she loved him. \u201cYes,\u201d she replied. Asked if Mr. Weiner had said he loved her, she replied, \u201cYes.\u201d         \n\nShe urged Mr. Weiner to leave the campaign. \u201cStop lying, stop embarrassing his wife and get help,\u201d she said.         \n\nMr. Weiner said on Thursday that he was still seeking professional help for his online behavior, and that he did not believe he had an addiction.         \n\nHe made his comments as he tried to shift the spotlight from his personal life to his policy ideas, by going to a soup kitchen in Brooklyn to lay out his plan to appoint a cabinet-level official to oversee nonprofit groups in the city.         \n\n\u201cI want to return to having a conversation,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll have a chance to.\u201d         \n\nBut questions about his character kept cropping up. After he accused a Democratic rival, Christine C. Quinn, of misleading the public on changing term limits, Ms. Quinn, who is the City Council speaker, questioned his fitness for public office at a news conference in Lower Manhattan.         \n\nShe went after him for a \u201cpattern of reckless behavior\u201d and his \u201csignificant challenge with telling the truth.\u201d         \n\nEven as his opponents and the \n his bid for mayor, his most ardent supporters said they would overlook his failings.         \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s completely irrelevant to his ability to be mayor,\u201d said Adam R. Rose, co-president of Rose Associates, a real estate management company and a donor to Mr. Weiner\u2019s campaign. \u201cMy support for Anthony is unwavering.\u201d         \n\nBut some longtime supporters, alarmed by the continuing commotion, said they could no longer stomach his candidacy.         \n\n\u201cThe man needs to look himself in the mirror and say, \u2018Really?\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Maryanne Adams, a donor to his campaign from New Hampshire, who said she had admired his outspoken support for overhauling health care. \u201cGrow up.\u201d         \n\nShe was already starting to talk about his campaign in the past tense. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad,\u201d she said. \u201cSo much talent wasted.\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/26/nyregion/weiner-admits-more-online-exchanges-with-women-after-quitting-house.html", "date": "2013-07-25", "description": "Anthony D.
