{"headline": "Drama Unfolds at My Bus Stop", "body": "\nI am in Brooklyn waiting for the bus the way most people wait for the bus: leaning dangerously over the curb, trying unsuccessfully to transform the white delivery truck in the distance into the B43. The two men driving the truck make their way down Graham Avenue, park next to me and start unpacking and eating sandwiches, while staring down the street past me.         \n\nThen, without warning, the two men stop eating, jump out of the truck and begin running toward me. An Oldsmobile drifts through my periphery and past the bus stop at exactly the speed a car moves when its driver loses consciousness and no longer has his foot on the brake. It\u2019s an unnerving speed; I finally understand why dogs hate people on Rollerblades. The driver, if you can call him that, is not moving, or blinking, or looking around dazedly \u2014 he\u2019s not doing anything.         \n\nOnce they reach the car, which is still rolling placidly, one man reaches in, puts it in park and steps back, arms folded, uncertain, surveying the situation. I walk over, and they turn to me: \u201cOh, good. You\u2019re here,\u201d one of them says. He sounds annoyed, almost, as if I am late or forgot his birthday. \u201cYou got this, right?\u201d I nod dumbly, and they are back at their truck and continue on with their sandwiches while I stare at the motionless old man in his now-motionless car.         \n\nConfidence leaks down my back in a thin stream, and I step through a series of actions absorbed from decades of watching procedural television. I call the man \u201cSir.\u201d I don\u2019t feel any breath under his nose. I tell him it\u2019s going to be all right, as if I believe it.         \n\nI am dialing with one hand, while the other prods about his face and shoulders searching for the spot on the neck where the artery (vein?) runs close enough to the surface to feel a pulse, and I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m inept or if blood is simply not moving. He almost seems to be cooling down as I touch him, as if some internal furnace has been shut off and he\u2019s becoming the temperature of the rest of the world.         \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the nature of your emergency?\u201d the woman from 911 asks.         \n\n\u201cIs he breathing?\u201d I don\u2019t think so.         \n\n\u201cDoes he have a pulse?\u201d I explain about wandering around his neck and the heat being turned off, and she sighs as if the whole world is useless, tells me the emergency services are on their way and hangs up on me.         \n\nThe fire truck arrives first.         \n\nThe police car arrives second.         \n\nThe ambulance third.         \n\nThen the second and third police cars arrive. They all park at odd angles to the street.         \n\nI stand there as the paramedics expertly maneuver the man onto the stretcher. The mask they put over his face is attached to a rubber bulb that reminds me of the squeezable end of my grandmother\u2019s perfume atomizer, which filled her bathroom with the scent of lavender. They force air into the man, expanding and contracting his chest like an air mattress failing to inflate.         \n\nThey trundle him into the ambulance as a police officer asks me what I\u2019m doing there, telling me to move along. He actually says, \u201cMove along.\u201d         \n\n\u201cBut I called it in,\u201d I say, using TV vernacular. \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to leave the scene of an accident.\u201d The cop stares through me for a moment. \u201cThis isn\u2019t an accident,\u201d he says, and I half expect him to follow the procedural script and say, \u201cThis is a tragedy,\u201d but it\u2019s not even that; it\u2019s just someone dying, or possibly dying, or maybe he\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll never find out what happened to the man. I\u2019m just an extra.         \n\nThe cop climbs into his cruiser and is gone. Then the ambulance is gone. The fire truck. The delivery men finish their sandwiches, and the truck departs as well.         \n\nI look at my watch. It has been 25 minutes since someone\u2019s Oldsmobile rolled oddly to a halt. Now the set is clear, the city\u2019s clockwork restored.         \n\nThere ought to be an indelible spot in the road marking the event. But if there were a mark for this one moment, there would be marks for all such moments, and the whole city would grow black with spots like the tarred chewing gum on subway platforms. And we would notice the marks as little as we do that gum. So there may as well be nothing.         \n\nI can\u2019t tell if this is sad or not. I think it\u2019s liberating.         \n\nThe B43 comes, and I am gone as well.
