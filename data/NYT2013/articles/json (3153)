{"headline": "A Bombing Suspect, and the Rush to Judgment", "body": "\n \n         \n\nATLANTA \u2014 I have perhaps never been so furious with an editor. Those who know me well recognize that this is quite an assertion.         \n\nIt was late in the afternoon of July 30, 1996, and as a national correspondent in the Atlanta bureau of The New York Times I had spent the last several hours frantically trying to confirm the spectacular disclosure in an \u201cextra\u201d edition of The Atlanta Journal, that Richard A. Jewell, a security guard portrayed as a heroic first responder to the  \n, was in fact the focus of the F.B.I.'s search for the bomber.         \n\nAs I was sweating my deadline, compiling everything I had learned about Mr. Jewell, word was conveyed that the paper\u2019s executive editor at the time, Joseph Lelyveld, had decreed that we would not join the news media herd in reporting that Mr. Jewell was the leading suspect. Nor would we in any way suggest that Mr. Jewell\u2019s actions or personality merited suspicion, as The Journal had in publishing, without attribution, that he \u201cfits the profile of the lone bomber.\u201d         \n\nInstead, I was to write  \n\u2013 642 words, as it ended up, less than half the length I figured it merited \u2013 about the media riot that followed The Journal\u2019s revelation. In stark contrast to front-page coverage with screaming headlines around the world, my article would be buried deep inside the next day\u2019s newspaper. This decision from New York, that we essentially were not going to compete on the biggest story on earth, rubbed against my every journalistic instinct. I felt like a pit bull tethered to a very short chain.         \n\nUnder protest, I constructed an awkward lead paragraph that remains both the worst and the best I have ever written: \u201cCoverage of the investigation of the bombing at the Olympics here was dominated for hours today by a report in The Atlanta Journal naming a local security guard as the leading suspect.\u201d The article went on to report that the networks had led their broadcasts with the news and that scores of reporters had assembled outside Mr. Jewell\u2019s apartment. After several paragraphs of this pap, I wrote that federal law enforcement sources had confirmed to The Times that Mr. Jewell was among the suspects in the bombing, but cautioned that there were others, and that there was not sufficient evidence to charge him.         \n\nWhen I picked up the newspaper off my driveway the next morning, I could not have been more dispirited about how we had handled the story.         \n\nIn retrospect, of course, the rabbinical wisdom shown by Mr. Lelyveld that afternoon, in the face of intense competitive pressure, provided one of the greatest journalistic lessons of my career. While The Times has demonstrated over the years that it is not immune to misjudgment (as the  \n), we stood out in the coverage of the Jewell story for our restraint. Mr. Lelyveld\u2019s call saved the paper, and me, from embarrassment and perhaps from the litigation that Mr. Jewell later pursued against several news organizations. There but for the grace of Joe went I.         \n\nThat nearly two decades later my profession seems to have learned so little from that cautionary tale, and that the transformation of our business by the Internet and social media has, if anything, heightened our proclivity to rush to judgment, is, of course, deeply concerning. The  \n, reporting that the F.B.I. was seeking two innocent Boston Marathon spectators in the April bombing there, is but the latest of many examples.         \n\nAs a native Southerner, and an Atlantan for much of my adulthood, I took the Olympics bombing personally. I remember getting to the park that night shortly after the explosion, in time to interview witnesses who showed off souvenirs from their evening: the nails that the real bomber \u2013 Eric Robert Rudolph \u2013 had packed into his device as shrapnel. Later that night, I ran into tearful Olympic planners who understood that their years of work had been forever despoiled. What was to be a global coming-out party for a new South changed instantaneously into something dark and disturbing. The press pass I had exploited to slip into Olympic competitions \u2013 boxing one day, table tennis the next \u2013 would now be used to attend police news conferences.         \n\nIn the ensuing weeks, I  \n. I dug into his court records, interviewed his friends, employers and lawyers, and occasionally joined the media encampment outside his apartment. It did not take long to suspect that the evidence of any wrongdoing was sparse, and that elements of timing made it all but impossible that he was the bomber. Most of my articles remained concise and poorly played, often focusing more on the  \n than on his guilt or innocence. The first to appear on Page 1 was the article three months after the bombing in which Kent B. Alexander, then the United States attorney in Atlanta and a longtime friend of mine,  \n.         \n\nA day later, I wrote a nearly 3,000-word article, also published on the front page, revealing  \n to lure Mr. Jewell into self-incrimination. I interviewed Mr. Jewell about his treatment by the news media, which he said had jumped on him \u201clike piranha on a bleeding cow.\u201d He said then, as he did in subsequent interviews, that he knew he could never get his name back.         \n\nEleven years later, in August 2007, I wrote  \n for The Times. He had died at age 44 of complications from diabetes, but it was hard, of course, not to assume that a broken spirit had contributed to his demise. Coincidentally, the obituary ran 642 words, the precise length of my initial article about the events that made him a national symbol.         \n\n***         \n\nThis week\u2019s Retro Report is the 14th in a documentary series. The video project was started with a grant from Christopher Buck. Retro Report has a staff of 13 journalists and 10 contributors led by Kyra Darnton, a former \u201c60 Minutes\u201d producer. It is a nonprofit video news organization that aims to provide a thoughtful counterweight to today\u2019s 24/7 news cycle.
