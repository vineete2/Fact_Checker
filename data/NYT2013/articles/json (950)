{"headline": "Capitol Leaders Agree to a Deal on the Budget", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 House and Senate budget negotiators reached agreement Tuesday on a budget deal that would raise military and domestic spending over the next two years, shifting the pain of across-the-board cuts to other programs over the coming decade and raising fees on airline tickets to pay for airport security.         \n\nThe deal, while modest in scope, amounts to a cease-fire in the budget wars that have debilitated Washington since 2011 and gives lawmakers breathing room to try to address the real drivers of federal spending \u2014 health care and entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security \u2014 and to reshape the tax code.         \n\nFor a Capitol used to paralyzing partisan gridlock, the accord between Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, chairman of the House Budget Committee, and Senator Patty Murray of Washington, chairwoman of the Senate Budget Committee, was a reminder that even fierce political combatants can find common ground. Mr. Ryan praised the deal in the most elementary terms as a way to \u201cget our government functioning at its very basic levels.\u201d         \n\nBoth negotiators promised an end to uncertainty and the lurching from crisis to crisis, at least for a year. But both parties sought to preserve their ability to force another showdown over fiscal matters; the government\u2019s statutory borrowing authority will lapse as early as March, another potential crisis.         \n\nThe budget deal also allows Republicans to remain focused on attacks on the health care law. And party members who are thought to have White House ambitions \u2014 like Mr. Ryan and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida \u2014 are likely to use this agreement, and future fights over money, to further their prospects in 2016.         \n\nStill, the announcement drew praise from House Republican leaders, who are likely to put it to a vote by Thursday.         \n\n\u201cWhile modest in scale, this agreement represents a positive step forward by replacing one-time spending cuts with permanent reforms to mandatory spending programs that will produce real, lasting savings,\u201d Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio said in a statement.         \n\nPresident Obama also weighed in. \u201cThis agreement doesn\u2019t include everything I\u2019d like \u2014 and I know many Republicans feel the same way. That\u2019s the nature of compromise,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a good sign that Democrats and Republicans in Congress were able to come together and break the cycle of shortsighted, crisis-driven decision making to get this done.\u201d         \n\nThe proposal quickly drew fire from conservatives who saw it as a retreat from earlier spending cuts and a betrayal by senior Republicans. Some excoriated Mr. Ryan, the party\u2019s vice-presidential nominee in 2012, for rolling back immediate spending cuts in exchange for promised savings that may never materialize.         \n\n\u201cWe need a government with less debt and an economy with more good paying jobs, and this budget fails to accomplish both goals, making it harder for more Americans to achieve the American dream,\u201d Mr. Rubio said. \u201cInstead, this budget continues Washington\u2019s irresponsible budgeting decisions by spending more money than the government takes in and placing additional financial burdens on everyday Americans.\u201d         \n\nThe agreement, which would finance the government through Sept. 30, 2015, would eliminate about $63 billion in across-the-board domestic and military cuts. But it would provide $23 billion in deficit reduction by extending a 2 percent cut to Medicare providers through 2023, two years beyond the cuts set by the Budget Control Act of 2011.         \n\nFor Democrats and their negotiator, Ms. Murray, the deal is a turning point in the spending wars that have dominated the Capitol since Republicans swept to control of the House in 2011.         \n\nFor Republicans and their negotiator, Mr. Ryan, the deal should mean the political focus can remain on Mr. Obama\u2019s health care law and not on another round of budget brinkmanship next month with the government moving to another possible shutdown.
