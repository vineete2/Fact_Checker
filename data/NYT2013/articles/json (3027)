{"headline": "Su\u00e1rez Barred 10 Games for Biting Opponent", "body": "\nLiverpool striker Luis Su\u00e1rez was suspended for 10 games by England\u2019s Football Association on Wednesday for biting an opponent during a  \n game, but the reaction of Su\u00e1rez and his club to the decision threatened to further stain the reputations of both.         \n\nA three-person F.A. panel ruled Wednesday that the standard three-match ban for violent conduct was \u201cclearly insufficient\u201d for Su\u00e1rez after he bit the arm of Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic on Sunday. Su\u00e1rez has a checkered disciplinary history: he was suspended for seven games by Dutch league officials in 2010 for an earlier biting incident and for eight games by the F.A. last season for yelling racial insults at Manchester United defender Patrice Evra.         \n\nSensing the seriousness of the latest incident, Liverpool moved quickly Sunday, apparently hoping to minimize any penalty. It released  \n soon after Sunday\u2019s game, complete with comments from his coach and the club\u2019s managing director that his conduct was \u201cnot befitting of any player wearing a Liverpool shirt.\u201d         \n\nThe club also made it known that Su\u00e1rez had apologized personally to Ivanovic in a telephone call and that he had been fined, thought to be two weeks\u2019 salary \u2014 about $350,000 in Su\u00e1rez\u2019s case. But the decision to then publicize Su\u00e1rez\u2019s request to donate the fine to the Hillsborough Families Support Group was seen even by the recipients as a transparent attempt to place a disgraced player alongside a revered section of the Liverpool fan base.         \n\nThen, on Wednesday, Liverpool\u2019s managing director, Ian Ayre, surprised many when he reacted to the 10-match ban by releasing a statement that said \u201cboth the club and player are  \n at the severity\u201d of the decision. Ayre\u2019s statement brought to mind an earlier one from the club, in late 2011, when Liverpool defiantly announced that it was \u201csurprised and disappointed\u201d at Su\u00e1rez\u2019s eight-match ban in the Evra case. Liverpool drew widespread criticism at the time for allowing Su\u00e1rez and his teammates to wear T-shirts supporting him during warm-ups for a game while he appealed that suspension.         \n\nThe new incident has put Liverpool in a difficult position. The club signed Su\u00e1rez to a new four-year contract last summer and has shown little inclination to part with him, certainly not for less than the $35 million it paid Ajax to acquire him a little more than two years ago. A player of Su\u00e1rez\u2019s age (26) and output ( \n) might command a transfer fee of  \n. But the question of whether the remaining six games of his league suspension would carry over in a new country \u2014 Joey Barton\u2019s 12-match F.A. ban did when he was loaned to Marseille in the French league this season \u2014 as well as Su\u00e1rez\u2019s reputation as a  \n, a  \n and worse would certainly reduce his value on the transfer market. If, that is, Liverpool even wants to sell him. After Sunday\u2019s incident, Liverpool officials said they had no intention of doing that.         \n\nThe Reds have some time to decide, starting with the final four games of this season. But Liverpool\u2019s embarrassment may not be complete. Su\u00e1rez is a finalist, with Tottenham\u2019s Gareth Bale and Manchester United\u2019s Robin Van Persie and others, for the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association player of the year award. Nominations were made earlier this year, when Su\u00e1rez was leading the Premier League in scoring. The winner will be announced Sunday.
