{"headline": "Bound Together by Blood and Wine", "body": "\nOnce, when I was 15, I passed my grandfather on Queens Boulevard and pretended not to know him. He was over six feet tall, wearing his giant leather boots and weighed down with bags of cured meats, fresh loaves of bread, probably anchovies and what I considered exotic produce at the time (escarole, artichokes and Swiss chard), food of his native Piedmont, Italy. I was with a friend and embarrassed by his Old World ways.         \n\nAs a lot of second-generation immigrants did then, my father embraced being American and taught us to shun our heritage. Our family was not the demonstrative Italian stereotype in movies. \u201cIt\u2019s all in the mind\u201d was my father\u2019s mantra (like when we were cold and wanted a sweater). He idolized John Wayne. The man once had a quadruple bypass and didn\u2019t tell his kids. He still doesn\u2019t wear a winter coat. He never spoke Italian, except to his parents. He was dragged as child to Italy and visited twice in the Navy. He never went back.         \n\nBut I was curious and visited Italy after college, taking a trip to visit my grandfather\u2019s family in Asti. My grandfather died a few years earlier, and I took solace in the resemblance of his younger brother, Mario. I took a photo of Mario, his belt tied sloppily over his protruding belly, standing sentinel over his land. His grandson, Sergio, about 9, was doing wheelies on his bike.         \n\nMore than 20 years later, the boy doing wheelies grew up to be a racecar driver, and he and I connected on Facebook. Sergio told me he was going to focus his time on the family wine business. Would I be interested in helping him export? My relationship with wine was simply that I loved to drink the stuff. I said yes.         \n\nWe met for the first time as adults at a hotel lobby in Milan two years ago. Leaning on a column with spiky hair and a turned-up collar, he looked like Mickey Rourke before the plastic surgery. As he came toward me, I saw he walked with a severe limp. One side of his hip dipped toward the floor, one leg dragging behind him. It seemed rude to ask about it, so I didn\u2019t.         \n\nAs he drove the winding roads to Asti, we talked wine. \u201cIt\u2019s all in the \u2018noise,\u2019 \u201d he said. He meant to say \u201cnose.\u201d Suspicious of so-called wine experts, I thought \u201cnoise\u201d more appropriate.         \n\n\u201cA lot of wine is about becoming aware \u2014 smells, taste, looking, texture,\u201d Sergio explained. \u201cIt\u2019s simple, really.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t really simple. Exporting wine to the United States is full of challenges \u2014 from archaic laws that can hinder growth to hordes of competitors. More than a dozen steel tanks wait on the side of Sergio\u2019s house, for the moment when demand goes up.         \n\nAfter spraying the vines with fertilizer, using a tank on her back, Sergio\u2019s mother, along with his grandmother, served endless local fare: anchovies and tomatoes; prosciutto with melon; gnocchi with pesto; risotto with mushrooms and veal Milanese. Foods I once rejected, I now love.         \n\nA few days after my arrival in Asti, we drove through waves of vineyards in the countryside. Sergio turned up Mick Jagger singing \u201cYou Can\u2019t Always Get What You Want\u201d and lighted a cigarette before sticking it out the window. We passed sienna-hued homes on hilltops with orange roofs, ancient and elegant and Italian.         \n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine suffering in this landscape. A vineyard plague in the years leading up to World War I caused many families to go hungry. It was then that my grandfather left for Hell\u2019s Kitchen. Decades of hardship seemed to have taught the generations not to dwell on it. You just get through it.         \n\nOne day, I finally asked Sergio about his limp: \u201cDid you get hurt in a racing accident?\u201d         \n\n\u201cNo, driving home. In 1996. A crash. Doctors said I would never walk again. I was three years in a wheelchair.\u201d         \n\n\u201cThat must have been hard.\u201d         \n\n\u201cJust boring. I needed  \n\u201d (willpower). His version of John Wayne.         \n\n\u201cIs it because of the accident you decided to go into the wine business?\u201d         \n\n\u201cNo, I raced after the accident . . . maybe to show I could.\u201d         \n\nLater, I saw the trophy from that race in the parlor among wine bottles. And an e-mail from my father, with a photo of him and my grandfather plowing the fields with a pair of oxen during a summer visit in 1948. He had written in Italian:  \n. (Things have gotten easier.)  \n!\u201d        ", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/03/magazine/bound-together-by-blood-and-wine.html", "date": "2013-03-01", "description": "My father couldn\u2019t get far enough away from Italy, but the family business drew me back in."}
