{"headline": "Imagining a Swap Meet for E-Books and Music", "body": "\nThe paperback of \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d is exactly like the digital version except for this: If you hate the paperback, you can give it away or resell it. If you hate the e-book, you\u2019re stuck with it.         \n\nThe retailer\u2019s button might say \u201cbuy now,\u201d but you are in effect only renting an e-book \u2014 or an iTunes song \u2014 and your rights are severely limited. That has been the bedrock distinction between physical and electronic works since digital goods became widely available a decade ago.         \n\nThat distinction is now under attack, both in the courts and the marketplace, and it could shake up the already beleaguered book and music industries.  \n and  \n, the two biggest forces in electronic goods, are once again at the center of the turmoil.         \n\nIn late January, Amazon received  \n to set up an exchange for all sorts of digital material. The retailer would presumably earn a commission on each transaction, and consumers would surely see lower prices.         \n\nBut a shudder went through publishers and media companies. Those who produce content might see their work devalued, just as they did  \n. The price on the Internet for many used books these days is a penny.         \n\nOn Thursday, the United States Patent and Trademark Office published Apple\u2019s application for  \n for a digital marketplace. Apple\u2019s application outlines a system for allowing users to sell or give e-books, music, movies and software to each other by transferring files rather than reproducing them. Such a system would permit only one user to have a copy at any one time.         \n\nMeanwhile, a New York court is poised to rule on whether a start-up that created a way for people to buy and sell iTunes songs is breaking copyright law. A victory for the company would mean that consumers would not need either Apple\u2019s or Amazon\u2019s exchange to resell their digital items. Electronic bazaars would spring up instantly.         \n\n\u201cThe technology to allow the resale of digital goods is now in place, and it will cause a dramatic upheaval,\u201d said Bill Rosenblatt, president of GiantSteps, a technology consulting firm. \u201cIn the short term, it\u2019s great for consumers. Over the long term, however, it could seriously reduce creators\u2019 incentive to create.\u201d         \n\nScott Turow, the best-selling novelist and president of the Authors Guild, sees immediate peril in the prospect of a secondhand digital thrift shop. \u201cThe resale of e-books would send the price of new books crashing,\u201d he said. \u201cWho would want to be the sucker who buys the book at full price when a week later everyone else can buy it for a penny?\u201d         \n\nHe acknowledged it would be good for consumers \u2014 \u201cuntil there were no more authors anymore.\u201d         \n\nLibraries, though, welcome the possibility of loosened restrictions on digital material.         \n\n\u201cThe vast majority of e-books are not available in your public library,\u201d said Brandon Butler, director of public policy initiatives for the Association of Research Libraries. \u201cThat\u2019s pathetic.\u201d         \n\nHe said that 60 percent of what the association\u2019s 125 members buy was electronic, which meant sharp restrictions on use. Libraries cannot buy from Apple\u2019s iTunes, he said. And so, for example, Pixar\u2019s Oscar-winning soundtrack for the movie \u201cUp\u201d is not available in any public collection. An Apple spokesman confirmed this.         \n\n\u201cIf these things can\u2019t be owned, who is going to make sure they exist going forward?\u201d Mr. Butler asked. \u201cWithout substantial changes, we can\u2019t do what libraries have always done, which is lend and preserve.\u201d         \n\nFor over a century, the ability of consumers, secondhand bookstores and libraries to do whatever they wanted with a physical book has been enshrined in law. The crucial 1908 case involved a publisher that issued a novel with a warning that no one was allowed to sell it for less than $1. When Macy\u2019s offered the book for 89 cents, the publisher sued.         \n\nThat led to a landmark Supreme Court ruling limiting the copyright owner\u2019s control to the first sale. After that, it was a free market.         \n\nSales of digital material are considered licenses, which give consumers little or no ability to lend the item. The worry is that without such constraints digital goods could be infinitely reproduced while still in the possession of the original owner.         \n\nBoth the Amazon and Apple systems aim to solve this problem. Amazon\u2019s patent envisions a book or movie or song being kept in a customer\u2019s personalized \u201cdata store.\u201d When an item is no longer wanted, the user could sell or trade it to another user, an action that would automatically delete the item from the first user\u2019s store.
