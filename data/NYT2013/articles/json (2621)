{"headline": "Two (Sucked) Thumbs Up", "body": "\nA year ago, on the day my wife, Liz, would give birth to our first child, we sat down to watch \u201cThe Avengers.\u201d She\u2019d already seen it, and it wasn\u2019t something I was particularly dying to see \u2014 superhero movies aren\u2019t usually my thing. My cinematic taste generally tends to the somewhat obscure and the challenging \u2014 I\u2019d much rather rewatch anything by Rainer Werner Fassbinder than sit through any of the \u201cFast and Furious\u201d sequels. But Liz had started to feel the fluttering of early labor, and our birth-class instructor had advised us that this particular stage could last for several hours. The best thing to do, she said, was find a distraction: go for a walk, play cards or watch a dumb movie. As it turned out, there wasn\u2019t going to be a need for any distractions. Within minutes, that fluttering became what Liz described, with some understatement, as cramps. What followed was such an incredibly compressed labor that there\u2019s actually a special name for it: precipitous labor, which happens less than 3 percent of the time. Our son, Jack, was born an hour and a half later, at home, in our bed. I still haven\u2019t seen \u201cThe Avengers.\u201d         \n\nBefore Jack arrived, it wasn\u2019t that unusual for me to see five movies in a day, most, if not all, of them in a movie theater. For much of my 20s and early 30s (I\u2019m now 44), as I tried to get a filmmaking career off the ground, I simultaneously spent nearly all of my time watching and writing and thinking about movies. I haunted the Cinematheque in Toronto, where they show all the art-house and experimental stuff, and even literally wept with joy one night while sitting behind Liv Ullmann at a screening of Charlie Chaplin\u2019s \u201cLimelight.\u201d Every fall, the Toronto International Film Festival took over both the city and my life \u2014 it was like Christmas, Mardi Gras and a self-imposed experiment in sleep deprivation all rolled into one \u2014 and I plotted my film-going days, typically 17 hours long, on spreadsheets and color-coded graph paper. I was, for a couple of those years, the managing editor of a defiantly obscurantist movie magazine whose newsstand-unfriendly covers routinely featured filmmakers famous only in certain precincts of Busan, Korea. A framed original one-sheet of Jean-Luc Godard\u2019s \u201cJLG/JLG\u201d \u2014 in French, almost five feet tall \u2014 still hangs in our living room.         \n\nAnd when I used to hear parents complain that they didn\u2019t have even a few minutes to scan the newspaper, let alone finish a novel or catch all that year\u2019s Oscar nominees, I inwardly scoffed (sometimes outwardly). Clearly, they just didn\u2019t care that much about Syria or Hilary Mantel or Quentin Tarantino. I mean, really, an average newborn sleeps like 16 hours a day; you can\u2019t squeeze in a Lydia Davis short story or a half-hour of \u201cGirls\u201d? Trying to talk to new moms and dads about culture felt to me like trying to talk to prison inmates about their favorite brunch spots.         \n\nForgive me, fellow parents. I am now in that prison.         \n\nI now understand that, yes, a baby seems to sleep a lot, but that you\u2019re watching them for many of those hours to make sure they\u2019re still alive. (Newborn breathing, in my experience, can sound uncomfortably like a death rattle.) I\u2019ve learned that, especially in those early months, time means nothing. Days dwindle to fleeting dots, but individual moments \u2014 like getting a sobbing kid into a car seat \u2014 can feel endless. And I\u2019ve learned that, in the foggy, confusing, often frightening slipstream of a baby\u2019s arrival, the things that vanish, no matter how much you love and think you need them, are the things that are not all that useful or necessary \u2014 even if they once seemed essential to your sense of self. Inessential things like antiquing or golf or, yes, going to the movies. I instantly became one of those fathers I mocked. If you asked me last fall who Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis was, I couldn\u2019t have told you.         \n\n \n months after our son was born, Liz and I had our first date night. We went to see the Paul Thomas Anderson film \u201cThe Master.\u201d Not the most romantic, or even relaxing, choice, certainly. But the film geek in me wanted to see it on a big screen, in 70 mm, before it left theaters. Liz gamely went along, happy to see anything that wasn\u2019t the four walls of a nursery.
