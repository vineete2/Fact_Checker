It set off alarms. The address, linked to senior Qaeda operatives, had been dormant for months.         \n\nInvestigators worked their way backward and traced the e-mail to an address in Aurora, Colo., outside Denver. It took them to  \n, a 24-year-old former coffee cart operator, who was asking a Qaeda facilitator about how to mix ingredients for a flour-based explosive, according to law enforcement officials. A later e-mail read: \u201cThe marriage is ready\u201d \u2014 code that a major attack was planned.         \n\nWhat followed in the next few days was a cross-country pursuit in which the police stopped Mr. Zazi on the George Washington Bridge, let him go, and after several false starts, arrested him in New York.  \n to plotting to carry out backpack bombings in the city\u2019s subway system.         \n\nIt is that kind of success that  \n in California when he defended the  \n\u2019s  \n from Microsoft, Google, Yahoo and other companies.         \n\nHe argued that \u201cmodest encroachments on privacy\u201d \u2014 including keeping records of phone numbers called and the length of calls that can be used to track terrorists, though not listening in to calls \u2014 were \u201cworth us doing\u201d to protect the country. The programs, he said, were authorized by Congress and regularly reviewed by federal courts.         \n\nBut privacy advocates questioned the portrayal of the program\u2019s intrusion on Americans\u2019 communications as modest. When Americans communicate with a targeted person overseas, the program can vacuum up and store for later searching \u2014 without a warrant \u2014 their calls and e-mails, too.         \n\nMr. Obama acknowledged that he had hesitations when he inherited the program from George W. Bush, but told reporters that he soon became convinced of its necessity. \u201cYou can\u2019t have 100 percent security and also then have 100 percent privacy and zero inconvenience,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to make some choices as a society.\u201d         \n\nTo defenders of the N.S.A., the Zazi case underscores how the agency\u2019s Internet surveillance system, called Prism, which was set up over the past decade to collect data from online providers of e-mail and chat services, has yielded concrete results.         \n\n\u201cWe were able to glean critical information,\u201d said a senior intelligence official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cIt was through an e-mail correspondence that we had access to only through Prism.\u201d         \n\nJohn Miller, a former senior intelligence official who now works for CBS News, said on \u201cCBS This Morning,\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s how a program like this is supposed to work.\u201d         \n\nVeterans of the Obama intelligence agencies say the large collections of digital data are vital in the search for terrorists. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for a needle in the haystack, you need a haystack,\u201d Jeremy Bash, chief of staff to Leon E. Panetta, the former C.I.A. director and defense secretary, said on MSNBC on Friday.         \n\nUnder the program, intelligence officials must present Internet companies with specific requests for information on a case-by-case basis, showing that the target is a foreigner and located outside the United States, a senior law enforcement official said Friday. If the N.S.A. comes across information about an American citizen during the search, it turns over that material to the F.B.I. for an assessment, the official said.         \n\nAn administration official said Friday that agencies were evaluating whether they could publicly identify particular terrorism cases that came to the government\u2019s attention through the telephone or Internet programs.         \n\nRepresentative Mike Rogers, the Michigan Republican who is chairman of the House intelligence committee, said Thursday that the phone program \u201cwas used to stop a terrorist attack.\u201d He did not identify the plot, or explain whether the call logs in the case would have been unavailable by ordinary subpoenas.         \n\nTwo Democratic senators on the Intelligence Committee  \n under the  \n, Ron Wyden of Oregon and Mark Udall of Colorado, said Friday that their study of the calling log program has convinced them that it was not worth its cost to privacy.         \n\n\u201cAs far as we can see, all of the useful information that it has provided appears to have also been available through other collection methods that do not violate the privacy of law-abiding Americans,\u201d they said.
