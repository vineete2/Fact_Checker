{"headline": "Addressing Teenage Drinking", "body": "\nThe topic this week for our third New Parent-Old Parent column is teenage drinking, which I found to be one of the very hardest parenting problems I faced. To be perfectly honest, I never felt I got it right. Several years back, when my twins were 17 and their older brother was 19, I described my frustrations in a  \n:         \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s O.K. All of it is illegal; they\u2019re not 21. Is any drinking all right if they\u2019re breaking the law? If, on the other hand, teenagers will be teenagers and some drinking is fine and normal, how much is? How often? It\u2019s not O.K. if they get sick, as all have done at least once and been grounded. Is it O.K. if they come home and I can\u2019t tell from 10 feet away?\u201d         \n\nIn some ways, what it all boiled down to was this: How do you teach a teenager moderation?         \n\nAfter that column appeared, several readers wrote to tell me that I had it all wrong, that parents have to put down their foot, that you just don\u2019t let them drink at all until they\u2019re 21, period. I was accused of being one of those spineless modern-day parents.         \n\nBut when I called those people who were so sure of themselves, eager to know how they had managed to stop all drinking, invariably I would hear the same thing:         \n\nMy kids are only 6 and 10, but believe me, that\u2019s how I\u2019m going to handle it when they\u2019re teenagers.         \n\nRight. Spoken like a parent who\u2019s never had a teenager. And doesn\u2019t remember being a teenager.         \n\nSo \u2014 Motherlode parents, do you have questions that relate to drinking and your teenagers?         \n\nBoomer parents:  \nAre there things you did that worked \u2014 or just as important, did not work?         \n\nAnd a question for Old Parents and New Parents alike: How did your parents handle teenage drinking, and was it effective?         \n\n \n and I\u2019ll round up some of the most interesting answers and post them on  \n next Friday. Then it will be the New Parents\u2019 turn to choose a topic.
