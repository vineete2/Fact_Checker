{"headline": "Citrus Disease With No Cure Is Ravaging Florida Groves", "body": "\nAVON PARK, Fla. \u2014 Florida\u2019s citrus industry is grappling with the most serious threat in its history: a bacterial disease with no cure that has infected all 32 of the state\u2019s citrus-growing counties.         \n\nAlthough the disease,  \n, was first spotted in Florida in 2005, this year\u2019s losses from it are by far the most extensive. While the bacteria, which causes fruit to turn bitter and drop from the trees when still unripe, affects all citrus fruits, it has been most devastating to oranges, the largest crop. So many have been affected that the United States Department of Agriculture has downgraded its crop estimates five months in a row, an extraordinary move, analysts said.         \n\nWith the harvest not yet over, orange production has already decreased 10 percent from the initial estimate, a major swing, they said.         \n\n\u201cThe long and short of it is that the industry that made Florida, that is synonymous with Florida, that is a staple on every American breakfast table, is totally threatened,\u201d said Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat who helped obtain $11 million in federal money for research to fight the disease. \u201cIf we don\u2019t find a cure, it will eliminate the citrus industry.\u201d         \n\nThe relentless migration of the disease from southern to northern Florida \u2014 and beyond \u2014 has deepened concerns this year among orange juice processors, investors, growers and lawmakers. Florida is the second-largest producer of orange juice in the world, behind Brazil, and the state\u2019s $9 billion citrus industry is a major economic force, contributing 76,000 jobs.         \n\nThe industry, lashed over the years by canker disease, hard freezes and multiple hurricanes, is no stranger to hardship. But citrus greening is by far the most worrisome.         \n\nThe disease, which can lie dormant for two to five years, is spread by an insect no larger than the head of a pin, the  \n. It snacks on citrus trees, depositing bacteria that gradually starves trees of nutrients. Psyllids fly from tree to tree, leaving a trail of infection.         \n\nConcerted efforts by growers and millions of dollars spent on research to fight the disease have so far failed, growers and scientists said. The situation was worsened this season by an unusual weather pattern, including a dry winter, growers said.         \n\n\u201cWe have got a real big problem,\u201d said Vic Story, a lifelong citrus grower and the head of  \n, which owns 2,000 acres of groves in Central Florida and manages an additional 3,000 acres, all of which are affected at varying levels. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely the biggest threat in my lifetime, and I\u2019m 68. This is a tree killer.\u201d         \n\nBefore this year, the losses and increased costs of fighting the disease had already taken a toll on Florida\u2019s citrus industry, which has been in decline for 15 years. In a 2012 report, University of Florida agricultural analysts concluded that between 2006 and 2012, citrus greening cost Florida\u2019s economy $4.5 billion and 8,000 jobs.         \n\nSome orange packers and small and midsize growers have sold their groves, razed them for development, or simply abandoned them. Others have postponed replanting lost trees, which take five years to mature, until they know whether a cure will be found. Many more, including the largest growers, are doing what they can to survive; they say they are optimistic they can hold on long enough for researchers to find a treatment.         \n\n\u201cThis year was a real kick in the gut,\u201d said Adam Putnam, Florida\u2019s agriculture commissioner and a former United States representative, whose family owns citrus groves. \u201cIt is now everywhere, and it\u2019s just as bad as the doomsayers said it would be.\u201d         \n\nBut there was good news this week, too. Coca-Cola announced it would spend $2 billion to plant 25,000 acres of new orange groves. The company, which owns Minute Maid and the Simply juice brands, will buy fruit from two growers in Florida \u2014 one local and the other a Brazilian company that has invested in the state.         \n\n\u201cTo see such a dominant player in the beverage market double down on the future of orange juice in Florida is a real morale boost to the industry and a sign they have confidence we will find a cure for greening,\u201d Mr. Putnam said.
