{"headline": "Contractors Describe Limited Testing of Insurance Web Site", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Federal officials did not fully test the online health insurance marketplace until two weeks before it opened to the public on Oct. 1, contractors told Congress on Thursday.         \n\nWhile individual components of the system were tested earlier, they said, the government did not conduct \u201cend-to-end-testing\u201d of the system until late September.         \n\nThe disclosure came at a hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which is investigating problems plaguing the federal marketplace, or exchange, a central pillar of President Obama\u2019s health care overhaul. The hearing suggested that the team of contractors was more like an orchestra with scores of musicians playing different tunes and no conductor to lead the overall effort, set the tempo or unify the ensemble.         \n\nLawmakers from both parties expressed anger and dismay at the contractors\u2019 performance. The lawmakers said they felt misled because the same contractors testified at a hearing on Sept. 10 that the online marketplace was working properly and was ready to enroll millions of Americans eager to buy insurance, subsidized by the government.         \n\nThe Obama administration was supposed to coordinate the work of the contractors on the federal insurance exchange. But witnesses had difficulty delineating their roles and responsibilities on the project, and they said the government was responsible for all the major decisions.         \n\n\u201cThere is a major league blame game going on,\u201d said Representative Pete Olson, Republican of Texas.         \n\nRepresentative David B. McKinley, Republican of West Virginia, told the witnesses: \u201cI haven\u2019t heard one of you apologize to the American public on behalf of your company for the problems. Are apologies not in order? I haven\u2019t heard the words \u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019\u00a0\u201d         \n\nExecutives from two contractors \u2014  \n, a unit of the CGI Group, and the  \n \u2014 said the federal  \n decided to open the exchange on Oct. 1 even though testing had raised concerns.         \n\nAfter the hearing, Julie Bataille, a spokeswoman for the Medicare agency, said, \u201cDue to a compressed time frame, the system was not tested enough.\u201d She did not answer questions about whether the administration had considered delaying the debut of the online marketplace.         \n\nPolitics pervaded the session. Republicans said that technical problems crippling the federal Web site epitomized fundamental flaws in the 2010 health care law, Mr. Obama\u2019s most significant legislative achievement.         \n\nDemocrats said that the law was fundamentally sound, and that the Web site needed to be fixed immediately so people could get the insurance they had been promised.         \n\n\u201cFix it, don\u2019t nix it,\u201d Democrats said.         \n\nRepresentative Diana DeGette, Democrat of Colorado, said: \u201cThree weeks after the Web site went live, we are still hearing reports of significant problems. These problems need to be fixed, and they need to be fixed fast.\u201d         \n\nCheryl R. Campbell, a senior vice president of CGI Federal, the main contractor on the federal exchange, said that end-to-end testing of the full integrated system first occurred \u201cin the last two weeks of September.\u201d         \n\nAnother witness, Andrew M. Slavitt of UnitedHealth, said, \u201cWe didn\u2019t see full end-to-end testing until a couple of days leading up to the launch\u201d of the federal marketplace on Oct. 1.         \n\nThe UnitedHealth Group owns one of the nation\u2019s largest insurance companies and also owns Quality Software Services Inc., which supervised \u201cidentity management,\u201d including the use of password-protected accounts, in the federal marketplace.         \n\nMs. Campbell and Mr. Slavitt said they would have preferred months of testing, in keeping with industry standards for a project of such immense complexity. The federal exchange must communicate with other contractors and with databases of numerous federal agencies and more than 170 insurance carriers.         \n\nThe vision of affordable insurance for all Americans has been tarnished by technical problems that have made it difficult for consumers to shop in the federal marketplace serving 36 states.
