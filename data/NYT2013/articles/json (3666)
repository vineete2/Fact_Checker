{"headline": "Threat to Block Debate on Guns Appears to Fade in Senate", "body": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Several Senate Republicans said Tuesday that they would not participate in a  \n of the first major gun control bill since 1993, as Democrats appeared on the verge of overcoming a blockade threatened by a group of conservatives before a word of debate on the measure was uttered.         \n\nSenator  \n of Nevada, the majority leader, said he would schedule an initial showdown vote for Thursday. If backers of the measure can corral at least 60 votes, the Senate will begin consideration of a series of gun safety proposals \u2014 strongly supported by President Obama \u2014 that would still face a long and difficult journey across the Senate floor.         \n\nThe bill, which would increase penalties for illegal gun purchase and greatly expand background checks on gun buyers, would again need 60 votes to end the ensuing debate after consideration of contentious amendments, including a renewal of the assault weapons ban. Should it cross that very high hurdle, 51 votes would be needed to get to final passage. Even with Democrats controlling 55 seats, no majority was assured given the resistance of some Democrats from more conservative states who face re-election campaigns next year.         \n\nEven as Mr. Reid scheduled a vote, Senators  \n, Democrat of West Virginia, and  \n, Republican of Pennsylvania were very near a deal that would most likely serve as an amendment replacing the background check piece of the measure that Mr. Reid is seeking a vote on. Their measure, which would almost certainly appeal to a broader base of members than the one now at the heart of the debate, would include fewer gun buyers in newly expanded checks, but allow for the record keeping that many Republicans have opposed. The two were expected to announce a deal Wednesday. Mr. Manchin briefed Mr. Reid late Tuesday.         \n\nStill, eking out the first 60 votes would represent momentum for the bill\u2019s supporters in the Senate, and an egg-on-the-face moment for those Republican senators, led by some younger conservatives, who chose to highlight their efforts to kill the bill before debate, a procedural move usually done more stealthily.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re moving forward on this bill,\u201d said Mr. Reid, who earlier Tuesday invoked his own father\u2019s suicide by gunshot to implore consideration of the legislation. \u201cThe American people deserve a vote on this legislation.\u201d         \n\nSenate Republicans began splintering Tuesday on whether the bill should be allowed full consideration on the floor, with nearly a dozen, including Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Susan Collins of Maine, Johnny Isakson of Georgia and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, saying they would support a procedural motion to take up the legislation formally for debate and amendments.         \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not very much ambivalence on Capitol Hill about the gun issue,\u201d Mr. Isakson said. \u201cYou\u2019re on one side or the other, so there\u2019s no reason not to go ahead and vote.\u201d         \n\nThe dynamic potentially sets scores of Democrats who staunchly support new gun control measures against moderates from their own party. Many of those members are up for re-election next year and would rather not see the bill move forward.         \n\nMr. Reid\u2019s decision to forge ahead came as lobbying on gun control stepped up on Capitol Hill, with the families of those killed in Newtown, Conn., four months ago fanning out across the Senate to appeal to lawmakers to vote for legislation to expand background checks for gun buyers and limit the size of magazines.         \n\n\u201cI think we bring a face to this tragedy,\u201d said Mark Barden, whose son Daniel was among the 20  \n. The parents were reluctant to discuss whom they had met with, though according to several Senate Democrats, it was largely members from their party.         \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re encouraged and arranged meetings, whenever possible, with Republicans and Democrats,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut. \u201cSome of my colleagues were more welcoming than others.\u201d         \n\nThe decision by some Senate Republicans to abandon the filibuster on what is formally known as a motion to proceed came less than 24 hours after Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, announced his support for the filibuster, resulting in a rare show of disunity among Senate Republicans.         \n\nThirteen senators, led by a core of younger conservatives, had vowed to try to block any legislation that they saw as infringing on the constitutional right to bear arms.
