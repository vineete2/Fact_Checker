<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Rudolph</ENAMEX>, the developer of the giant Saturn 5 rocket that
launched a crew of American astronauts on the first manned flight
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">moon</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1969</TIMEX>, died <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> after he lapsed into a coma at his
home in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hamburg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>. He was 89.
<p>
   He left the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX> and moved back to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>
after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> accused him of ``working thousands of
slave laborers to death'' while director of the German factory that
produced the V-2 rocket in World War II. He denied the accusation.
<p>
   His death was reported in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Huntsville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ala.</ENAMEX>, by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugh McInnish</ENAMEX>, a
friend and retired military specialist who said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudolph</ENAMEX> died in an
ambulance on the way to a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hamburg</ENAMEX> hospital.
<p>
   He was one of 118 Nazi rocket engineers secretly brought to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> after the war. The scientists included <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wernher von
Braun</ENAMEX>, the father of the American rocket programs.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudolph</ENAMEX> was a key figure in the Apollo Project at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marshall
Space Flight Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Huntsville</ENAMEX>, one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s principal
installations. A member of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">von Braun</ENAMEX>'s team, he was the project
manager for the Saturn, a vital and complex component of Apollo.
<p>
   As project manager, the sheer size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">moon</ENAMEX> rocket was the
source of his nightmares during its development and construction.
``It was all harder than I ever expected,'' he told an interviewer
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1969</TIMEX>. ``Since it is so large and has so many components, you get
more people involved, and that makes it difficult. You have to get
them all to sing from the same sheet of music. My task has been as
choir director.''
<p>
   Besides a few top colleagues from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>, the project involved
some 100,000 people and several thousand industrial contractors who
designed, built and tested rocket parts and the Saturn 5 itself.
The cost was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$15 billion</NUMEX> by then for the 15 rockets on order.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Huntsville</ENAMEX> Saturn team got the green light in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1962</TIMEX> and
found that putting the enormous machine together proved one of the
toughest engineering and manufacturing feats ever.
<p>
   ``You want a valve that doesn't leak and you try everything
possible to develop one,'' he said. ``But the real world provides
you with a leaky valve. You have to determine how much leaking you
can tolerate.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudolph</ENAMEX>'s association with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">von Braun</ENAMEX> started in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Peenemuende</ENAMEX>,
where scientists made the V-1 and V-2 rockets for the German war
machine.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Von Braun</ENAMEX> also was a target of accusations about his past but
countered that he was a scientist dedicated to rockets and space
flight and nothing else.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudolph</ENAMEX> first joined forces with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">von Braun</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1934</TIMEX> and
remembered igniting his early rockets with lighted cigarettes.
<p>
   At the time of his entry into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudolph</ENAMEX> was
described by the American military government in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX> as an
``ardent Nazi'' but he was not classified as a war criminal. But
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> documents from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years later</TIMEX> showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudolph</ENAMEX> had indeed
been classified as a war criminal by West German and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
officials.
<p>
   These documents surfaced when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Special
Investigations</ENAMEX> was formed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> to investigate
war crimes. The office conducted an investigation and interviewed
survivors of forced labor at the V-2 factory.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred Sher</ENAMEX>, the director of special investigations, said this
evidence was presented to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudolph</ENAMEX> and he signed a document agreeing
to relinquish his <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> citizenship. In return the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice
Department</ENAMEX> agreed not to pursue his case in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> handed the information over to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West
Germany</ENAMEX>, but in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bonn</ENAMEX> government ruled that there was
insufficient evidence to justify trying <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudolph</ENAMEX>. Feeling himself
vindicated, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudolph</ENAMEX> began trying to regain his American citizenship
and return to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Some present and former employees at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marshall Space Flight
Center</ENAMEX> and elsewhere at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> supported him, saying <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudolph</ENAMEX>'s
contribution to the American space program never received the
proper credit.
<p>
   He is survived by his wife, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martha</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hamburg</ENAMEX>; and a daughter,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marianne Rudolph</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Jose</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">HOUSTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> began recalling several hundred furloughed
federal employees back to their posts at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION|LOCATION">Johnson Space Center</ENAMEX>
without pay on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>, so the agency can proceed with plans to
launch the shuttle Endeavour on a mission to retrieve a Japanese
science satellite <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Shuttle managers planned to convene <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION|LOCATION">Kennedy
Space Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> to assess preparations to launch Endeavour
and an international crew of six on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan. 11</TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``Right now, shuttle program managers are in the process of
exempting additional employees who are necessary for the
preparation and conduct of the mission,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff Carr</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ENAMEX>'s chief spokesman at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The precise number of employees being recalled was unavailable.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carr</ENAMEX> said the agency was following a plan similar to one
imposed during a five-day furlough in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX> that coincided with
a shuttle mission to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russia</ENAMEX>'s Mir space station.
<p>
   About 900 of the nearly 3,500 federal workers at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson</ENAMEX>
continued to work in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>.
<p>
   When the most recent furlough began <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Dec. 15</TIMEX>, the space agency
fully exempted about 50 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson</ENAMEX> workers, primarily for management
and security. Another 1,200 were exempted to work on an
``as-needed'' basis to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> shuttle flight and space
station development plans on schedule.
<p>
   The space agency has successfully demonstrated to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>
administration that long delays in either program could cost more
to recover from than to continue.
<p>
   Among the issues that shuttle managers will likely assess
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> is the status of funding for the large contractor work
force required to launch and fly Endeavour.
<p>
   A spokeswoman for the 4,000 workers employed under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell
Space Operations Co.</ENAMEX> shuttle contract in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>
that the contractor has not furloughed any workers and forecasts
adequate funding through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX>.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">CAPE CANAVERAL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Working in chilly temperatures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> ground crews readied the space shuttle Endeavour for
launch on a Japanese satellite retrieval mission.
<p>
   Endeavour, with an international crew of six, was set to blast
off from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION|LOCATION">Kennedy Space Center</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4:18 a.m. EST</TIMEX>, the
start of a 49-minute launching period. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine-day</TIMEX> shuttle flight
was to be the 12th launched in darkness.
<p>
   Forecasters offered a favorable weather outlook, as dozens of
technicians and engineers undertook the most hazardous portion of
the long countdown  &MD;  the pumping of explosive, supercold hydrogen
and oxygen propellants into Endeavour's 15-story fuel tank.
<p>
   The lone concern among mission managers was that temperatures in
the mid-40s, high humidity and light winds might permit the
unwanted formation of ice on the outside of the tank, in which a
half-million gallons of fuel are stored, much of it at temperatures
of 400 degrees below zero.
<p>
   ``If the winds abate somewhat, there is a concern that ice will
accrete on the tank, at least that it will at least be potentially
an issue,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed Priselac</ENAMEX>, shuttle weather officer for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ENAMEX>. Should the ice shake
loose on launch, it could damage the orbiter.
<p>
   Once aloft, Endeavour commander <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Duffy</ENAMEX>, pilot <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brent Jett</ENAMEX>,
flight engineer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winston Scott</ENAMEX> and mission specialists <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leroy Chiao</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Barry</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koichi Wakata</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> will pursue the orbiting Space
Flyer Unit, an experiment-laden satellite launched by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 18</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The shuttle crew plans to snare the spacecraft with the
shuttle's robot arm <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early Saturday</TIMEX> as the two spacecraft circle the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> at an altitude of just under 300 miles.
<p>
   Once berthed in Endeavour's cargo bay, the fliers will turn
their attention to the mission's other objectives. These include
the deployment and retrieval of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>-owned spacecraft called
Spartan, which carries a half-dozen experiments.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiao</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry</ENAMEX> have prepared for a pair of near
seven-hour spacewalks in which they plan to test hand tools,
equipment and spacesuit garb that will be required for the assembly
and maintenance of the planned international space station.
<p>
   The astronauts also plan three dozen medical, biotechnology and
engineering experiments, including an evaluation of how well a
half-dozen nursing rats can feed 60 baby rodents in a
self-contained enclosure that is being prepared for future shuttle
and space station use.
<p>
   ``This is an ambitious mission,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bryan Austin</ENAMEX>, the
venture's lead flight director. ``For the most part, every day will
hold a little something different for us.''

SHUTTLE ENDEAVOUR TO RETRIEVE JAPANESE SATELLITE
(saw)

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">CAPE CANAVERAL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>  &MD;  The space shuttle Endeavour <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>
began an orbital chase of a large Japanese satellite that it is to
capture and bring back to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> as the highlight of an ambitious
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine-day</TIMEX> mission.
<p>
   Endeavour and its crew of six astronauts began the hunt before
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dawn</TIMEX> when the shuttle lifted off from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION|LOCATION">Kennedy Space Center</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4:41
a.m.</TIMEX> The launching was delayed for about <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</TIMEX> while
technicians sorted out ground communication problems.
<p>
   It was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years ago this month</TIMEX>, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan. 28, 1986</TIMEX>, in 36-degree
cold, that the space shuttle Challenger exploded after liftoff,
killing all seven crew members. It was later determined that seals
on the booster rockets had been affected by the cold. The
temperature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>, 44 degrees, was the coldest since that
launching.
<p>
   Endeavour is to close in on the Japanese satellite, a
7,000-pound, reusable experiment platform called the Space Flyer
Unit, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>. A Japanese astronaut on board the shuttle,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koichi Wakata</ENAMEX>, is to use Endeavour's 50-foot robot arm to snare the
satellite and secure it in the shuttle's cargo bay. The satellite,
launched <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last March</TIMEX> aboard a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese Space Agency</ENAMEX> H-2 rocket, was
designed to be retrieved by an American shuttle.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> will pay <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> about <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$50 million</NUMEX> for recovering the
satellite, which contains 11 scientific payloads, including
crystal-growth furnaces and an infrared telescope. Also on board,
in an experiment to see how weightlessness affects spawning, are
two red-bellied newts, now dead, and their fertilized eggs.
<p>
   Endeavour was launched during one of the coldest spells of
weather to hit <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="1989">since 1989</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Since last weekend</TIMEX>, ground crews
had used several heating systems to keep the orbiter and its
rockets warm.
<p>
   Launchings in cold weather concern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> officials because low
temperatures were a factor in the Challenger explosion.
Investigators found that the cold stiffened O-ring seals in the
booster rockets, allowing hot gases to escape and ignite the large
external fuel tank. As a result, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> adopted new weather rules for
launchings and added heaters to protect shuttle components.
<p>
   During the current mission, Endeavour's crew also is to release
and retrieve a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> satellite that will orbit more than 100 miles
from the shuttle for two days while doing experiments on
atmospheric contamination of spacecraft and using the Global
Positioning System to control orbital craft. That system, which
uses satellite information sent to special receivers to pinpoint
locations on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>, has never been used to determine the position
and velocity of craft in orbit.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">HOUSTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Astronauts aboard the space shuttle Endeavour were
forced to dodge a derelict <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> satellite <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>, as they sped
toward a rendezvous with the Japanese science spacecraft they plan
to retrieve and return to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   A small maneuver by shuttle commander <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Duffy</ENAMEX> and pilot
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brent Jett</ENAMEX> about two hours before the shuttle and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX>
satellite intersected allowed the two crafts to miss one another by
more than five miles. Without the maneuver, the two spacecraft
would have passed within eight-tenths of a mile of one another.
<p>
   ``It wasn't any big deal to us,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duffy</ENAMEX> who told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cable
News Network</ENAMEX> he and his colleagues were unable to see the 370-pound
satellite.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ENAMEX> identified the
interloper as a Miniature Sensor Technology Integration satellite
launched into a polar orbit in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1994</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX>. The
launch was for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ballistic Missile Defense Organization</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>'s successor to the Strategic Defense Initiative or ``Star
Wars'' program.
<p>
   Experimenters lost contact with the satellite in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1994</TIMEX>
after a series of successful experiments with its cameras and other
sensors for missile tracking.
<p>
   ``We track an awful lot of things in space,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff Bantle</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s mission operations directorate representative for the
shuttle flight.
<p>
   ``Occasionally, probably several times a flight, we are looking
very closely at a specific object, because it may be in
conjunction. Most of them track out of our concern.''
<p>
   According to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Research Council</ENAMEX> report compiled <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last
year</TIMEX>, more than 10,000 man-made objects larger than a softball and
tens of millions of smaller objects circle the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>, posing a
potential hazard to spacecraft. The largest objects are monitored
with radar and optical tracking devices by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.
Space Command</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Endeavour's astronauts are circling <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> at just under 300
miles, about 100 miles higher than on a typical mission, a factor
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>'s near encounter. At a lower altitude, larger objects are
more likely to be pulled into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>'s atmosphere and burn up,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bantle</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   Meanwhile, the shuttle crew closed rapidly on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s Space
Flyer Unit, the four-ton scientific satellite the astronauts plan
to retrieve <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early Saturday</TIMEX>. The astronauts were more than 13,000
miles from the spacecraft when they lifted off <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early Thursday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duffy</ENAMEX> was to maneuver Endeavour within 35 feet of the Space
Flyer Unit as the two spacecraft raced around <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> at nearly
18,000 miles per hour just before <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4:30 a.m. EST</TIMEX>, allowing Japanese
astronaut <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koichi Wakata</ENAMEX> to snare it with the shuttle's 50-foot-long
robot arm. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wakata</ENAMEX> was to berth the spacecraft in Endeavour's cargo
bay so it can be returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The Space Flyer Unit was developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s space community as
a reusable automated scientific satellite. It was launched from
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> for the first time on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 18</TIMEX> with nearly a dozen
experiments, including a small <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> astronomical observatory.

   Well, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clippers</ENAMEX> got the old ``A'' for effort, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockets</ENAMEX>
were not about to validate anything more, escaping with a 115-104
victory before 13,485 at the Sports Arena.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clippers</ENAMEX> (15-21) missed a chance to move out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific
Division</ENAMEX> cellar, but played one of their best halfs of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>
during a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">second-half</TIMEX> comeback that fell short.
<p>
   The main problem was a battle-tested <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX> team that never
blinked even while nearly blowing a 22-point lead. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hakeem Olajuwon</ENAMEX>
had 29 points and 17 rebounds, but converted only 8 of 24 shots.
<p>
   The real damage came from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clippers</ENAMEX> nemesis <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clyde Drexler</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The appearance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clippers</ENAMEX> was all <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drexler</ENAMEX> needed to return
to form for the first time since missing eight games with a bruised
thigh. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drexler</ENAMEX> made 5 of 6 of his 3-pointers and scored a game-high
32 points. He had made just 12 of 45 field goals entering the
contest, but usually plays his best against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clippers</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drexler</ENAMEX> scored 27 against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clippers</ENAMEX> when the teams met in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>. He averaged 32 points against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clippers</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last season</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drexler</ENAMEX>'s biggest 3-pointer came with <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two minutes left</TIMEX>, and gave
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX> a 99-93 advantage.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clippers</ENAMEX> made their comeback with the starters playing <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">all
12 minutes</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the third quarter</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Their first substitution did not come until <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pooh Richardson</ENAMEX>
suffered a strained right calf <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early in the fourth quarter</TIMEX>.
<p>
   But the first string was earning its minutes, cutting the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockets</ENAMEX>' lead to one-point (92-91) on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Williams</ENAMEX>' hook shot.
<p>
   But <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX> never panicked and simply rebuilt the lead by
forcing the ball into <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Olajuwon</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockets</ENAMEX> (25-11), showing no signs of fatigue after losing to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lakers</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>, were handling the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clippers</ENAMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">first half</TIMEX>
without a major contribution from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Olajuwon</ENAMEX>. The big center made
only two of his first 11 shots in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">half</TIMEX>, but then keyed a 14-0
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockets</ENAMEX> run by scoring eight points.
<p>
   The spurt gave <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX> a 54-32 lead and they eventually led by
20 points (58-38) at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">halftime</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malik Sealy</ENAMEX> started the game despite suffering a hyperextended
knee against <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minnesota</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> while diving for a loose ball
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doug West</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   He should be hurt more often. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sealy</ENAMEX> scored 27 points with eight
rebounds and four blocked shots before fouling out.
<p>
    &UR; Notes: &LR;  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rodney Rogers</ENAMEX> injured his right ankle on a drive in the
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">first quarter</TIMEX> and did not return. It is the same ankle he hurt <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last
month</TIMEX> that sidelined him for 15 games.... <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley Roberts</ENAMEX>, still
out with a sprained ankle but expected back before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the
current homestand</TIMEX>, did not show up for a second straight game. He
has been bothered by the flu.... <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pooh Richardson</ENAMEX> went 1 for 10 in
the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">first half</TIMEX>. He did not play the entire <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">fourth quarter</TIMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>'s victory over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minnesota</ENAMEX>. ``I can't get upset. I don't
make those decisions,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richardson</ENAMEX> said. ``I can't make those
decisions.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockets</ENAMEX> forward <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Horry</ENAMEX> did not dress, still
bothered by tendinitis in his right knee.

ASTRONAUTS EVALUATE TOOLS ON SPACEWALK
(For use by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times News Service</ENAMEX> clients.)

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">HOUSTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Endeavour astronauts <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leroy Chiao</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Barry</ENAMEX> walked
in space for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six hours</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, evaluating tools and procedures for
the assembly and maintenance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>-led international space
station.
<p>
   ``Unbelievable, absolutely beautiful,'' gushed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiao</ENAMEX>, a
35-year-old chemical engineer, as he floated 192 miles over
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Pacific</ENAMEX> while secured to Endeavour's
payload bay by a safety tether.
<p>
   ``The view is incredible,'' agreed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry</ENAMEX>, a 42-year-old
physician-engineer. ``There is no other word for it, the colors are
so spectacular.''
<p>
   The two first-time spacewalkers tackled a range of tasks
simulating those that will be required to assemble the sprawling
station complex beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1997</TIMEX>. Despite their rookie
status, the pair adapted quickly to their new environment; their
activities were an hour ahead of schedule at one point.
<p>
   The first of their tasks involved the conversion of the
shuttle's 50-foot-long robot arm into a high-tech cherry picker  &MD;  a
towering mobile work platform that could quickly move a
spacewalking astronaut and a variety of tools to far-flung work
sites. Similar mechanical devices are planned for the space
station.
<p>
   The second task required <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiao</ENAMEX>, his feet planted on the mobile
work platform, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry</ENAMEX>, tethered to the side of Endeavour's
payload bay, to install an 18-foot-long conduit across an expanse
of the ship's cargo hold. Similar apparatus on the space station
will enclose utility lines.
<p>
   Using hand tools, the two men practiced installing several kinds
of power and fluid cables and evaluated the ease with which several
types of fasteners could be connected and disconnected.
<p>
   ``The lessons we are learning here will be folded directly into
station design, so we can make sure it is a workable and mature
facility,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daryl Schuck</ENAMEX>, who supervised the excursion from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mission Control</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Aeronautics and Space
Administration</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION|LOCATION">Johnson Space Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Working closely with the spacewalkers were Endeavour pilot <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brent
Jett</ENAMEX> and Japanese astronaut <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koichi Wakata</ENAMEX>, who operated the robot
arm. Astronaut <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winston Scott</ENAMEX> is scheduled to join <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiao</ENAMEX> on a second
spacewalk <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early Wednesday</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott</ENAMEX> will test several spacesuit
improvements intended to permit work in conditions where
temperatures can be lower than 100 degrees below zero.
<p>
   The six-man shuttle crew plans to retrieve <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10 million</NUMEX>
Spartan science satellite <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>. The spacecraft was deployed
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</TIMEX> of experiments.
<p>
   One of Endeavour's orbital cooling systems shut down abruptly
during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>'s spacewalk. It was the third time since liftoff that
astronauts have had trouble with the flash evaporation system,
which is used intermittently with other cooling systems to
dissipate heat generated by sunlight and the shuttle's electronics.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff Bantle</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> mission operations director, said engineers
believe a buildup of ice has clogged the system's plumbing. Some
shuttle electronics were turned off and other measures were taken
to prevent the problem from interfering with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>'s activities.
<p>
   However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bantle</ENAMEX> would not rule out the possibility that the
mission could be cut short if the system is not repaired.
<p>
   The shuttle is scheduled to land <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early Saturday</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION|LOCATION">Kennedy Space Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX>.

ASTRONAUTS GRAB SATELLITE, PREPARE FOR SECOND SPACEWALK
(For use by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times News Service</ENAMEX> clients.)

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">HOUSTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Space shuttle Endeavour astronauts snared their second
orbiting satellite <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> and prepared for their second spacewalk
to test equipment for future assembly of an international space
station.
<p>
   Japanese astronaut <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koichi Wakata</ENAMEX>, the shuttle crew's prime robot
arm operator, grabbed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10 million</NUMEX> Spartan science satellite
at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4:47 a.m. EST</TIMEX> following a flawless rendezvous that placed the
two spacecraft side by side, 190 miles above the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific Ocean</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koichi</ENAMEX> is two for two,'' Endeavour commander <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Duffy</ENAMEX>, who
flew the rendezvous with pilot <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brent Jett</ENAMEX>, told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mission Control</ENAMEX> at
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION|LOCATION">Johnson Space Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Early Saturday</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wakata</ENAMEX> used the arm to grab the Space Flyer
Unit, a Japanese-launched science satellite circling nearly 300
miles above <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The 2,600-pound Spartan contained four experiments, each
intended to help spacecraft engineers develop materials and
electronics components for lower-weight satellites. The findings
will be studied after Endeavour lands.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Late Tuesday</TIMEX>, astronauts <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winston Scott</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leroy Chiao</ENAMEX> were to
don bulky spacesuits for a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six-hour</TIMEX> excursion into the shuttle's
open payload bay.
<p>
   During the spacewalk, which was to begin at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">11:56 p.m. EST</TIMEX>,
mission planners hoped to expose the two men to temperatures
averaging 100 degrees below zero, similar to those astronauts will
face during space station assembly, by turning the cargo bay away
from the sun and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>'s surface.
<p>
   The objective was to determine how well the improved garb will
keep the astronauts warm.
<p>
   The two also planned to assemble a portable work platform,
assess hand tools and evaluate the ease with which they can connect
and disconnect a variety of fasteners that are slated for use in
station construction.
<p>
   Meanwhile, shuttle managers on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> continued efforts to free
one of Endeavour's cooling systems of an ice jam, a problem that
has the potential to curtail the flight.
<p>
   Once the second spacewalk was under way, ground controllers
planned to raise the air pressure in the shuttle's crew cabin. The
higher pressure will permit them to flush the shuttle's iced flash
evaporator system with warm Freon. Engineers believe several
flushes will free the ice, as it has when similar problems arose on
past missions.
<p>
   ``I wouldn't say it couldn't happen,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff Bantle</ENAMEX>, the mission
operations director, said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> of a potential flight
curtailment. ``But now, we're very confident this process will
clear the ice.''
<p>
   Endeavour's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine-day</TIMEX> mission is scheduled to end <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early Saturday</TIMEX>.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">HOUSTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine-day</TIMEX> mission nearly complete, the Endeavour
astronauts slowed their work pace <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>, enjoying a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">half-day</TIMEX> of
free time and preparing the shuttle for its return to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The six-man crew is scheduled to make a rare landing in darkness
at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION|LOCATION">Kennedy Space Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2:42 a.m. EST</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Forecasters expect a cold front to move through <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX>, leaving
clear, dry conditions.
<p>
   ``The weather looks real good,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> flight director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff
Bantle</ENAMEX>, who will supervise the landing operation from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mission
Control</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION|LOCATION">Johnson Space Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ENAMEX> engineers touted
an experiment aboard Endeavour called the shuttle laser altimeter.
The low-power laser mounted in the payload bay has been fired at
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>'s surface more than 2.5 million times since Endeavour
blasted off.
<p>
   By recording the reflected signal, scientists at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION|LOCATION">Goddard
Space Flight Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greenbelt</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Md.</ENAMEX>, have been able to measure
the elevation of a wide range of surface features, including the
volcano <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mauna Kea</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mount Everest</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Himalayas</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Red Sea</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX> and towering treetops in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Laos</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Each pulse of the laser produces an invisible splash of energy
about the size of a football field on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>'s surface, said
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Garvin</ENAMEX>, the project's science team leader.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garvin</ENAMEX> said engineers hope to use the findings from the
experiment to develop a permanently orbiting instrument that could
be used to monitor changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>'s environment.
<p>
   Since blasting off <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan. 11</TIMEX>, the six-man shuttle crew has
retrieved a 300-mile-high Japanese science spacecraft called the
Space Flyer Unit, deployed and retrieved an experiment-laden <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>
satellite and conducted two long spacewalks.
<p>
   According to Japanese astronaut <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Koichi Wakata</ENAMEX>, the Endeavour
crew's robot arm operator, the flight has been a model of
international cooperation between his country and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United
States</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``I think international cooperation is the most important thing
in proceeding into the future frontier of space,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wakata</ENAMEX> told a
gathering of schoolchildren in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Johannesburg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Africa</ENAMEX>, who
questioned the astronauts with the help of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States
Information Agency</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The Japanese are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s international space station partners
along with the space agencies of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russia</ENAMEX>.

CABLE COMPANIES PART WAYS ON STRATEGY FOR SATELLITE TV
(bl)

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner Inc.</ENAMEX>, the
nation's two biggest cable television operators, have parted ways
in what had been a joint effort to launch satellite services that
beam as many as 150 channels of television directly to individual
homes.
<p>
   With the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Communications Commission</ENAMEX> scheduled to auction
off two valuable satellite licenses <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications</ENAMEX>
announced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> that it would be a bidder in competition with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI
Communications Inc.</ENAMEX> and perhaps several other companies.
<p>
   But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications</ENAMEX>' longtime partner in the satellite
television business, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Primestar Partners</ENAMEX>, announced that it would
not be a bidder and had instead agreed to buy a separate and
somewhat less sophisticated and less powerful satellite.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Primestar</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bala-Cynwyd</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pa.</ENAMEX>, is a consortium owned by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comcast Corporation</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Continental Cablevision</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Using an old pair of satellites that need to be replaced,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Primestar</ENAMEX> has signed up nearly 1 million subscribers who receive
service on 36-inch-wide satellite dishes.
<p>
   The top provider of ``direct broadcast'' service is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DirecTV</ENAMEX>, a
unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes Communications</ENAMEX>, which uses high-powered satellites
to beam more than 100 channels of programming to pizza-sized
satellite antennas that can fit on a windowsill. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DirecTV</ENAMEX> has
slightly more than one million subscribers. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes Communications</ENAMEX>
is a subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX>
<p>
   Executives close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Primestar</ENAMEX> consortium said that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> had disagreed about the wisdom
of bidding on licenses for high-powered satellite service, and that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> executives believed it would be cheaper and more
practical to use a less ambitious technology for at least <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few
years</TIMEX>.
<p>
   But the upshot of the rift is yet another bewildering media
alliance, in which companies are both rivals and partners at the
same time.
<p>
   If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications</ENAMEX> wins a license <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</TIMEX>, it will be
poised to compete with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Primestar</ENAMEX> or to supply satellite capacity to
some other new direct-broadcast rival.
<p>
   That would only further complicate the relationship Between
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-communications</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX>. Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Denver</ENAMEX> company
owns a big stake of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turner Broadcasting System</ENAMEX>, which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX>
wants to buy, it could soon become a big shareholder in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time
Warner</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   On top of all that, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications</ENAMEX> recently formed an
alliance with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rupert Murdoch</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX> to begin a
satellite-delivered sports television service. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX> is
also aligned with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX>, which will bid against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Executives at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications</ENAMEX> said they had no intention of
leaving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Primestar</ENAMEX> consortium. But if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications</ENAMEX> wins
one of the new satellite licenses, it would have the capacity to
compete head-to-head with its old partners.
<p>
   It remains unclear whether that is the company's goal, and
executives at the company refused to discuss their plans in any
form.
<p>
   Meanwhile, several big telephone companies said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> that they
would not participate in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</TIMEX>'s auction. Among those declining
to bid on the new licenses are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&AMP;T Corp.</ENAMEX> and at least six of the
regional Bell companies  &MD;  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nynex Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell Atlantic</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwestern
Bell</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific Telesis Group</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ameritech</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US West</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> has long said it would be a bidder and would start the
bidding at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$175 million</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> has teamed up with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX> in a
broad media alliance, though the two companies have not said what
kind of services they plan to offer over the new system if they win
the bidding.
<p>
   The auction <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> is the result of a tangled legal and
regulatory battle that began more than a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year ago</TIMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX>
blocked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Primestar Partners</ENAMEX> from acquiring one of the last available
licenses for a direct-to-home broadcast satellite that could serve
the entire continental <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Primestar</ENAMEX> had been planning to buy the license from a small
company that got it for free years ago and had never used it. But
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> decided that the company had waited too long to act on its
license and would be getting an undeserved windfall. So it refused
to allow the deal to go through and instead set up the auction that
will take place <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Primestar</ENAMEX> is challenging the auction in court, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Court of
Appeals</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> will hear oral arguments in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James L. Gray</ENAMEX>, chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Primestar Partners</ENAMEX>, said
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> that his group had decided that bidding on a high-powered
license would be too expensive for the time being.
<p>
   ``To pursue high power didn't make sense,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gray</ENAMEX> said in an
interview. ``We had a need to move on. We felt we didn't want to
wait around for something as uncertain as this.''
<p>
   A person close to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> confirmed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> that it had run
into strong disagreements with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications</ENAMEX>. The
high-powered satellites that would be operational with the new
licenses being auctioned off can reach smaller and less obtrusive
antennas about 18 inches in diameter.
<p>
   The medium-powered satellites used by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Primestar</ENAMEX> currently
require antennas about 36 inches in diameter, though the new
satellite will allow slightly smaller antennas.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Satellife</ENAMEX>'s founder, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lown</ENAMEX>, 74, is as well-known for his medical
innovations as he is for his political and social activism. He is
credited with conceiving the modern cardiac-care unit and he
founded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War</ENAMEX>,
an organization that won the Nobel Peace Prize in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX>.
<p>
   And when he set up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Satellife</ENAMEX>, it was out of recognition that
technology and activism might be combined. He received
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">multimillion-dollar</NUMEX> grants from corporations including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEC</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&AMP;T</ENAMEX>, that have since been supplemented by donors who include the
actor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hume Cronyn</ENAMEX> and the media mogul <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Turner</ENAMEX>
<p>
   ``Ignorance fosters chaos,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lown</ENAMEX>, who realized that in
most of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">sub-Saharan Africa</ENAMEX>, medical professionals were hampered by
an appallingly inadequate communications system. Voice, fax and
video-conference transmissions were either unavailable or made
unaffordable by government-run telecommunications agencies.
<p>
   What was required was some sort of ``off line'' or ``store and
forward'' communications system that did not require connections to
the real-time telephone network.
<p>
   So <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lown</ENAMEX> and his advisers settled on so-called low-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX>-orbit
satellite technology. The approach is in stark contrast to the
giant geostationary satellites, which are commonly used for
telephone and television transmissions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   These complex spacecraft, costing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">several hundred million
dollars</NUMEX> to build and up to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$20 million</NUMEX> more to launch, are
positioned over the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">equator</ENAMEX> at an altitude of more than 22,000
miles, where they orbit in unison with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX>'s rotation,
seeming to hang in a fixed position.
<p>
   A low-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX> satellite, which would be the size of a television
set and would zip around the globe at an altitude of only 550
miles, could be built and launched for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1 million</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Satellife</ENAMEX> bought
and launched Healthsat 1 in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years later</TIMEX> sent up a
more sophisticated replacement, Healthsat 2, which cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2.2
million</NUMEX>. Both were paid for with private donations.
<p>
   Taking <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">100 minutes</TIMEX> for each pole-to-pole orbit of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX>, the
satellite makes 14 circumnavigations a day. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Every 24 hours</TIMEX>, any
given spot on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX> is within electronic range of the satellite at
least four times.
<p>
   Each time the satellite comes into view, an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX> station has
approximately <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">13 minutes</TIMEX> to exchange data with Healthsat 2 via
radio signal. The network's software allows the spacecraft to poll
each <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX> station in turn, collecting any stored messages and
downloading any information collected elsewhere on the globe and
addressed to that particular station.
<p>
   The equipment for each ground station costs less than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$15,000</NUMEX>.
And as telephone service is gradually improving in some African
cities, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Healthnet</ENAMEX> subscriber can use a modem to transmit messages
via local phone line to a centrally located <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX> station, rather
than requiring a satellite antenna at each site.
<p>
   ``We've devised a system that can easily be replicated within a
country for free,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Mullaney</ENAMEX>, executive director of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Satellife</ENAMEX>. ``It is a medical information system that can be run by
Africans for Africans and can be sustained internally.''

   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Paul Walsh</ENAMEX>, an engineer who was the scientist at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cape
Canaveral</ENAMEX> in charge of the launching of the second <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> satellite
to go into orbit, died <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan. 19</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian River Community Hospital</ENAMEX>
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vero Beach</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX> He was 78 and lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vero Beach</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The cause was cancer, his family said.
<p>
   The Vanguard Satellite Program on which he worked was begun by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naval Research Laboratory</ENAMEX>. As Vanguard's deputy director, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walsh</ENAMEX>
was in charge of the launching site in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1957</TIMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>
first tried to loft its answer to the Sputnik satellite that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> had put in orbit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two months earlier</TIMEX>.
<p>
   That first effort ended in failure, as the rocket sputtered
shortly after lift-off and settled back in a mass of flames and
smoke. After the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> succeeded in launching the Explorer
1 on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan. 31, 1958</TIMEX>, another try with the Vanguard 1 in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 1958</TIMEX>
was smooth, and the satellite went into orbit, where it remains as
the oldest man-made object circling <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Later that year</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Aeronautics and Space
Administration</ENAMEX> took over the Vanguard program and its staff from
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walsh</ENAMEX> left <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that December</TIMEX> for private employment after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16
years</TIMEX> with the naval laboratory.
<p>
   Born in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fall River</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>, he was a mechanical engineering
graduate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stevens Institute of Technology</ENAMEX> and earned an M.S.
degree at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Maryland</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Working for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> in World War II, he specialized in the
field of shock and vibration. He studied the strain put on a
warship in firing all guns at once and measured pressure generated
by atomic bombs detonated above the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> after the war.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walsh</ENAMEX> is survived by his wife of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53 years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joan Edwards Walsh</ENAMEX>;
two sons, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Jr.</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boulder</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colo.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rye</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y;</ENAMEX> a

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan. 24</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI Communications Corp.</ENAMEX> led
the bidding in the ninth round of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Communications
Commission</ENAMEX>'s auction of a nationwide direct broadcast satellite
license with an offer of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$332 million</NUMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Echostar DBS Corp.</ENAMEX>, the other two
bidders in the auction, didn't bid in the latest round. Auction
rules provide for the use of five waivers for each of the three
bidders. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCI</ENAMEX> took one of its waivers for the ninth round, while
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Echostar</ENAMEX> was given a bye for making the highest bid in the eighth
round -- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$313.3 million</NUMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX>, the nation's No. 2 long-distance phone company, plans to
develop its satellite service with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rupert Murdoch</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX> if
it wins the license.
<p>
   The auction's tenth round has already begun. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> has put the
minimum bid for that round at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$348.6 million</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">five percent</NUMEX> higher
than the previous round's highest bid.
<p>
   The DBS license provides the rights to satellite perches for the
delivery of video and high-speed data transmissions that can be
picked up by 18-inch dishes. This kind of wireless capability could
allow phone companies and cable-TV providers to provide wireless
communications and data and video services throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
<p>
   The DBS license, one of only three that reach the entire
continental <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>, went on the block at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> auction
site at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:30 a.m. EST</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The commission will auction a second license, considered less
valuable because it reaches mostly just the western half of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> after the conclusion of the first auction. Only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Echostar</ENAMEX> have applied to bid on this license.
<p>
   In the opening round <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCI</ENAMEX> had the highest bid at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$201
million</NUMEX> followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$175.2 million</NUMEX> opening bid. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Echostar</ENAMEX>, a
division of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Echostar Communications Corp.</ENAMEX>, weighed in with a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$125
million</NUMEX> bid.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> shares were up 1/2 at 27 7/8 in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> trading. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCI</ENAMEX>
shares were down 1/8 at 20 3/8. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Echostar</ENAMEX> shares were up 3/8 at 24
3/8.
<p>
   The auction will continue until two of the bidders drop out,
which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> officials expect to happen sometime <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``The American consumer will be the real winner of this
auction,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Blake Harris</ENAMEX>, chief of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX>'s
international bureau. ``It will lead to the prompt introduction of
new DBS competitors and additional DBS service.''
<p>
   Still, most other companies considered potential bidders
--including all seven Baby Bell telephone operating companies,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sprint Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&AMP;T Corp.</ENAMEX> -- didn't participate in the sale,
shrinking the field.
<p>
   Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&AMP;T</ENAMEX> may have found a less risky, and quicker, way to
get into the business. The telecommunications giant announced
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> an agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM Hughes Electronic Corp.</ENAMEX> to market and
distribute <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DirecTV</ENAMEX> digital TV programming.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> said before the auction that it would consider using the
license to provide digital TV programming, similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes</ENAMEX>'
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DirecTV</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> made a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2 billion</NUMEX> investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murdoch</ENAMEX>'s
international media company <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> and plans several joint
ventures. The first, a sports pager service, was launched <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last
October</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Customers can buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DirecTV</ENAMEX>'s 18-inch disks at an electronics
retailer, attach the disks to their homes and get as many as 150
channels of movies, sports and other programs.
<p>
   ``If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> can get into the (media) game via satellite as a
competitive response, I think they should do it,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Craig
Ellis</ENAMEX>, an analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wheat First Butcher Singer</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The three bidders for the nationwide license had to pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10
million</NUMEX> in application fees, while the application charge was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2
million</NUMEX> for the second slot.
<p>
   The down payments aren't counted against the final bid, and are
returned to bidders that don't win a license unless a bidder
engages in improper bidding, such as pulling out after making a
high bid.

<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A few months ago</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Sturman</ENAMEX> invested in the future to buy back
a piece of his past.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sturman</ENAMEX>, a psychology professor at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Southern
Maine</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Portland</ENAMEX>, sorely missed the sports teams of his native
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>  &MD;  so much so that he laid out nearly <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$700</NUMEX> for a satellite-TV
system that offers him the sports channels shown to the
Clevelanders back home.
<p>
   ``Now, I can watch an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indians</ENAMEX> game at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> or settle down with
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cleveland Browns</ENAMEX> on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sturman</ENAMEX>, who's lived in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Portland</ENAMEX> for just over a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>. ``I see local commercials from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>
that bring me back to my childhood.''
<p>
   The system <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sturman</ENAMEX> bought, however, hardly harkens back to the
Volkswagen-size satellite dishes of yore. The new satellite-TV
systems are more like Hot Wheels cars: smaller, sleeker, and soon
to be very affordable.
<p>
   Although not quite <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> old, small-dish satellites setups
are already found in almost 2 million American households.
<p>
   Until the birth of these compact systems, a satellite-TV dish
spanned ten feet and cost around <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2,000</NUMEX>.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>, a system requires an investment of just <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$200</NUMEX>, nestles
inconspicuously on the roof of a home or apartment building, and
delivers exclusive programming. And with newcomers joining the
satellite market soon, prices are expected to drop and choices to
multiply.
<p>
   ``Once the competition heats up, they'll probably start giving
the hardware away just to get eyeballs,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Scott</ENAMEX>, editor
of Satellite TV Week.
<p>
   For now, though, two small-dish satellite systems are available:
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA</ENAMEX> Digital Satellite System, which offers two programming
choices  &MD;  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DirecTV</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USSB</ENAMEX>  &MD;  and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Primestar</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA</ENAMEX> dish costs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$550 to $1,000</NUMEX> (depending on the model) plus
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$199</NUMEX> for installation; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Primestar</ENAMEX> leases its dish for an up-front
payment of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$200</NUMEX>, including installation.
<p>
   But before beaming into space, know that network broadcasting is
not always included, meaning no ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seinfeld</ENAMEX>'' or ``X-Files'' unless
the viewer gets a basic cable hookup (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10 to $25</NUMEX> per month plus
installation) or adds an antenna to get the local network
affiliates.
<p>
   Or the satellite company will zap you a network signal from a
distant city for a nominal fee.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DirecTV</ENAMEX>, which runs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$29.95</NUMEX> a month, boasts a 65-network channel
menu similar to cable's (CNN, CNBC, etc.), 29 audio-only channels,
and 7 movie channels.
<p>
   And sports zealots take note: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DirecTV</ENAMEX> offers an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFL</ENAMEX> package
(choose any of 13 games <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every Sunday</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$139</NUMEX>), an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBA</ENAMEX> package (all
700 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">regular-season</TIMEX> games for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$149</NUMEX>), and an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHL</ENAMEX> package (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$99</NUMEX> for the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">whole season</TIMEX>).
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DirecTV</ENAMEX> offered its Major League Baseball package for
free, but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX>'s edition will carry a price tag that has yet
to be announced.
<p>
   For premium channels, you need to add <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USSB</ENAMEX> to the mix. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USSB</ENAMEX>
carries 21 programming options for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$34.95</NUMEX> a month, including five
HBO, three Showtime, three Cinemax, and two Movie Channel channels.
<p>
   With <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Primestar</ENAMEX>, which for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$45</NUMEX> a month offers 90 channels, in
addition to the standard cable lineup, you can click from 16
regional sports networks to movie channels that show only westerns
or mysteries.
<p>
   There are also three HBO and two Cinemax channels airing
different shows, thanks to feeds from different time zones.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Primestar</ENAMEX> also offers season-long sports packages similar to those
on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DirecTV</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   New providers are coming: In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-December</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AlphaStar</ENAMEX> launched
programming, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EchoStar</ENAMEX> will debut in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``Unlike cable, the satellite industry is wide open to
competition,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott</ENAMEX>. ``There will be better prices and wider
variety as new companies emerge.'' After all, there's plenty of
room in space.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications Inc.</ENAMEX> dropped out of the bidding
on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> in the federal government's auction of a coveted
satellite television license, after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI Communications Corp.</ENAMEX>
offered <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$472 million</NUMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI Communications</ENAMEX>, which has an alliance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX>, will
return on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> along with the one remaining bidder, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Echostar
Communications Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Englewood</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colo.</ENAMEX>
<p>
   All three companies are seeking to challenge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DirecTV</ENAMEX>, which
started the first ``direct broadcast'' service and can transmit
about 150 channels of programming to pizza-sized antennas.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DirecTV</ENAMEX>, which is owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes Electronics</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General
Motors Corp.</ENAMEX>, has 1.2 million customers so far and formed a
partnership with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&AMP;T Corp.</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> that should greatly increase
its marketing power.
<p>
   The bidding, which came in at about the midpoint of estimates by
outside experts, was a big setback for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications</ENAMEX>, which
had originally planned to buy the license for only <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$40 million</NUMEX> from
a start-up company that got the license free in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1980s</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Communications Commission</ENAMEX> killed that plan <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>
after declaring that the start-up company had been sitting on the
license too long. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications</ENAMEX> now owns two nearly completed
satellites for which it has spent upward of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$500 million</NUMEX>, but it
has no place now to use them.
<p>
   ``They're too big to use for paperweights,'' said a disappointed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Beddows</ENAMEX>, vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications</ENAMEX>, who headed
the company's bidding efforts on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>. The company is still
trying to challenge the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX>'s earlier decision in federal court in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, and a hearing has been scheduled for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 18</TIMEX>.
<p>
   If the legal effort fails, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications</ENAMEX> may still be able
to lease or buy other satellite capacity. It also remains a partner
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Primestar Partners</ENAMEX>, which offers a less sophisticated
direct-broadcast service that can be received on satellite dishes
about 3 feet in diameter.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>'s auction could have a big impact on both the
fast-growing satellite television market and the traditional
cable-television industry.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications</ENAMEX>, while revealing little about its strategy,
clearly wants to develop a space-based distribution system that
would supplement its huge base of ground-based cable-television
systems.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Malone</ENAMEX>, chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications</ENAMEX>, has spoken
for years about developing a ``head-end in the sky''  &MD;  that is, in
cable jargon, the place from which programs are distributed. He
appears to have visions of using direct-broadcast satellites as a
means to reach homes directly and as a sort of wholesaler for other
cable systems.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX>, which is owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rupert Murdoch</ENAMEX>, have been
vague about their plans but have talked about using the satellites
to transmit information services and computer data as well as
traditional television programming.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&AMP;T</ENAMEX>, which stayed out of the auction, decided instead to pay
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$135 million</NUMEX> for a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5 percent</NUMEX> stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DirecTV</ENAMEX> and market its
service under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&AMP;T</ENAMEX>'s brand name and through its giant sales force.
<p>
   The most intriguing bidder is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Echostar</ENAMEX>, a little-known company
that already owns two licenses for direct-broadcast satellite
service and launched its first satellite on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Dec. 28</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Echostar</ENAMEX>'s
current licenses will allow it to beam about 150 channels of
television once the company launches a second satellite <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late this
year</TIMEX>.
<p>
   But the company wants to acquire the new license, which would
allow it to broadcast more than 200 channels. If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Echostar</ENAMEX> wins the
bidding against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> has said the company will have to sell
one of the licenses it already owns.
<p>
   ``We want to trade up,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Ergen</ENAMEX>, chairman and chief
executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Echostar</ENAMEX>, who was at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>'s auction.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Echostar</ENAMEX>, which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ergen</ENAMEX> founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>, currently offers
satellite television services over relatively low-powered ``C
Band'' satellites that require antennas that are 4 and 5 feet in
diameter.
<p>
   The company had revenues of about <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$180 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>. After
raising <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$335 million</NUMEX> in a debt offering, it built and launched a
high-powered satellite <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six weeks ago</TIMEX> aboard a Chinese Long March
rocket.
<p>
   That satellite will allow it to transmit about 75 channels of
television or other information service, and a second satellite
schedule for launch in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last quarter of 1996</TIMEX> would double that
capacity to 150.
<p>
   Winning the auction, however, would give it a slightly more
desirable orbital parking space and lift total capacity to about
200 channels.
<p>
   Experts had predicted before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>'s auction that the high
bid would be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $300 million and $700 million</NUMEX>. Many of the
nation's biggest communication companies  &MD;  including all seven
regional Bell companies  &MD;  decided not to participate at all.
<p>
   Unless <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Echostar</ENAMEX> decides not to challenge's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX>'s current high
bid, however, the license should sell for more than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$500 million</NUMEX>.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran</ENAMEX> has increased its military power in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian Gulf</ENAMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>, most recently by testing a new
Chinese cruise missile fired from a ship, senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> officials
said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Along with sea mines, two Soviet attack submarines, five Chinese
patrol boats and land-based missiles, the new weapon could increase
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran</ENAMEX>'s ability to try to close the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Strait of Hormuz</ENAMEX>  &MD;  the gateway
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian Gulf</ENAMEX> and its oil  &MD;  in times of tension or war.
<p>
   None of the officials said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran</ENAMEX>'s test of the Chinese-built
cruise missile in the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arabian Sea</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan. 6</TIMEX> was a
significant challenge. The test ``does not make them a major threat
to our naval forces or to commercial shipping in the area,'' said
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>'s chief spokesman, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken Bacon</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   But Vice Adm. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Redd</ENAMEX>, who commands <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> naval
forces in the region, said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> that the test signified ``a new
dimension'' to military strategy in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gulf</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Redd</ENAMEX> said the missile, called the C-802, was about as powerful
as the Exocet, fired by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iraq</ENAMEX> in its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX> attack on the frigate
Stark, killing 37 Americans. The Chinese cruise missile flies
closer to the ocean's surface than the Exocet and is harder for
radar to detect.
<p>
   The test of the missile, which was fired from an Iranian patrol
boat and monitored by a British ship and by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> intelligence
satellites, took <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several days</TIMEX> and was not completely successful,
military and intelligence officials said.
<p>
   But the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran</ENAMEX> can place a cruise missile with a 60-mile
range on a boat ``allows the missiles to come at you from any
direction,'' not just a fixed position on land, said Cmdr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">T.
McCreary</ENAMEX>, a spokesman for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fifth Fleet</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bahrain</ENAMEX>.
Tracking mobile missiles, as allied forces learned in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gulf</ENAMEX> war,
is nearly impossible.
<p>
   ``It's not overwhelming, but it is now just one more thing in
the Iranians' bag of tricks,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCreary</ENAMEX> said. ``As you add them all
together it makes the job a lot tougher. Still, we certainly can
deal with the threat.'' Military and intelligence officials said
the deployment of the missile did not mean it would be fired in
anger. But they said it was hard to tell what <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran</ENAMEX> was up to on any
front, military or political, given a lack of hard information from
inside its ruling councils.
<p>
   ``It's much more difficult for us to gauge intentions than it is
to gauge capabilities,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bacon</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> spokesman. ``We
don't know where they're going; we don't know what their intentions
are.''

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ottawa</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan. 31</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- State-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian Broadcasting
Corp.</ENAMEX> should be financed through a tax on cable TV and
direct-to-home satellite services, rather than the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C$1 billion</NUMEX>
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$727 million</NUMEX>) in federal grants it currently relies on, a
Canadian government report said.
<p>
   Former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBC</ENAMEX> chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierre Juneau</ENAMEX>, head of the panel that wrote
the report, said he was recommending ``significant changes'' for
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50-year</TIMEX> old radio and television service that broadcasts
nationwide in both English and French.
<p>
   In order to avoid ``deep and damaging cuts,'' the committee
recommended a new <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.5 percent</NUMEX> ``Communications Distribution Tax''
to be applied to all cable and direct-to-home satellite services.
<p>
   The tax would be phased in over a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five-year</TIMEX> period beginning
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this spring</TIMEX> and would ``free more than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C$800 million</NUMEX> a year either
for deficit-reduction ... or high-priority spending initiatives.''
<p>
   There was no immediate reaction from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rogers Communications Inc.</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>'s largest cable television supplier, nor from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toronto</ENAMEX>-based
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ExpressVu</ENAMEX>, which will soon launch its direct-to-home satellite TV
service. Canadian cable distributors, though, earlier criticized
the idea of new consumer taxes.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juneau</ENAMEX>, who headed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBC</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE"><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven years</TIMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX></TIMEX>, was
commissioned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last spring</TIMEX> by Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean Chretien</ENAMEX> after
deficit-cutting efforts looked likely to erode the broadcaster's
financing.
<p>
   In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late November</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBC</ENAMEX> said it would lay off as many as 1,000
people by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late March</TIMEX> as it prepares to get by with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C$227 million
less</NUMEX> in government grants <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The new financing scheme would be made available for a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven-year</TIMEX> period, at which time the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Radio Canada</ENAMEX>, the
sister French service, would have to present a new corporate
spending plan.
<p>
   ``To cushion the introduction of the levy somewhat for
consumers,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juneau</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsworld</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RDI</ENAMEX>, the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24-hour</TIMEX> cable
French- and English-language news services, should drop their
monthly subscriber fees that range up to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C$0.90</NUMEX> a month.
<p>
   ``In no way would this restrict <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parliament</ENAMEX>'s authority to change
the level of funding to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBC</ENAMEX>, but it would remove the
requirement for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parliament</ENAMEX> to appropriate funds <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX>,'' the
report said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBC</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perrin Beatty</ENAMEX> said existing funding plans would
cut an additional <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C$350 million</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBC</ENAMEX>'s budget by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 31,
1998</TIMEX>, from its current <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C$1.065 billion</NUMEX> annual budget. The cuts are
part of Finance Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Martin</ENAMEX>'s plan to reduce the budget
deficit to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 percent</NUMEX> of gross domestic product, from its present
level of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 percent</NUMEX>.

<p>
   A new ``mother ship'' to carry the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institute</ENAMEX>'s manned submersible, Alvin, and deep-diving robot
explorers is scheduled to be launched <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moss Point</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miss.</ENAMEX>, where the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$50 million</NUMEX> state-of-the-art ship was built.
<p>
   The 274-foot research vessel Atlantis will replace Atlantis II,
a smaller ship being retired after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33 years</TIMEX> of service for the
institute and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Navy</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   When work on its systems is completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, the new Atlantis
will be among the most sophisticated oceanographic research ships
in the world. It has four times the on-board laboratory space of
Atlantis II, can carry more scientists, and has twice the endurance
at sea.
<p>
   ``This is a great event for us,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Pittenger</ENAMEX>,
associate director of marine operations for the institute, in a
telephone interview <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>. ``We just took a tour, and the ship
is absolutely magnificent,'' he said.
<p>
   Following the traditional christening with champagne, shipyard
workers plan to to send the 274-foot research vessel down greased
skids in a spectacular sideways launch, splashing it into a bayou
where it will rock back and forth before coming to rest upright.
<p>
   The ship's electronic systems and other equipment remain to be
installed during the ``fitting out'' period, scheduled to end with
delivery of Atlantis by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 15, 1997</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pittenger</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   Equipped for general oceanographic research and to support
undersea exploration, Atlantis will serve as mother ship for Alvin,
the first deep-diving submarine, which was commissioned in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1964</TIMEX> and
has made more than 3,000 scientific dives. Also based aboard
Atlantis will be the JASON/Medea system of remotely controlled
undersea craft that can reach <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98 percent</NUMEX> of the world's ocean
floor.
<p>
   The ship will also be home to the institute's new Autonomous
Benthic Explorer, a robot craft that can remain on the ocean floor
for as long as a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> to observe marine life or monitor sunken
submarines or other potential sources of pollution.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Navy</ENAMEX> financed construction of Atlantis and, although it
will be operated under a charter agreement by the private,
nonprofit oceanographic institution, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> has the right to use
the ship and its submersible craft in the event of national
security emergencies.
<p>
   Atlantis is the third of four vessels being built for the
academic ocean research community.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">HOUSTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> is weeks away from totaling the costs of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> administration decision to shoulder some of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russia</ENAMEX>'s
financial burden for the planned international space station, a top
space agency official said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wil Trafton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s acting spaceflight chief and space station
program director, also said the Russians have been warned they risk
expulsion from the project, if their financial and political
difficulties cause more upheaval. The decision to lighten <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russia</ENAMEX>'s
responsibilities was made to keep the project on schedule.
<p>
   ``This can't go on,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trafton</ENAMEX> said at a news briefing. ``We have
made it clear we are simply going to be unable to help them, if a
problem of this magnitude should arise in the future.''
<p>
   Assembly of the global outpost is to begin in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 1997</TIMEX> and
conclude in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-2002</TIMEX>. Crucial early Russian components will provide
guidance and living space for three occupants by the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring of
1998</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> are also involved in the project.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Late last year</TIMEX>, the Russians proposed a major design change that
would incorporate their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10-year</TIMEX>-old Mir space station into the new
facility, a strategy intended to save them money and avoid the
political problems associated with decommissioning the venerable
outpost in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1998</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Earlier this week</TIMEX>, Vice President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> announced the
provisions of a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> counteroffer intended to keep the assembly
plans for the new international station on schedule, yet help the
Russians keep operating Mir until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the turn of the century</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> will increase from seven to at least nine the number of
shuttle flights it plans to Mir in order to ferry the food, water,
clothing and other supplies required to keep the Russian station
operating for an additional <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX>.
<p>
   In addition, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> shuttle will transport a Russian electrical
power generator to the new international space station in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>,
lowering from four to one the number of unmanned Russian rocket
launches required to loft the apparatus needed to power research
activities.
<p>
   The Russians also will likely lower the number of habitable
research modules they plan to contribute to the new station or
substitute less expensive components, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trafton</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   ``There is no question there is an additional cost involved
here,'' he said. ``We still have our budget analysts out working
the numbers. We will probably have that number in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next two to
three weeks</TIMEX>.''
<p>
   But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trafton</ENAMEX> hinted that the true cost may take much longer to
assess, at least until after a series of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> meetings between
Russian and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> space experts in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX> to negotiate the full
range of requirements dictated by the concessions.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ENAMEX>
flew two of seven planned docking missions to Mir scheduled through
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> is investing about <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4 billion</NUMEX> on the missions. That
total includes a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$400 million</NUMEX> payment to the Russians for use of
Mir by a handful of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> astronauts for research and some hardware
for the new space station.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>'s offer extends the number of shuttle flights to nine
through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>.
<p>
   But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> has agreed to discuss the possibility of flying more
than the nine missions to Mir, extending the program into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>.
<p>
   So far, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trafton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> has identified only a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$124 million</NUMEX>
cost for the addition of one shuttle visit to Mir, a figure that
could triple or quadruple if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. General Accounting Office</ENAMEX> figures
are substituted.
<p>
   By the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> meeting, negotiators will have assessed new cargo
preparation costs and additional experiment preparation expenses.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> has asked the Russians to modify the interior of their Soyuz
crew capsules to accommodate larger <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> astronauts, an expense
that may be weighed against the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> costs.
<p>
   The three-person Soyuz capsules will serve as lifeboats for
crews stationed aboard the international space station during its
assembly.

<p>
   The plan for an orbital mission to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eros</ENAMEX> has been aggressively
promoted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel S. Goldin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s Administrator for nearly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four
years</TIMEX> and a champion of doing things smaller, cheaper, better,
faster, as he puts it. The flight is the inaugural mission of the
Discovery Program, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> initiative for small planetary missions
with a maximum <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three-year</TIMEX> development time and a maximum cost of
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$150 million</NUMEX>.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eros</ENAMEX> probe is known officially as NEAR, for Near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>
Asteroid Rendezvous. It is scheduled for liftoff on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb. 16</TIMEX> from
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cape Canaveral</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pasadena</ENAMEX> is
to navigate the craft on its journey of more than a billion miles
through space, as the laboratory has done for all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s
deep-space missions.
<p>
   The voyage to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eros</ENAMEX> is complex because the asteroid orbits the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sun</ENAMEX> at an angle 10.8 degrees off that of the disklike plane that
the planets whirl through, loping down many millions of miles below
that horizontal layer in its rush through the solar system. The
probe, to achieve the rendezvous, must match this unconventional
orbit.
<p>
   After its launching, the spacecraft is to swing out far past the
orbit of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX>, passing by the large asteroid <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mathilde</ENAMEX> on this leg
of the journey and possibly photographing it, and then come
barreling back toward <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> for a close flyby in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1998</TIMEX>. At
this point flight controllers will use the planet's gravity to
increase the probe's speed and change its orbital plane to match
that of the prime target.
<p>
   Final maneuvers are to begin in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1999</TIMEX>. As the spacecraft
approaches <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eros</ENAMEX>, it will begin firing a large rocket engine to slow
itself down and match the asteroid's speed, making its first close
encounter in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 1999</TIMEX> at a distance of about 300 miles.
<p>
   If no dangerous satellites are discovered that would hamper a
closer approach, the probe will slowly be maneuvered toward the
asteroid until in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 1999</TIMEX> it reaches its optimal orbit for
scientific study of 20 to 30 miles high. The detailed observations
are to last until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the millennium</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The main scientific aims of the mission are to measure the
asteroid's size, shape, volume, mass, gravity field, spin state,
surface composition, geology, morphology, texture, mass
distribution and magnetic field. To do so, the probe carries a
camera, a gamma-ray spectrometer, a near-infrared spectrograph, a
magnetometer and a laser range finder, among other instruments.
<p>
   Scientists believe that clues to the nature of the early solar
system are preserved on small bodies like asteroids. In contrast,
the cosmic records of large, planetary bodies have been altered or
destroyed over the ages by the traumas of planetary evolution. In
particular, near-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> asteroids are thought to hold clues to the
nature of the building blocks of the inner planets, including
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   In addition to raw scientific insights, the mission to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eros</ENAMEX> is
seen as possibly yielding a flock of findings that may help
humankind wrestle with the possibility of killer rocks descending
on the planet from space. First, a better understanding of
asteroids would aid predictions of how the rocky bodies would
interact with the atmosphere and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> upon fiery impact. Second,
it would aid possible safeguards.
<p>
   ``The more knowledgeable one is about these objects,'' said Dr.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clark R. Chapman</ENAMEX>, a senior scientist at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Planetary Science
Institute</ENAMEX>, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tucson</ENAMEX>, and a member of the mission team, ``the
more we can figure what we'd have to do to move them or otherwise
get out of harm's way.''
<p>
   In recent years, scientists have speculated about using bombs or
rocket engines to nudge threatening asteroids out of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>'s path
or to destroy them.
<p>
   Scientists are closely watching the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eros</ENAMEX> mission not only for
its insights but as a critical test of the space agency's new
small-is-beautiful philosophy, which is sometimes viewed
skeptically by a generation of experts that relied on large budgets
to push the glory days of planetary exploration to the dim edges of
the solar system and beyond.
<p>
   ``These things are being touted as a whole new way of producing
science cheaply,'' said Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph A. Burns</ENAMEX>, an astronomer at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cornell University</ENAMEX> who is a past chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee on
Planetary and Lunar Exploration</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Academy of
Sciences</ENAMEX>, a private group that advises the government. ``But it's
not clear that the science return per <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">dollar</NUMEX> is going to be there.
It's an experiment.''
<p>
   But the chief scientist of the rendezvous mission, Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew F.
Cheng</ENAMEX>, an astrophysicist at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johns Hopkins University</ENAMEX>, said no
corners had been cut to develop the spacecraft, which relies on
many more miniaturized components and innovative materials than did
past probes.
<p>
   ``It's a full-science mission in the grand old tradition,''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheng</ENAMEX> said. ``But it doesn't bust the budget.''

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb. 6</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> cleared
the way <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors Hughes Electronics Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed
Martin Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loral Corp.</ENAMEX> to sell <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundreds of millions of
dollars</NUMEX> in satellites to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The president announced <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this evening</TIMEX> that he has waived export
restrictions on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> satellite technology bound for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> on three
Sino-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> television, voice and data satellite projects.
Administration officials said that the projects had been awaiting a
green light from the president for some time.
<p>
   The first project, Cosat, will use two <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed Martin</ENAMEX>
satellites to provide voice, data and television to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>,
administration officials said. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China Orient Telecom Satellite Co.</ENAMEX>
is joining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed</ENAMEX> in the project and will launch the satellite,
administration officials said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China Telecom Broadcast Satellite Corp.</ENAMEX> will be working with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX>, to launch a television and
data satellite for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinasat</ENAMEX> project to provide television and
data to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>, the officials said.
<p>
   The third project would use <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loral</ENAMEX> technology to beam voice and
data to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philippines</ENAMEX> and neighboring countries, the officials
said. Chinese rockets will launch the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loral</ENAMEX> satellite and have
joined with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philippine Satellite Corp.</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mubuhay</ENAMEX> project.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loral</ENAMEX> agreed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX> to sell most of its operations to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed Martin</ENAMEX>. None of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> companies had any immediate
comment on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> announcement.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> is waiving restrictions put in place by President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George
Bush</ENAMEX> in the wake of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX> bloody suppression of pro-democracy
demonstrators by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">People's Army</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> put a freeze on
licenses for any technology that was on the munitions control list
-- including satellite technology.
<p>
   Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> have issued waivers in the past. Under the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> law, they can give the nod to projects that do not contribute
to the Chinese military and instead provide <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> with more
information and communication technology.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed</ENAMEX> shares fell 3/4 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> to close at 76. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>'s Class H
shares fell 1/8 to 55 3/4. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loral</ENAMEX> shares fell 1/4 to 46 1/2.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">TOKYO</ENAMEX>  &MD;  <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s first test launch of its space shuttle prototype
didn't get off the ground in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb. 9</TIMEX> because of rain.
It was the third time the launch has been postponed.
<p>
   The Hyflex shuttle/glider was scheduled to make a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15-minute</TIMEX>
unmanned flight from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tanegashima Space Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kagoshima
Prefecture</ENAMEX>, beginning at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7 a.m.</TIMEX>
<p>
   Officials rescheduled the test for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7 a.m.</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb. 11</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Hyflex was supposed to shoot up through the atmosphere on its
Japanese-made J-1 booster rocket, then fall back down without
orbiting <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>. It has been programmed to land in the sea around
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ogasawara Islands</ENAMEX> 1,000 kilometers south of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The flight was to test the craft's ability to withstand the
extreme heat of reentering the atmosphere.
<p>
   Like the American space shuttle, the Japanese prototype is
covered with a special material made of carbon designed to
withstand temperatures of up to 1,500 degrees. The unpowered craft
is much smaller than the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> space shuttle. It is designed to
gather data on how to design more sophisticated craft.
<p>
   The launch was postponed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb. 1</TIMEX> because of a functional
problem and again on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb. 7</TIMEX> because of unstable weather around the
landing area.
<p>
   Officials said the J-1 rocket is not able to withstand wet
weather.
<p>
   The repeated postponements caused alarm among officials at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Space Development Agency</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, the Japanese version of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>, because <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one day</TIMEX> of delay costs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">30 million yen</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$286,000</NUMEX>). The
sum includes personnel costs.
<p>
   Fine weather was forecast for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tanegashima</ENAMEX> area on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb. 11</TIMEX>.
However, it is expected to be stormy around the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ogasawara</ENAMEX> region.

the space station by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>.
<p>
   On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb. 10</TIMEX>, another small rocket is scheduled to be launched
from the town of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Uchinoura</ENAMEX>, also in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kagoshima Prefecture</ENAMEX>, which
means the Hyflex cannot go aloft until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb. 11</TIMEX> at the earliest.

<p>
   A Chinese rocket carrying a television satellite exploded
seconds after launch <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>, dealing a potential blow to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rupert
Murdoch</ENAMEX>'s ambitions to offer satellite programming in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin
America</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murdoch</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX> is one of four media companies in a
partnership that had leased space on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelsat</ENAMEX> satellite to
offer the Latin American service. The other partners are
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications Inc.</ENAMEX>, the nation's largest cable operator;
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grupo Televisa SA</ENAMEX>, the Mexican broadcaster and publisher, and the
giant Brazilian media conglomerate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globo</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Llennel Evangelista</ENAMEX>, a spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelsat</ENAMEX>, a global
satellite consortium based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, said the accident
occurred at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 p.m. EST</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>, or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early Thursday morning</TIMEX> at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Xichang</ENAMEX> launch site in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sichuan Province</ENAMEX> in southwestern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>. ``We
have no details on what caused the accident,'' he said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evangelista</ENAMEX> said the Chinese-built Long March rocket veered off
course and was destroyed after it failed to reach orbit. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelsat</ENAMEX>
was using the Long March rocket for the first time to launch one of
its satellites. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelsat</ENAMEX> currently has 23 satellites in orbit.
<p>
   A spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Rubenstein</ENAMEX>, said the accident
would not hinder the group's plans to offer 150 channels of
entertainment, news and sports programming to viewers in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin
America</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX> has a number of other real options and will
disclose them shortly,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rubinstein</ENAMEX> said in a statement.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grupo Televisa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globo</ENAMEX> plan to offer national and local
programming in Spanish and Portuguese. Initially, the venture's
partners said they planned to invest <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$500 million</NUMEX>.
<p>
   But a similar explosion <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> delayed the plans of several
American media companies to offer a package of satellite television
services in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Home Box Office</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turner
Broadcasting System</ENAMEX> were among the companies that had leased space
on an Apstar 2 satellite to beam MTV, CNN and other channels
throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   After the rocket carrying that satellite exploded, media
analysts said the companies had to settle for space on a series of
regional satellites, which had less reach than the Apstar 2 would
have offered.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX> actually benefited from that accident. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, the
company had purchased a controlling stake in a rival Asian
satellite service, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star TV</ENAMEX>. With his biggest competitors unable to
enter the Asian market, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murdoch</ENAMEX> was able to build <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Star TV</ENAMEX> into the
dominant programming service.
<p>
   A spokeswoman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LaRae Marsik</ENAMEX>, said the
partners in the Latin American venture intended to begin service by
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of 1996</TIMEX>. When the companies announced their plans <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last
November</TIMEX>, they said they planned to be in business by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marsik</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications</ENAMEX> and its partners had a
back-up plan, which could include leasing space on another
satellite, but she declined to offer details. ``It is an
unfortunate incident,'' she said, ``but it is not a
make-it-or-break-it event for us.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica Reif</ENAMEX>, a media analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.</ENAMEX>, said, ``If
they can get up and running with exclusive programming <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">within six
months</TIMEX>, it doesn't set the venture back that far.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes Electronics</ENAMEX>, a subsidiary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX>, is
starting its own satellite broadcast service in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX>. Ms.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reif</ENAMEX> said that venture, which is based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DirecTV</ENAMEX> service
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>, would benefit if the explosion delayed the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murdoch</ENAMEX>-led venture.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bethesda</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Maryland</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb. 15</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comsat Corp.</ENAMEX> and the

launch attempt in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Instead, it reflects massive competitive changes that have taken
place in the satellite business -- particularly for the
long-distance telephone services -- in recent years, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comsat</ENAMEX>
officials said.
<p>
   ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelsat</ENAMEX> was derived <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 years ago</TIMEX> to provide service in a
monopoly environment,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Mattingly</ENAMEX>, vice president and
general manager for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comsat World Systems</ENAMEX>. ``There's no longer a
monopoly environment.''
<p>
   Competition from private satellite communications providers like
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greenwich</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Connecticut</ENAMEX> based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PanAmSat</ENAMEX> and fiber optic
telecommunications carriers ``is growing like gangbusters,''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mattingly</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   That cuts into the business <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelsat</ENAMEX> provides
to companies like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&AMP;T Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI Communications Corp.</ENAMEX>, which
use their satellites to route their overseas calls.
<p>
   For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comsat</ENAMEX>, which owns <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19 percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelsat</ENAMEX>, the preferred
solution is to divide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelsat</ENAMEX> into two separate entities. One
would have public shareholders, like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comsat</ENAMEX>, and would be
structured to compete in the satellite ``markets of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90's</TIMEX> and
beyond,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mattingly</ENAMEX> said. The remainder of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelsat</ENAMEX> would remain a
cooperative intergovernmental organization that would continue to
provide basic public network services.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s proposal could take years to be put in place. Even so,
shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comsat</ENAMEX> jumped 2 7/8 to close <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> at a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52-week</TIMEX> high of
25 3/8. The total of 1.6 million shares was almost seven times its
average daily volume for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last six months</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comsat</ENAMEX> plans to present the proposal to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelsat</ENAMEX>'s board of
governors in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mattingly</ENAMEX> said. If it wins approval from the
governors at its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 1997</TIMEX> meeting, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comsat</ENAMEX> would like to see it
implemented ``shortly thereafter,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mattingly</ENAMEX> said. An offering
could then take place at the earliest about a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year later</TIMEX>, he said.
<p>
   Still, ``there will be competing proposals'' from some of the
other 135 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelsat</ENAMEX> members, he said. ``We expect there to be a
couple of alternative approaches. What we have is not the end but
the beginning,'' he said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comsat</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelsat</ENAMEX> were both created in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1960s</TIMEX> when
satellites were first developed to carry telephone calls and
broadcast signals. No <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> government funds are invested in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comsat</ENAMEX>,
the company says, but reflective of its original sponsorship, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> president names three of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comsat</ENAMEX>'s 15 board members.
<p>
   In addition to its investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelsat</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comsat</ENAMEX> also owns the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denver Nuggets</ENAMEX> team in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Basketball Association</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   For now, though, the focus is how to handle the big changes
under way in how long-distance providers like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&AMP;T Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI
Communications Corp.</ENAMEX> route their calls overseas.
<p>
   Long distance phone companies have largely replaced their use of
satellites with fiber optic lines, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles DiSanza</ENAMEX>, analyst at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gerard Klauer Mattison</ENAMEX>. ``With all the fiber capacity, and with
renewed satellite competition, the industry is pretty much wide
open.'' Still, he said, ``you still need satellites to get places
where the lines aren't. When a call needs to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nigeria</ENAMEX>, it goes
via satellite.'' Other industry officials question why governments
should provide that service. ``The industry has changed so much
that it has become questionable to have a government-sponsored
entity performing these functions,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Alpert</ENAMEX>, former
senior officer at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comsat</ENAMEX> who now is president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alpert and
Associates</ENAMEX>, a communications consulting firm in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelsat</ENAMEX>'s assets, including satellites, would be divided almost
evenly between the existing organization and the new company,
according to the plan developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comsat</ENAMEX> in conjunction with a
task force of government officials from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX> departments and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Communications Commission</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Initially, the existing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelsat</ENAMEX> company would own all of the
stock of the new company, though the proposal calls for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 percent</NUMEX>
of the stock to be sold to investors within a year of the new
company's creation, with an additional <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 percent</NUMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next two
years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bethesda</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Maryland</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comsat</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mattingly</ENAMEX> said the sale of stock would be undertaken globally.
No underwriters have yet been suggested, he said.
<p>
   The proceeds from the public stock sales would be used to reduce
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelsat</ENAMEX>'s debt and improve its ability to provide global
communications, as well as provide working capital for the new
company.
<p>
   The new company would be publicly funded and free to purse other
market opportunities worldwide on a fully commercial and
competitive basis, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comsat</ENAMEX> said.

SHUTTLE MISSION TO PULL EUROPEAN SPACE EFFORT INTO SPOTLIGHT
(For use by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times News Service</ENAMEX> clients.)

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">CAPE CANAVERAL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>  &MD;  <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>'s budding human space program is
poised to step into the spotlight with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russia</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>, Italian astronauts <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maurizio Cheli</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Umberto
Guidoni</ENAMEX> are set to join veteran Swiss astronaut <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claude Nicollier</ENAMEX>
and four Americans aboard the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> shuttle Columbia to blast off on
a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two-week</TIMEX> mission.
<p>
   When the shuttle settles into orbit, there will be 12 astronauts
circling the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>  &MD;  the seven-person Columbia crew, four Russians
and German <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Reiter</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Two Russians and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reiter</ENAMEX> are aboard the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decade</TIMEX>-old Mir space
station. Two Russians are on a Soyuz capsule launched from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central
Asia</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early Wednesday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Columbia is to blast off from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kennedy Space Center</ENAMEX> during
a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 1/2 hour</TIMEX> period that begins at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3:18 p.m. EST</TIMEX>. Ideal weather
conditions were forecast.
<p>
   The shuttle crew plans experiments with a small Italian
satellite they will unreel to a distance of nearly 13 miles on a
thin tether. They hope to show that the tether will generate an
electrical current as it whips through the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>'s magnetic field.
<p>
   ``<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tomorrow</TIMEX>, 12 astronauts will be together in orbit  &MD;  four
Americans, four Russians and four Europeans,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean-Jaques Dordain</ENAMEX>
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Space Agency</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>. ``As you can see, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESA</ENAMEX>
is fully dedicated to manned space flight.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dordain</ENAMEX>, director of strategy, planning and international policy
for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESA</ENAMEX>, called the mission ``a new step toward the international
space station where the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> but also
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> will work as partners, paving the way toward the
international exploration missions of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21st century</TIMEX>.''
<p>
   Assembly of the station is to begin in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1997</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Few would argue that the 14-nation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Space Agency</ENAMEX> is near
parity with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russia</ENAMEX> in terms of space
exploration. But as the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next few weeks</TIMEX> may demonstrate, the
consortium plans to make significant gains by the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">end of the
millennium</TIMEX>, building on the experiences of its senior partners and
setting its own goals.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> watched from the sidelines in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1961</TIMEX>, when the former
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> lofted the first humans into
space. Later, Europeans watched as the two superpowers spent
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions</NUMEX> competing to explore the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">moon</ENAMEX>, loft space stations and
develop space shuttles.
<p>
   When Columbia lifts off, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheli</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guidoni</ENAMEX> will become the 23rd
and 24th Europeans to fly in space, compared to the 218 Americans
and 84 Russians who have flown. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicollier</ENAMEX> has flown twice
previously aboard the shuttle.
<p>
   In the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1970s</TIMEX>, he became the first <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESA</ENAMEX> astronaut to train
with the astronaut corps of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Aeronautics and Space
Administration</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reiter</ENAMEX> returns to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> with two Russians on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb. 29</TIMEX>, he
will have accumulated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">179 continuous days</TIMEX> in space, well below the
Russian record but far exceeding the American record of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">115 days</TIMEX>
established <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> by former <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> astronaut <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norm Thagard</ENAMEX> aboard
Mir.
<p>
   While flying as guest researchers aboard the spacecraft of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russia</ENAMEX>, the Europeans have been tentative about
investing in their own space programs, often heatedly debating
whether they could afford it.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESA</ENAMEX> developed the bus-sized Spacelab module that functions as
the laboratory in the cargo bay of the space shuttle.
<p>
   However, it was only <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last October</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESA</ENAMEX> ministers cemented
their commitment to proceed with the development of a similar
module for the planned international space station. Their lab will
join those contributed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russia</ENAMEX> for
long-term research in space.
<p>
   The Europeans also are planning an automated cargo module for
the space station and considering whether to develop a crew
transfer vehicle, their first spacecraft capable of launching
humans into orbit. Both would be launched by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ariane</ENAMEX> 5 rocket, a
powerful rocket the Europeans are developing initially for
commercial payloads.

COLUMBIA REACHES ORBIT SAFELY AFTER ENGINE SCARE
(For use by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times News Service</ENAMEX> clients.)

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">CAPE CANAVERAL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>  &MD;  The space shuttle Columbia thundered
safely into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> orbit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> with a multinational crew and an
Italian satellite, though two cockpit displays falsely signaled an
engine problem after liftoff.
<p>
   The shuttle soared from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kennedy Space Center</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3:18 p.m.
EST</TIMEX>, rising through hazy skies on an easterly course and settling
into a planned 184-mile-high orbit.
<p>
   The seven astronauts are prepared for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> in orbit. On
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> they will unreel a 1,500-pound, tethered satellite to a
distance of nearly 13 miles from Columbia on a matchstick-thin
cord.
<p>
   During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</TIMEX> of experiments, they hope to demonstrate that
the copper wire wrapped in high-strength synthetic insulation will
generate electricity as the two spacecraft whip through <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>'s
ionosphere and magnetic field.
<p>
   The same experiment faltered during a mission in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>, with the
satellite becoming stuck 850 feet from the shuttle during
deployment.
<p>
   Columbia's three main engines ignited precisely on schedule
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>, but within a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">few seconds</TIMEX> an amber ``alert'' light flashed
in front of commander <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Allen</ENAMEX> and pilot <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Horowitz</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX>
informed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mission Control</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX> that the left engine chamber
pressure was far lower than the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 percent to 104 percent</NUMEX> it was
supposed to register.
<p>
   ``We've got a gauge showing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45 percent</NUMEX> on the left,'' radioed
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Had the reading been accurate, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horowitz</ENAMEX> would have
faced a possible launch abort with an emergency landing at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kennedy Space Center</ENAMEX> or, perhaps, on emergency strips in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Spain</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``Columbia, we're showing good engines, good commands on all
three channels,'' responded <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blaine Hammond</ENAMEX>, the shuttle crew's
liaison in the control center.
<p>
   Similar readings at the launch control center at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kennedy</ENAMEX> also
showed the engines were working properly.
<p>
   ``Obviously, we will have to pore over the data,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loren
Shriver</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s mission management team chairman and a former
shuttle commander, told reporters later. ``But all the responses,
all the performances of the mission were right on the money.''
<p>
   Through the ascent, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> told controllers later, the left
engine chamber pressure reading in the cockpit indicated a
consistent deficiency of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 percent</NUMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shriver</ENAMEX> said engineers believe there may have been a problem in
the link between the shuttle's bank of general-purpose computers
and the left engine's computer.
<p>
   Columbia was graced with a smooth countdown and near-perfect
launch weather.
<p>
   ``From my crew, `arrivederchi, adieu, auf wideersehen and
adios,''' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> radioed the launch control team moments before
liftoff.
<p>
   The seven-man crew includes two Italians and a Swiss astronaut.
<p>
   A German astronaut and four Russian cosmonauts were also in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> orbit aboard a Russian Soyuz capsule and the Mir space
station <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> orbit was populated for the first time by
four Americans, four Europeans and four Russians.
<p>
   In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1997</TIMEX>, all three nations plan to join the Japanese and
Canadians in the assembly of a new global space station.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX>'s crew includes flight engineer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maurizio Cheli</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX>,
payload commander <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franklin Chang-Diaz</ENAMEX>, mission specialist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff
Hoffman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claude Nicollier</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Switzerland</ENAMEX> and payload specialist
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Umberto Guidoni</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX> as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Horowitz</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang-Diaz</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hoffman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicollier</ENAMEX> all flew on the first
tethered mission in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Aeronautics and Space
Administration</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Italian Space Agency</ENAMEX> have invested nearly
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$450 million</NUMEX> to develop and prepare the tether system for the two
test flights.
<p>
   Once the tethered satellite experiment is completed, the shuttle
astronauts will join teams of ground researchers for a series of
physics and biotechnology experiments. Researchers believe the work
could improve the production of computer chips and metal alloys as
well as aid the eventual development of antiviral drugs.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CHIRAC</ENAMEX> REAPS GLORY, AND GRUMBLING, ON FRENCH DEFENSE CUTBACKS
(HLW)
By <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CRAIG R. WHITNEY</ENAMEX>
c.<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N.Y. Times News Service</ENAMEX>
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">PARIS</ENAMEX>  &MD;  President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacques Chirac</ENAMEX>, denounced around the world
only <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month ago</TIMEX> for conducting underground nuclear weapons tests
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX>, reaped praise on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> for his decision to phase
out the land-based third of the French nuclear deterrent and to
stop all further production of weapons-grade fissionable material.
<p>
   But his plan to abolish conscription and to shrink the uniformed
military from 500,000 to 350,000 in an all-volunteer force <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six
years from now</TIMEX> met with mixed reactions, inside and outside the
ranks.
<p>
   In a television interview on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chirac</ENAMEX> said the
underground tests had proved that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> could rely on submarine-
and air-launched missiles for its nuclear deterrent from now on and
do away with all ground-launched ones.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chirac</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> was the first nuclear power to renounce
production of more fissile material to make nuclear warheads, and
that it would close down the plant at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pierrelatte</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rhone
Valley</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> established in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1960s</TIMEX>, over the
objections of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> and other nuclear powers, to
produce enriched uranium.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chirac</ENAMEX> also plans to close the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Pacific</ENAMEX> sites where the
last six tests were conducted.
<p>
   By phasing out 18 land-based medium-range missiles in
southeastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year and next</TIMEX> and dismantling 15
short-range missile launchers stored in eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> that had
long been a thorn in the side of relations with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chirac</ENAMEX>
took more tarnish off his image.
<p>
   Though he acknowledged that Chancellor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helmut Kohl</ENAMEX> would
probably regret the withdrawal of some of the 19,000 French troops
still stationed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chirac</ENAMEX> pledged to preserve the French
commitment to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eurocorps</ENAMEX>, a 50,000-man multinational unit that
both <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX> regard as the core of a strengthened
European defense. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kohl</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> expressed support for the French
decisions.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> diplomats said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chirac</ENAMEX>'s strategy was in line with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> alliance's moves in recent years to shift from big, heavily
armed units designed to repel a Soviet invasion toward smaller,
more mobile forces that could be sent quickly to trouble spots like
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bosnia</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   In the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next century</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chirac</ENAMEX> told a gathering of 500 senior
French officers and members of the enlisted ranks at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Military
School</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>'s nuclear deterrent would rest on
four new strategic missile submarines plus an undetermined number
of supersonic air-launched cruise missiles.
<p>
   Defense officials said that by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2015</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">army</ENAMEX> would consist of
136,000 soldiers, 100,000 fewer than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> of 45,500,
nearly 20,000 fewer, and an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">air force</ENAMEX> of 63,000 which would be
25,000 fewer.
<p>
   ``I expect unflinching commitment from you to this task of
reconsolidating our armed forces,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chirac</ENAMEX> told his troops. He
called for a national debate on doing away with conscription  &MD;  and
got one immediately.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean-Marie Le Pen</ENAMEX>, the leader of the extreme-right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National

ASTRONAUTS STRUGGLE WITH COMPUTER PROBLEMS

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">HOUSTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Columbia's astronauts prepared to unspool an Italian
tethered satellite <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> for a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two-day</TIMEX> test but fell <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">several hours</TIMEX>
behind schedule because of difficulties with computers needed to
control the experiment.
<p>
   Space agency officials, however, were hopeful the shuttle crew
would not have to delay deployment of the 1,500-pound satellite,
beginning shortly before <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 p.m. EST</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> The near <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six-hour</TIMEX>
operation would separate Columbia and the satellite on a
shoe-lace-thin, 13-mile-long cord.
<p>
   ``I'm at this point enthusiastic,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nobie Stone</ENAMEX>, chief
mission scientist for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Aeronautics and Space
Administration</ENAMEX>. ``I think we can solve the problems and go on with
the deployment mission as we had planned.''
<p>
   A team of Italian and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> researchers expect to demonstrate
that the long tether will generate an electrical current as the
crafts race through <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>'s ionosphere and magnetic field at
velocities of five miles per second.
<p>
   The computer trouble, which could hinder the crew's ability to
safely maneuver the satellite away from Columbia, caused the seven
astronauts to fall <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three hours</TIMEX> behind their timeline as they worked
around the clock in shifts. If the slide continues, mission
managers could postpone deployment until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The 12,000 pounds of gear required for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two-day</TIMEX> flight test
relies on the interactions of 18 computers.
<p>
   During checks <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>, a critical payload bay computer started,
faltered and restarted itself, interrupting the flow of commands
and science data it routes between the tether's complex deploy
mechanism, satellite experiment equipment and astronaut control
panels and displays.
<p>
   Additionally, a laptop computer used by the astronauts to
display data operated too sluggishly to be useful, and a sensor on
the deployer that clocks the speed and length of the tether
provided bad readings.
<p>
   Working with engineers on the ground, the astronauts operated
the payload processor in a backup mode that seemed to function
reliably and replaced the sluggish laptop and cabling with a spare.
But the sensor error, which indicated several yards of tether
deployment when there was none, proved more mysterious.
<p>
   ``These things happen to you sometimes,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Briscoe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s
mission operations director, said of the problems with equipment
that worked on the ground during pre-launch tests.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and Italian space agencies attempted the same tethered
satellite experiment in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> aboard the shuttle Atlantis, with
disappointing results. The deployer mechanism snagged on a safety
bolt, and the satellite never made it more than 850 feet from the
shuttle.
<p>
   Four of Columbia's astronauts flew on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> mission,
including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andy Allen</ENAMEX>, the mission commander. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Early Friday</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX>
took a call from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> Administrator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Goldin</ENAMEX>, who offered words
of encouragement and caution.
<p>
   ``Clearly, I want success, but the fact of the matter is, we
have to understand when you go into space, there is always a
risk,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldin</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX>. ``Safety is going to be the first
priority in operating the tether, right?''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> responded, ``There is no doubt in our minds we will be
able to keep the orbiter safe and the crew safe. That is the utmost
of our priorities.''
<p>
   Researchers believe tether systems could be used to generate
electrical power aboard a space station, maneuver spacecraft into
higher or lower orbits without rocket propulsion and lower probes
into regions of the atmosphere that cannot be studied with
conventional aircraft or satellites.
<p>
   On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>, propulsion system experts said they believe Columbia
may have experienced a pair of unrelated scares <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>, when the
astronauts blasted off. Moments into their ascent, a caution light
lit on a cockpit panel, and the gauge for the left main rocket
engine indicated it was significantly underpowered, a condition
that could have prompted an emergency landing.
<p>
   As it turned out, the propulsion system performed normally. Some
shuttle engineers believe Columbia's primary computers and a second
computer on the shuttle engines may have been slightly out of sync
in the relay of commands and responses, triggering the amber
caution light.
<p>
   But they may not know until Columbia returns to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> why the
cockpit gauge erroneously indicated at the same time that the left
engine was underpowered.

`SPY IN THE SKY': HOW SPY PLANE DELAYED ARMS CONTROL

<TEXT>
<p>
   Remember <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis Gary Powers</ENAMEX>? He became an incident in the cold
war on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1, 1960</TIMEX>, when his plane, the supersecret U-2, was shot
down over the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>. ``Spy in the Sky'' finds unexpected
ironies in the story of what he was doing up there.
<p>
   As explained here, President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dwight D. Eisenhower</ENAMEX> ordered the
building of a new spy plane because he doubted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> estimates
of Soviet bomber strength. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eisenhower</ENAMEX> never really trusted the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX>,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Welzenbach</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> historian. ``He always
thought they overstated their case.'' The new plane, the U-2, would
have the mission of confirming or rebutting the dire estimates.
<p>
   Building a craft that could fly high enough to evade Soviet
defenses was a considerable challenge. Much of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hourlong</TIMEX> program is
given to details of how that was accomplished.
<p>
   Not only could the lightweight U-2 fly high and travel far, but
it could also bring back excellent pictures, which in fact proved
that the Soviets did not have nearly the number of bombers the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air
Force</ENAMEX> had assumed: the bomber gap didn't exist.
<p>
   So from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>'s point of view, the U-2 was a peacekeeper,
making it unnecessary for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> to build more planes
than it needed, and thus holding down the arms race. Unfortunately,
the Soviets, who spotted the first U-2 to go over their territory
but were unable to get at it, did not see things that way. They
were waiting for a chance to shoot one down.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powers</ENAMEX>' mission was particularly chancy. In search of missile
bases, he had to fly thousands of miles across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> in
a straight line, which made him more vulnerable to Soviet
interception. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Welzenbach</ENAMEX> puts it, ``If you fly in a straight
line long enough, they're going to get you.''
<p>
   The fact that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powers</ENAMEX> U-2 was caught working on that favorite
Soviet holiday, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May Day</TIMEX>, added insult to injury at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kremlin</ENAMEX> just
as a big-power summit meeting approached. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nikita S. Khrushchev</ENAMEX>
denounced the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>, and the narrator adds, ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eisenhower</ENAMEX>'s
hopes for a test-ban treaty and for detente were shattered.''
<p>
   The program, an offering from ``The American Experience'' on
PBS, ends by noting that on the day that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powers</ENAMEX> was sentenced to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10
years</TIMEX> in prison (he would serve <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17 months</TIMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> received film
from its new spy satellite, which covered more territory than all
the U-2 flights put together.
<p>
   It showed that the supposed missile gap was no more real than
the supposed bomber gap. But the plane that had served to slow the
arms race had also delayed the move toward more peaceful relations.

MYSTERY SURROUNDING LOST SATELLITE THICKENS
(For use by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times News Service</ENAMEX> clients.)

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">HOUSTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> ground control teams stablished periodic radio
contact with the lost tethered satellite on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>, finding to
their surprise that its computer was dormant and its fuel tank
empty.
<p>
   Controllers successfully commanded the 1,500-pound satellite
into a ``safe'' mode  &MD;  a form of electronic hibernation  &MD;  moments
after the spacecraft and the more than 12 miles of shoe lace-thin
tether attached to it broke free of the shuttle Columbia on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>.
<p>
   When they lost contact 30 minutes after the snap, the computer
was on, the fuel tank filled with more than 90 pounds of nitrogen
gas and the valves that secure the propellant tank closed.
<p>
   The satellite's computer software was specifically compiled in
such a way that it could not command the opening and closing of the
fuel valves.
<p>
   Now, ground teams acknowledge, there are at least two mysteries
 &MD;  why the long tether snapped and how the satellite could have been
so radically altered.
<p>
   The space agency said its formal investigation into the
satellite loss will include the possibility of a connection between
all the events.
<p>
   ``It's a very interesting puzzle,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony LaVoie</ENAMEX>, the
satellite system's chief engineer. ``We're collecting data now on
the satellite and going over other data we have. We don't have all
the answers right now.'' About the only thing experts are willing
to rule out is extraterrestrial intervention.
<p>
   The purpose of the unusual experiment was to determine if long
space tethers could be controlled to generate an electrical current
while speeding through <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>'s ionosphere and magnetic field.
<p>
   Researchers said they saw more than the expected voltage across
the tether, a voltage surge on one satellite instrument and
high-energy electrons around the spacecraft before the break. The
current flow, however, had been intentionally interrupted by ground
commands several minutes before the break.
<p>
   Contact with the renegade satellite was first re-established
through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electronic Signal Test Laboratory</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson Space
Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX>. It sent commands that re-awakened the
spacecraft's scientific gear for electrical measurements and
reactivated gyroscopes for stability. All of that was possible
without the computer, which was on, when contact was lost <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The satellite and the mass of fabric tether suspended from it
are circling <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> in an egg-shaped orbit with high and low
altitudes of 254 and 195 miles. The satellite is expected to fall
and re-enter <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>'s atmosphere within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 to 30 days</TIMEX>, burning up
before it reaches the ground.
<p>
   ``I can't emphasize enough that the satellite and the tether is
a very unstable system,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Tracy</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> flight dynamics
officer following its movements.
<p>
   Its instability and mysterious behavior aside, the spacecraft
may get more attention before its suicide plunge. Some people on
the ground should be able to see it.
<p>
   One of the commands transmitted to the satellite <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> turned
on a set of flashing lights.
<p>
   ``It will be an absolutely awesome sight,'' astronaut <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff
Hoffman</ENAMEX> said of the opportunities to see the satellite from the
ground in parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northern Hemisphere</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</TIMEX>. ``It will be
the only time for ... people to see something in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> orbit that
is more than a point of light. They will see a line moving through
the sky.''
<p>
   Columbia commander <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andy Allen</ENAMEX> and his six-man crew could pass
within 60 to 70 miles of the spacecraft <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early Friday</TIMEX>, perhaps close
enough for them to get another look.

ELECTRON GUNS FIRED AT TETHERED SATELLITE IN ENERGY WAVE
EXPERIMENT
(For use by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times News Service</ENAMEX> clients.)

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">HOUSTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  The shuttle Columbia's astronauts fired electron guns
at the wandering Italian tethered satellite <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> as part of a
last-ditch experiment in electrodynamics.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Overnight</TIMEX>, the seven shuttle astronauts expected to close within
50 miles of the half-ton satellite and the thousands of feet of
tether massed around it  &MD;  the closest they will come before
Columbia's scheduled landing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next Thursday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The tether linking the shuttle to the satellite broke <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, flinging the smaller spacecraft into a much higher,
elliptical orbit.
<p>
   Columbia was to cross behind and below the satellite.
<p>
   Hours before the close approach, the astronauts periodically
fired the shuttle's electron guns into space in a range of
frequencies, so researchers could determine whether the pulses were
generating waves of energy and magnetism that could be detected by
the satellite's instruments.
<p>
   So far, the satellite has recorded waves generated by Columbia's
electron guns at a separation of more than 300 miles, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nobie Stone</ENAMEX>, the project's chief scientist.
<p>
   More shuttle pulses were planned during the fly-by to help
experts determine which electron gun frequencies were most
successful at generating the waves.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stone</ENAMEX> was hopeful the satellite's fading batteries would hold
out long enough to relay the results to the network of ground
stations hastily assembled after the tether break.
<p>
   Meanwhile, most of the shuttle crew's efforts were redirected
toward the mission's second major objective, research efforts to
exploit the weightlessness of space for the production of better
medicines, metal alloys and semiconductors.
<p>
   Among the experiments is a project proposed by Columbia
astronaut <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franklin Chang-Diaz</ENAMEX> to grow crystals of tripanothione
reductase, an enzyme involved in the spread of Chagas' disease.
<p>
   The disease, for which there is now no effective treatment, is
transmitted by a nocturnal insect and afflicts thousands of Central
and South Americans. It affects the muscles, including the heart,
and eventually causes death.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Delucas</ENAMEX>, the project's principal investigator, said
researchers hope to grow large, pure crystals of the enzyme aboard
the shuttle.
<p>
   Special X-ray techniques will be employed after the shuttle
returns to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> in a bid to develop a map of the enzyme's
molecular structure in unprecedented detail.
<p>
   An experiment team then plans to test natural extracts as
potential treatments for the disease. They would act by inhibiting
the enzyme and thus interrupting the life cycle of the parasite.
<p>
   ``It's a wonderful story,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Delucas</ENAMEX>. ``This is ... an area
where drug companies really don't want to work, because there is
not a lot of money in it for them.''
<p>
   Also <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>, Columbia commander <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andy Allen</ENAMEX> assisted
ground-based researchers with a series of combustion tests in which
silicon rubber and several types of insulated electrical wire were
ignited. The project is intended to assist engineers with the
development of a smoke detection system for the planned
international space station.
<p>
   At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">mid-day</TIMEX>, Columbia crewman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff Hoffman</ENAMEX> became the first
astronaut to log <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1,000 hours</TIMEX> of flight aboard a space shuttle.
<p>
   ``It sure has been fun getting here,'' said the veteran of five
missions and several space walks.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">HOUSTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> lost contact with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX>'s now powerless tethered
satellite on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>, just hours after the Columbia astronauts
managed to spot and photograph the gleaming spacecraft and the
miles of reflective cord suspended below.
<p>
   Final signals from the runaway spacecraft reached <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> stations
at about <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 a.m.</TIMEX> On a successive orbit over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> ground sites, the
satellite did not respond to electronic queries.
<p>
   Officials at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ENAMEX>
expect the satellite to plunge into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>'s atmosphere in about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two
weeks</TIMEX>, burning up before reaching the ground.
<p>
   ``The satellite is dead at this point,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nobie
Stone</ENAMEX>, the chief scientist for the project.
<p>
   Its battery power lasted longer than expected, permitting
researchers to communicate with the spacecraft during a close
approach <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late Thursday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``It's like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energizer</ENAMEX> bunny. It just kept on going,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stone</ENAMEX>
said.
<p>
   More than a dozen miles of fabric tether linking the half-ton
spacecraft to the shuttle snapped <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>. The satellite was
flung into a higher orbit, and plans for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</TIMEX> of linked
experiments in electromagnetism were interrupted after only <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few
hours</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Late Thursday</TIMEX>, the two spacecraft crossed within 53 miles of one
another. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> determined <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this week</TIMEX> it would have required
too much propellant for the shuttle to attempt an impromptu
rendezvous or retrieval.
<p>
   Nonetheless, the shuttle's communications gear was in contact
with the spacecraft for about <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">50 minutes</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late Thursday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The shuttle crew was moved by the eery beauty of the spacecraft
and surprised to find the tether hanging down from the satellite
rather than tangled around it.
<p>
   ``It was beautiful. It was like a comet,'' Columbia crewman
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Umberto Guidoni</ENAMEX>, a guest researcher from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Italian Space Agency</ENAMEX>,
told an Italian television interviewer on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX>, we've got contact. It's beautiful,'' Columbia
astronaut <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franklin Chang-Diaz</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mission Control</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson Space
Center</ENAMEX>, when the two spacecraft were separated by 93 miles. ``We
can see the tether.''
<p>
   ``The tether looked completely straight,'' astronaut <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff
Hoffman</ENAMEX> reported minutes later. ``I did not see anything above the
satellite.''
<p>
   The astronauts' first observation of the satellite occurred in
darkness and revealed only a bright light, when the two spacecraft
were 175 miles apart.
<p>
   Columbia's planned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14-day</TIMEX> flight is scheduled to end <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early
Thursday</TIMEX>, though mission managers are considering the possibility
of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one-day</TIMEX> extension.
<p>
   As tethered satellite activities waned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="week">during the week</TIMEX>, the
seven-man shuttle crew has been working around the clock in shifts
on 10 major laboratory experiments. The efforts are directed at
improving production techniques for metal alloys, semiconductors
and medicines for the treatment of viral diseases, cancer and
disorders of the immune system.
<p>
   The astronauts are also conducting experiments in combustion as
part of an effort to develop a fire detection system for the
planned international space station.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">CAMBRIDGE</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Netscape Communications</ENAMEX> rocketed out as
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>'s hottest initial public offering in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>, many companies
with Internet-related products have become darlings of Wall Street.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Open Market Inc.</ENAMEX>, an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18-month</TIMEX>-old software start-up, hopes it will
soon be its turn at bat.
<p>
   The company's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OM</ENAMEX>-Transact software allows merchants on the World
Wide Web to take orders, collect payment and fulfill the orders
without having to handle credit card transactions. Such services
can be contracted to banks or transaction-processing companies,
while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OM</ENAMEX>-Transact allows merchants to maintain customer profiles
and records of previous transactions.
<p>
   ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Open Market</ENAMEX> is saying they can get companies up to speed for
doing business-to-business transactions on the Web faster than
anybody else,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Logan</ENAMEX>, president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aberdeen Group</ENAMEX>, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX> consultant, who has tested the product. ``We believe they
can get a company up on the Web <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX> faster than anything
else out there. If they can execute flawlessly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="next year">over the next year</TIMEX>,
they could become an industry standard.''
<p>
   Analysts say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Open Market</ENAMEX> is likely to go public some time <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this
year</TIMEX>, and they expect the company to become one of the hottest
initial public offerings of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Judson</ENAMEX>, general manager of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Inc.</ENAMEX>'s new-media division,
one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Open Market</ENAMEX>'s first customers and an investor in the
company, said its software had the ``ability to create an easy and
secure transaction capability that was scalable and that could work
with any browser.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Open Market</ENAMEX> will be competing with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Netscape</ENAMEX>'s I-Store and
Merchant Server of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>. Besides <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Open Market</ENAMEX> has
signed several big customers including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banc One</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Union Bank</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett-Packard</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital Equipment Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>, the
financial publisher.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner</ENAMEX> has been offering electronic versions of Time,
People, Sports Illustrated, Money and other publications free on
its Pathfinder Web site. The company plans to start charging fees
for some products and services <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later this year</TIMEX>.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 5</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> will start a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX> of surface-to-surface missile tests in waters north and south
of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>, the official <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xinhua</ENAMEX> reported.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>'s main stock index fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.6 percent</NUMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">first 5
minutes</TIMEX> of trading. ``Stocks will react poorly to the news,'' said
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alex Lee</ENAMEX>, head of institutional sales at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yuanta Securities</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Broadcasting Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> said the tests would be as
close as 12 miles from the northeastern part of the island.
<p>
   A <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> Administration official downplayed the test, saying
they were expected.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> has conducted the tests <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="last summer">since last summer</TIMEX> in a warning
to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> that it opposes the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Tung-hui</ENAMEX>'s
efforts to increase the island's international recognition.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX> formally started his re-election campaign prior
to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>'s first direct presidential election on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 23</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The increased tension caused <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>'s stock market to plunge,
making it the world's worst performing market in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> Administration official, who spoke on the condition
of anonymity, said the tests announced <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> were
an expected continuation of previous tests that had been delayed by
bad weather.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xinhua</ENAMEX> report called for ships and aircraft to avoid the
areas in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South China Sea</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East China Sea</ENAMEX> where it will
conduct the test.
<p>
   ``For the sake of safety, the Chinese government requests the
governments of relevant countries and the authorities of relevant
regions to notify ships and aircraft of their countries and regions
not to enter the said sea areas and air spaces during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this
period</TIMEX>,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xinhua</ENAMEX> said.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> PROBING SINGED O-RINGS, PROCEEDING WITH MIR MISSION PLANS

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">HOUSTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> is proceeding with plans for a shuttle mission to
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russia</ENAMEX>'s Mir space station <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later this month</TIMEX>, even though engineers
are investigating singe marks on O-ring seals in rocket boosters
used to launch Columbia on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb. 22</TIMEX>, officials said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Atlantis is to blast off on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine-day</TIMEX> mission to Mir on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March
21</TIMEX>. Its crew includes veteran astronaut <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shannon Lucid</ENAMEX>, who will
remain aboard the Russian outpost until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Shuttle managers are to meet <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> for a major review of
mission plans before confirming their launch plans.
<p>
   One propulsion expert, who serves on an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> safety
panel, said Columbia's O-ring problem may stem from assembly rather
than a more serious design flaw, such as the one that triggered the
fatal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX> Challenger accident.
<p>
   ``My immediate suspicion would be there was something different
in the manufacturing or assembly (of Columbia's boosters),'' said
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seymour Himmel</ENAMEX>, a member of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The 15-story booster motors are comprised of four major
segments, a nozzle assembly and nose cap, all bolted together at
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kennedy Space Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> prior to launching.
<p>
   ``It's a job that requires a bit of experience and skill, and
I'd be suspicious when I find two of these things and wonder if
something happened with a tool that wasn't quite right or a
procedure that wasn't followed precisely,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Himmel</ENAMEX> said of the
singed O-rings.
<p>
   After Columbia's reusable booster motors were recovered from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic Ocean</ENAMEX> and taken apart, engineers found singe marks on
O-rings taken from the case-to-nozzle joint of both the left and
right solid-fuel rockets.
<p>
   The singed rubber O-rings were not designed to act as a thermal
or pressure barrier. Instead, their purpose is to keep adhesive
from getting to primary and backup pressure seals during assembly.
<p>
   While shuttle engineers have found similar damage to ``wiper''
O-rings nine previous times since the Challenger tragedy,
Columbia's was the first case with multiple burn damage in two
boosters from the same launch.
<p>
   ``That in itself is something I'd call a different situation.
Therefore, it's a reason to require deep investigation,'' said
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Himmel</ENAMEX>, a former propulsion engineer for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Aeronautics
and Space Administration</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   He said, however, that it is reasonable for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> to search for
an explanation while preparing Atlantis for launch.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last summer</TIMEX>, singe marks were found on a different O-ring
component in the nozzles taken from two back-to-back shuttle
missions. Engineers traced the cause to a subtle change in assembly
techniques and delayed a third shuttle flight for more than a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">month</TIMEX>
while repairs were made.
<p>
   Meanwhile, Columbia's crew caught another fleeting glimpse of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX>'s runaway tethered satellite <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>, as the two spacecraft
crossed paths high over the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific Ocean</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The shuttle crew managed a similar observation of the Italian
satellite <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late last week</TIMEX>. The satellite and more than 12 miles of
tether linking it to Columbia snapped on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb. 25</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Columbia's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15-day</TIMEX> research flight is scheduled to end <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early
Friday</TIMEX>, though mission managers might consider extending the flight
until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 7</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI Communications Corp.</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX> said they will pay <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loral Corp.</ENAMEX> more than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$400 million</NUMEX> to
build two satellites for a direct television broadcasting venture.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loral</ENAMEX> said it will launch the first satellite <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late next year</TIMEX> and
the second in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> said it expects to offer satellite
television in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> by the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">end of 1997</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loral</ENAMEX> contract raises the stakes in negotiations between
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rupert Murdoch</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications Inc.</ENAMEX>
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Malone</ENAMEX> on having the cable-TV giant join the
venture. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications</ENAMEX> owns two satellites it's not using
after the company lost a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX> auction for satellite broadcast
licenses to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loral</ENAMEX> satellites provide the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX> venture with new
leverage in the negotiations, analysts said. ``Any tactic they can
use to get <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications</ENAMEX> to work with them would make sense
because they want to get the satellites up as quick as they can,''
said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Connie Luecke</ENAMEX>, analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duff &AMP; Phelps Corp.</ENAMEX>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications</ENAMEX> has that ace in the hole: Its satellites can
be launched <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCI</ENAMEX> satellites are almost ready and could be launched in
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fall</TIMEX>,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Mayer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> senior vice president for
ventures and alliances. ``If it were possible to negotiate a deal
with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malone</ENAMEX>, then we could use one or more of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCI</ENAMEX> satellites
and deploy the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loral</ENAMEX> satellites elsewhere in the global system.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCI</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> venture isn't the only option for
entering the high-powered satellite television market. ``We're
looking at several different ways to enter the market,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCI</ENAMEX>
spokeswoman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LaRae Marsik</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The nation's largest cable operator owns part of the satellites
controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Echostar Communications Corp.</ENAMEX> and is a partner in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Primestar Partners</ENAMEX>, a satellite cable venture between six cable
companies. It could use one or both as a base for a satellite
television business.
<p>
   Satellite Business News, a trade magazine, reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCI</ENAMEX> is
negotiating to sell its two satellites to Canadian satellite
company <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telesat Canada</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCI</ENAMEX> would then lease back 27 to 28
transponders for television transmission.
<p>
   The venture companies and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications</ENAMEX> are eager to get
rolling in the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5 billion</NUMEX> satellite TV business, which is expected
to expand by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70 percent</NUMEX> annually from 5.5 million subscribers
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, according to Sky Report, a trade publication.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DirecTV</ENAMEX>, the leading satellite broadcast company, started in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1994</TIMEX> as a way for rural residents to receive cable-like
programming by satellite and quickly became popular in urban areas
too.
<p>
   Direct broadcast is received by 18-inch satellite dishes, which
have become one of the fastest-growing consumer electronics
products. Subscribers typically pay about <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$30</NUMEX> a month to get as
many as 175 channels of movies, sports and other programs.
<p>
   Consumers sign up for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DirecTV</ENAMEX> service in consumer electronics
stores when they buy the dish and receiver box needed to get the
programs on their television. The 18-inch dish and receiver cost
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$600 to $900</NUMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomberg Information Television</ENAMEX>, an affiliate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomberg
Business News</ENAMEX>, broadcasts on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DirecTV</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX> won the rights to operate a nationwide broadcast
satellite by bidding <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$682.6 million</NUMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Communications
Commission</ENAMEX> auction. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX> said at the time that they
intended to offer a package of video, audio, information and
entertainment services to businesses and consumers in all 50 states
and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``The signing of this (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loral</ENAMEX>) contract puts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX>
right on target in our plans to bring a unique blend of new
high-powered, digital satellite services to all our customers,''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bert Roberts</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> chairman and chief executive, said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
<p>

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> fired surface-to-surface missiles off the
coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>, drawing a swift denunciation from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> of the ``provocative and restless'' action.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> denounced the firings minutes after <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>
reported that Chinese naval forces off the coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> had
fired two missiles, one to the north of the island, another to the
southwest.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> described the firings as tests. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>
called them intimidation.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> had urged against the missile firings,
describing them as ``destabilizing'' and warning that although
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> claimed not to be aiming at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>, the accuracy of the
missiles was open to question.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">US</ENAMEX> intelligence sources said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> that the missile firings
are part of a series of Chinese maneuvers that have included 500
sorties by Chinese combat aircraft <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="last Friday">since last Friday</TIMEX> and a large
amphibious assault exercise around <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Haitan island</ENAMEX>, due west of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>'s northern tip.
<p>
   The missile tests are the most recent in a series of disputes
and disagreements that have in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few days</TIMEX> opened up deep
fissures in the carefully maintained facade of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">US</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> relations.
<p>
   They follow harsh exchanges between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> over
human rights, persistent <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">US</ENAMEX> warnings that missile tests were
irresponsible and renewed expressions of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">US</ENAMEX> unhappiness with
Chinese arms sales to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pakistan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Few analysts believe <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> has either the capacity or the desire
to invade <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>, but no one doubts that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> could inflict
serious damage on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>'s economy with a campaign of long-term,
low-grade military pressure.
<p>
   The missile firings and other menacing military activity come
just two weeks before general elections in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> maintains
that the elections  &MD;  whose multiparty nature is probably an
embarrassment to Communist-ruled <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX>  &MD;  are a sign that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>
is proceeding apace with its plans to declare its total
independence from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>. Since Nationalist Chinese forces retreated
to the island in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1949</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> has insisted that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> is simply a
temporarily province area that, like <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Macao</ENAMEX>, will soon
return to mainland rule.
<p>
   Analysts in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> have suggested that the tests are a
tactic devised to engineer the greatest possible destabilization of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> while incurring the least possible risk for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX>. The
mere expectation of tests has affected the Taiwanese stock market,
they said.
<p>
   One Chinese missile landing on Taiwanese territory, even without
any human casualties, could ``crash the market,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stanley Roth</ENAMEX>
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Institute for Peace</ENAMEX>. ``This could be a very clever
scenario.''
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Earlier Thursday</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" MIN="Foreign Ministry">Chinese Foreign Ministry</ENAMEX> spokesman rejected
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">US</ENAMEX> expressions of concern about the impending tests. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> will
never accept the representations and protests from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">US</ENAMEX> side on
this issue,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shen Guofeng</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shen</ENAMEX> also told the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> to keep its views on human
rights in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> to itself. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> report <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> had
complained of a growing number of human rights abuses in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>. The
Chinese spokesman shrugged these off. ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> does not
have the right to make irresponsible remarks on the internal
affairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> or any other country,'' he said.
<p>
   In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, as a senior Chinese national security official
arrived for meetings with his counterparts, administration
officials again voiced concern about <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s arms transfers to
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pakistan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The latest exchange of verbal blows underlines the difficulties
facing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">US</ENAMEX> policy makers in their dealings with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> is gradually turning into a major power, one whose economy
is expected to outstrip <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early decades of the next
century</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s third largest investor, with
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$26 billion</NUMEX> in the country  &MD;  coming ironically, just after <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong
Kong</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> wants good relations with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX>, but
admits it has no idea which path <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> will take  &MD;  a recognizable
form of democracy, a strengthening of its present authoritarian
regime, or something in between.
<p>
   At the moment, with its still secretive leadership involved in
their own version of elections, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> is showing its uncompromising
face to the world. The pivotal and preeminent figure in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s
post-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mao</ENAMEX> economic moderninzation, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deng Xiaoping</ENAMEX>, is quietly dying.
<p>
   Other top leaders are maneuvering to take over. None has the
power to secure it without a struggle. And none of the claimants,
analysts here say, wants to be seen as weak in the face of
perceived insubordination by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> or disapproval from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>.

<p>
   On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>, even before any missiles were fired, many banks
were experiencing heavy buying of American dollars, according to
local newspaper reports. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of Taiwan</ENAMEX>, according to The China
News, doubled its weekly purchases of American dollars and several
banks placed limits on their purchase.
<p>
   The New Taiwan dollar was hit hard by heavy selling and lost
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">three cents</NUMEX>, a further fall prevented only by the intervention of
the island's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Bank</ENAMEX>. The stock market, which was rocked
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this week</TIMEX>, recovered strongly on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>, with government
buying largely contributing to the markets strength.
<p>
   Despite pleas for calm, rumors coursed through the capital. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Institute</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>, the private non-government agency
that serves as the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> embassy here, denied repeated rumors that
it was preparing for the evacuation of American citizens.
<p>
   Gold dealers were reporting that the sale of gold bars, a
traditional haven for Chinese in times of trouble, were running <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20
to 30 percent</NUMEX> above normal.
<p>
   In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> was ``deeply disturbed,'' said
its spokesman, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael D. McCurry</ENAMEX>. He said the national security
adviser, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Lake</ENAMEX>, would meet on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> with his Chinese
counterpart, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liu Huaqiu</ENAMEX>, a vice foreign minister, to talk over the
sharply elevated tensions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan Strait</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Hours after the tests, Secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren Christopher</ENAMEX>
sought to ``get a dialogue going'' over dinner with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liu</ENAMEX>, who was on
a private visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lui</ENAMEX>, like other Chinese
diplomats, was not listening very closely on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> to American
concerns about human rights, trade deficits, copyright violations
and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX>'s sales of missiles and nuclear-weapons technology.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liu</ENAMEX> wanted most of all to air <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s grievances over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>,
officials said. Chinese officials openly expressed fury on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>
over democratic elections to be held in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> and the
refusal of Taiwanese leaders to discuss reunification with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>.
They also lashed out at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX>'s criticism on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX>'s human rights record, and restated their
anger at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>' decision <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> to grant a visa to
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>'s president, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Teng-hui</ENAMEX>, so he could attend a reunion at
his alma mater, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cornell University</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last June</TIMEX>.
<p>
   A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> official stressed that the missile tests were
not acts of war or terror. As long as the missiles keep falling in
the target areas, and do not strike <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>, the tests are no more
than political theater  &MD;  ``but a little too close to the edge of
the stage,'' he said.
<p>
   ``The view here is that these tests, while clearly meant to make
a political impact, do not constitute an economic blockade, or an
attempt to mess <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> up commercially or economically,'' he said.

DEFENSE COMPANIES PROFIT MACHINES EVEN AS MILITARY BUDGET FALLS
(For use by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times News Service</ENAMEX> clients)
By <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jenell Wallace</ENAMEX>
c.<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomberg Business News</ENAMEX>

<TEXT>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 4</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> defense companies are
winners these days, even as military spending shrinks.
<p>
   The nation's airplane and weapons makers turned big profits in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>, boosting returns for investors as well. No. 2 defense
contractor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonnell Douglas Corp.</ENAMEX>, for example, reported operating
profit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$905 million</NUMEX> in its military business, up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28 percent</NUMEX> from
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">previous year</TIMEX>. Its stock rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">94 percent</NUMEX>.
<p>
   The gains reflect a shift in the way <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonnell Douglas</ENAMEX> designs
and builds products. Take the upgraded F/A-18 Hornet, a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>
strike fighter that will cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$89 billion</NUMEX> -- the single most
expensive program planned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> -- if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> buys 1,000
of the planes over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two decades</TIMEX>. Its nose barrel is made with one
piece of sheet metal rather than 90 as required for its
predecessor, saving <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3,746</NUMEX> per aircraft and eliminating a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20-day</TIMEX>
cycle for subassembly.
<p>
   ``The industry is just simply working smarter,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard
Bitzinger</ENAMEX>, defense industry analyst at the nonprofit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center for
Strategic and Budgetary Assessments</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Add to that mergers and acquisitions in the defense industry
that have helped cut costs -- at the price of firing 1.33 million
workers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1987 and 1995</TIMEX> -- and defense companies are sitting
pretty. This is evident in the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">66 percent</NUMEX> gain posted by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard &AMP; Poor's</ENAMEX> aerospace and defense index since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan. 3, 1995</TIMEX>.
The broader market as represented by the S&AMP;P 500 rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 percent</NUMEX>.
<p>
   The defense industry ``has become enormously profitable over the
course of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last four years</TIMEX>,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BT Securities</ENAMEX> analyst
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolfgang Demisch</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Part of the profit growth stems from sheer size as companies
merge or acquire particular products to dominate certain types of
defense work. As a result, President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal 1997</TIMEX>
military budget request allocates roughly <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 percent</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$73.6
billion</NUMEX> in it for weapons to just five contractors.
<p>
   Consider No. 1 contractor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed Martin Corp.</ENAMEX>, one of the
principal military aircraft manufacturers along with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonnell
Douglas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northrop Grumman Corp.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bethesda</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Maryland</ENAMEX>-based
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed Martin</ENAMEX> -- created in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> when then-No. 2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed Corp.</ENAMEX>
acquired No. 3 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martin Marietta Corp.</ENAMEX> -- plans to bolster its
defense electronics business by acquiring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loral Corp.</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$9.1
billion</NUMEX>.
<p>
   Under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s request, funding for just two <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loral</ENAMEX> programs,
the multiple launch rocket system and a tactical missile system,
would amount to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$225 million</NUMEX>. These programs would boost government
revenue at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed Martin</ENAMEX>, in addition to the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4.46 billion</NUMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> seeks for its major programs such as the F-16 fighter.
<p>
   ``As companies merge, the defense industrial base is getting
more profitable,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bitzinger</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes Electronics Corp.</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX>, is
another case study in contractor dominance: It makes systems for
virtually every <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> military plane. Profit in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes</ENAMEX>'s aerospace
and defense segment <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> rose to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$688 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$664
million</NUMEX>, even as revenue slipped to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5.95 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$6.02
billion</NUMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes</ENAMEX> makes radar for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonnell Douglas</ENAMEX>'s F-15, FA-18 and AV-8
Harrier fighters, for example, as well as systems for the Bradley
Fighting Vehicle, an armored vehicle smaller than a tank
manufactured by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Defense LP</ENAMEX>, a partnership of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harsco Corp.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FMC Corp.</ENAMEX>
<p>
   In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes</ENAMEX> is involved in anything to do with missile
defense, said a defense industry official close to the budget
process.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> proposes <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$133.2 million</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> satellite
communications system and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$187.2 million</NUMEX> for 170 Advanced Medium
Range Air to Air Missiles (AAMRAMs), along with funding for other
programs at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>-based contractor.
<p>
   The president's proposal for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2.3 billion</NUMEX> for eight of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonnell
Douglas</ENAMEX>'s C-17 military transport plane illustrates another change
in the defense industry: willingness to rethink the way it builds
weapons.
<p>
   In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, the C-17 program was months behind schedule, about <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1
billion</NUMEX> over budget, and plagued by software, avionics and wing
problems. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonnell Douglas</ENAMEX> and the government, which kept revising
production specifications and performance requirements, shared
blame. The C-17s future was in jeopardy.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonnell Douglas</ENAMEX> responded by paying closer attention to costs.
Employees devised a different way to use scaffolding in building
the plane, a simple change that saved about <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$90,000</NUMEX> per aircraft,
for example.
<p>
   Such efforts and better communication with the government helped
the C-17 program get back on track. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last summer</TIMEX>, C-17s took off as
scheduled <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99 percent</NUMEX> of the time in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> reliabliblity tests.
The plane received the prestigious Collier Trophy from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National
Aeronautic Association</ENAMEX> for ``the greatest achievement in
aeronautics.''
<p>
   The government, which already spent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$13 billion</NUMEX> for 40 C-17s,
plans to 80 more for about <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$18 billion</NUMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next few years</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal 1997</TIMEX> request also includes <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2.6 billion</NUMEX> for the
advanced F/A-18 and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$398 million</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonnell Douglas</ENAMEX>'s Longbow
Apache helicopter.

CHINESE MISSILE TESTING FAILS TO DISRUPT LIFE ON <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">TAIWAN</ENAMEX>

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">KEELUNG</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Not long after three unarmed Chinese missiles
fell near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>'s shores, unsubtle weapons in a campaign of
intimidation, leaders here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> made the expected calls for calm
and vowed to repel any attacks.
<p>
   But among the people of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>, long accustomed to living in the
shadow of a hostile giant, only sporadic signs of anxiety
punctuated a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> that differed little from any other. Traffic jams
clotted <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taipei</ENAMEX>'s streets, with motor scooters weaving madly between
honking taxis, lumbering buses and streams of delivery trucks. And
the campaign for the presidency, at the forefront of many people's
concerns, continued its furious pace.
<p>
   Typical was the response of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wang Chi-san</ENAMEX>, a dock worker at this
cargo and fishing port on the northern tip of the island. As a
crane swung a rope sling piled with crates of brain-numbing
kaoliang alcohol onto a truck at dockside here, he broke into a

   ``Eeverybody's a little worried,'' he said, ``but really,
there's no reason to be afraid. No reason at all.''
<p>
   Only <TIMEX TYPE="TIME" MIN="12 hours">12 hours before</TIMEX>, an unarmed Chinese M-9 ballistic missile
had slammed into the sea barely <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three hours</TIMEX>' sail north of this
port, marking the onset of a new Chinese campaign to intimidate
this island of 21 million people as it edges toward its first
presidential election in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX>.
<p>
   In the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">predawn hours</TIMEX>, two other missiles crashed into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South
China Sea</ENAMEX> west of one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>'s major container ports at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kaohsiung</ENAMEX>.
It was the closest Chinese missiles, armed or unarmed, have come to
this island in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57 years</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="TIME" MIN="day">Throughout the day</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> kept up a rattle of bellicose
statements, with Foreign Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qian Qichen</ENAMEX> warning <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> that
``a real disaster'' would befall <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> if it persisted in its
quest for independence.
<p>
   As <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dawn</TIMEX>'s glow nibbled at the darkness, President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Teng-hui</ENAMEX>
was out in the street markets of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taipei</ENAMEX> campaigning and chatting
with shoppers. Huge crowds cheered his arrival, but he refrained
from commenting on the missile tests.
<p>
   A spokesman for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foreign Ministry</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Chen</ENAMEX>, said that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> preferred to let other government organs speak on the issue.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kao Koo-liang</ENAMEX>, the vice chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mainland Affairs
Council</ENAMEX>, accused <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> of trying to intimidate <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>'s people as
they prepare to vote for in the island's first presidential
elections.
<p>
   And despite mounting threats from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> about <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>'s efforts
to elevate its posture internationally, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kao</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> was
fully prepared to defeat a military assault by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``We will respond to this unreasonable provocation with reason
and self-restraint,'' he said. ``but we are thoroughly prepared to
deal with an armed invasion from the mainland.''
<p>
   ``As long as we can consolidate our psychological defenses,
unite together and remain steadfastly determined in our pursuit of
freedom and democracy, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> will fail in its attempt at armed
intimidation.''
<p>
   As if to emphasize this confidence, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taipei</ENAMEX> stock market
soared more than 54 points, raising the index <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.14 percent</NUMEX> to
4,805.09, a sharp reversal from the panicky sell-offs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this
week</TIMEX>.
<p>
   At the same time though, local banks continued to report runs on
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">American dollars</NUMEX>, with many banks running out of greenbacks as the
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">day</TIMEX> wore on. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of America</ENAMEX> announced that it would fly in a
plane loaded with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> currency <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> to cope with the demand.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>'s television channels hurtled back and forth between soap
operas, celebrity cooking contests and blanket coverage of the
missile tests. Boats chugged out into the mist with
miserable-looking correspondents peering into the brume.
<p>
   Reporters hovered around radar screens in air traffic control
terminals, the screens glowing with red boxes marking the air
exclusion zone declared by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>. And passengers and pilots were
buttonholed to see how they felt about the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five-minute</TIMEX> delay of
their flights.
<p>
   Yet, even as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> seemed bent on cowing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> into some sort
of submission, submission leading to reunification with the
mainland, the missile tests appeared to be having an opposite
effect.
<p>
   ``Generally speaking, people are maintaining calm,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew
Nien-tsu Yang</ENAMEX>, the secretary general of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese Council of
Advanced Policy Studies</ENAMEX>, a research body in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taipei</ENAMEX>. ``But there's a
lot of discussion about the missiles.''

missile near southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>, the fourth in a series of launchings
that began on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 8</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Ministry</ENAMEX> said in a

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">CARACAS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Venezuela</ENAMEX>  &MD;  <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> will seek advanced weapons and
related assistance from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</TIMEX>, amid ongoing
Chinese military exercises that have sparked alarm in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taipei</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Perry</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   He also said a second group of American warships is steaming
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian Gulf</ENAMEX> toward <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>, where it will join a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
aircraft carrier and battle support ships already patrolling waters
east of the island.
<p>
   Talks between senior diplomats and defense officials from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> begin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>. They were
scheduled months before the exercises <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> has been conducting
near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past week</TIMEX>. Similar talks are held <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> invariably seeks additional weaponry and advanced
defense gear, citing the threat of military action from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>,
which regards <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> as a renegade province.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This year</TIMEX>, however, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> has buttressed <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>'s position by
test firing Scud-like missiles  &MD;  four in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past week</TIMEX>  &MD;  to ocean
target areas as close as 20 miles from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>'s coast and by
staging live-fire exercises from ships and warplanes in the
140-mile-wide <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan Strait</ENAMEX> that divides <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Those activities, which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> has decried as
``provocative'' and ``reckless,'' have unnerved Taiwanese, who are
sure to use the incident to press their requests for sales of
American missile defense systems, submarines and other military
gear.
<p>
   ``It's quite clear that the Taiwanese are going to come in with
increased concern and increased anxiety, which will lead them to be
requesting more support than we might have expected in the past,''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perry</ENAMEX> said in an interview with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cox Newspapers</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``That's almost a predictable consequence of this,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perry</ENAMEX>,
who is here on the last leg of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="week">week-long</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX> trip.
``The Chinese government is trying to raise the anxiety level in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>. They will probably succeed in doing that.''
<p>
   On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> announced the award of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.15 billion</NUMEX>
to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed Martin Corp.</ENAMEX> in a deal to provide 150 F-16 fighter jets
to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>. The first of the jets are to be delivered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-1997</TIMEX>
under a previously awarded contract to help democratic <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>
upgrade its defenses.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> also is seeking the purchase <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>-made Harpoon
ship-killer missiles and Patriot antimissile batteries.
<p>
   Also on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>'s wish list is an antimissile defense umbrella
called ``theatre missile defense'' that would combine precision
radar, powerful computers and high-speed rockets to defend against
incoming missiles.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> government has tried to limit weapons sales to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>
to avoid provoking <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX>'s activities in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan
Strait</ENAMEX>, however, appear to add weight to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>'s request for more
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> weaponry.
<p>
   ``As of right now, the Chinese have made the case for the
Taiwanese,'' said former <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> diplomat <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John J. Tkacik Jr.</ENAMEX>,
president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China Business Intelligence</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alexandria</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Va.</ENAMEX>

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">CAPE CANAVERAL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>  &MD;  For the third time in less than a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>,
the space shuttle Atlantis is set for launching toward a linkup
with the Russian space station Mir, another rehearsal for the
assembly and operation of an international space station <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later in
the decade</TIMEX>.
<p>
   But this is the first time the shuttle is to leave behind an
American astronaut. That astronaut, Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shannon Lucid</ENAMEX>, is to live
on Mir for nearly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five months</TIMEX>. She is to be followed on Mir by at
least four other Americans on a rotating basis <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="spring of 1998">through the spring
of 1998</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Countdown preparations were proceeding smoothly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> for a
launching <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early Thursday</TIMEX>. Liftoff is scheduled for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3:35 a.m.</TIMEX>
<p>
   Officials at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kennedy Space Center</ENAMEX> have been watching the
weather closely, and the prospects are not favorable. High winds,
whipping through the region, are expected to continue through
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">launching time</TIMEX>. Meteorologists said there was an <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 percent</NUMEX> chance
that weather would be unacceptable for a liftoff.
<p>
   If the launching has to be postponed, officials would try again
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early Friday</TIMEX>, when the winds are supposed to have died down.
<p>
   Once off the ground, the crew of six astronauts is to steer the
Atlantis to a rendezvous and docking with Mir <TIMEX TYPE="TIME" MIN="43 hours">within 43 hours</TIMEX>  &MD;  on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>, if the launching is not delayed. The shuttle is bringing
new scientific equipment and supplies to Mir, which has been in
orbit more than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The two craft are to remain attached for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five days</TIMEX> of joint
experiments and tests of procedures for assembling the
international space station, which is being developed under the
leadership of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> but with participation by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russia</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Space Agency</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="sixth day">the sixth day of the flight</TIMEX>, two American astronauts  &MD;  Dr.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Godwin</ENAMEX>, a physicist, and Lt. Col. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. Richard Clifford</ENAMEX> of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX>  &MD;  are scheduled take a spacewalk to attach four experiments to
the outside of Mir. The experiments will investigate the space
environment in that particular orbit, which is the same one that
the international space station will travel.
<p>
   It will be the first spacewalk by American astronauts while the
shuttle is docked to Mir.
<p>
   After a flight of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine days</TIMEX>, the Atlantis is scheduled to land
at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cape Canaveral</ENAMEX>, with a crew of only five. Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucid</ENAMEX>, a
biochemist who has been on four previous shuttle missions, is to
remain with the two Russian astronauts on the orbiting station
until the next visit by Atlantis, scheduled for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early August</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The mission commander is Col. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin Chilton</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX>.
Other crew members are Lt. Col. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Searfoss</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX>
and Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Sega</ENAMEX>, an electrical engineer. The Russian astronauts
on Mir are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yuri Onufrienko</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yuri Usachev</ENAMEX>, who have been aboard
the space station for a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">month</TIMEX>.

<p>
   Regulators had few comments concerning alleged antitrust
violations by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMSC</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``We received a complaint recently and we'll evaluate any
additional information given to us,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gina Talamona</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice
Department</ENAMEX> spokeswoman.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Olson</ENAMEX>, chief of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX>'s competition division, said the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> can file a notice with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX>, just like any
other third party.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noreen</ENAMEX>, who formerly was an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMSC</ENAMEX> director and whose former
company was a member of the consortium, had sought to use
one-seventh of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMSC</ENAMEX>'s satellite capacity.
<p>
   ``I wrote a proposal to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMSC</ENAMEX>, but they never responded with a
formal agreement for satellite capacity,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noreen</ENAMEX> said. ``I made
continual requests for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</TIMEX>.''
<p>
   He noted he heard several reasons for the delay, ranging from
some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMSC</ENAMEX>'s major shareholders and consortium participants
wanting to offer services that would compete with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RadioSat</ENAMEX>, to the
belief that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noreen</ENAMEX>'s car radio system would demand too much
satellite capacity.
<p>
   ``When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> made them a consortium, they said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMSC</ENAMEX> had to act
like a common carrier,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noreen</ENAMEX> said. ``They're suppose to be like
the telephone company and provide service to all who make a
reasonable request.''
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> did not have enough spectrum to satisfy the requirements
of the 12 companies that initially filed an application, so the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX>
decided to license one entity and basically forced the formation of
the consortium, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> official said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noreen</ENAMEX>, frustrated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMSC</ENAMEX>, resigned from the board in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late
1991</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Several months later</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noreen</ENAMEX> filed a lawsuit in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. District Court</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">District of Columbia</ENAMEX>, alleging
violation of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1934</TIMEX> Communications Act and antitrust Sherman Act.
The case is awaiting a decision on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMSC</ENAMEX>'s summary judgment request
to dismiss the lawsuit, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Haven Chapman</ENAMEX>, an attorney
representing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Radio Satellite</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``This case is in active litigation, so it's inappropriate for
me to comment on Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noreen</ENAMEX>'s claims,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pemberton</ENAMEX> said. ``I will
say we are in the business to make money and want to provide access
to anyone we can, as called for in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX>'s guidelines. It's our
goal to service all customers with high quality and in an equal
way.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMSC</ENAMEX>'s satellite has 2,000 channels, but company officials
declined comment on the percentage of capacity that is in use or
reserved. The company expects to launch the second of three
satellites within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next three years</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMSC</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> tariff requirements, the company will make
reasonable efforts to provide customers with sufficient bandwidth
to support their needs.
<p>
   ``What this says in a vague way is (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMSC</ENAMEX>) will do the best they
can to support customers' requests, but they can't make any
promises,'' said an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> official. ``It seems to me that this brings
to mind a first-come, first-served system.''
<p>
   Satellite industry sources said it may take years before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noreen</ENAMEX>
knows if he will prevail in his fight or see any ripple effects.
<p>
   ``Challenging a license is not a speedy process, and providing
satellite service and products is not a speedy process. Other
ventures are under way that will compete for parts of the business
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noreen</ENAMEX> wants to do,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Gifford</ENAMEX>, editor of Satellite
Communications, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas</ENAMEX>-based magazine.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 25</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s bargain-basement
satellite launch program is losing clients to Russian and French
rivals after a spate of high-profile flops.
<p>
   At least two satellite companies, eager to meet <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>'s growing
demand for satellite broadcasting and telecommunications, have
opted for competing launchers. A third is considering a switch.
<p>
   As more foreign companies look elsewhere, only the loyalty of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s own state-run companies is keeping the Chinese program
going, analysts said.
<p>
   ``Chinese investors are underpinning the commercial viability of
the Chinese launch program as it is losing foreign clients,'' said
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Jeffries</ENAMEX>, editor of the Asia Pacific Space Report. All
Chinese launches <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> are expected to be delayed pending the
results of an investigation into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX>'s failure of a Long
March 3B rocket carrying an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelsat</ENAMEX> communications satellite.
Until recently, foreign companies were willing to trade reliability
for price to launch satellites in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Not anymore.
<p>
   Over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asia Satellite Telecommunications Co.</ENAMEX>, whose
first two satellites <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> launched, said it will send its third
into orbit on a Russian rocket. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EchoStar Communications</ENAMEX>
canceled its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> launch in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> and booked a flight
on a rocket of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arianspace</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mabuhay Philippine Satellite Corp.</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cesar Reyes</ENAMEX> said
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this month</TIMEX> the communications group will decide whether to
cancel its launch plan in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> after more tests on the cause of
the explosion. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s safety record was highlighted after an
Israeli scientist released a videotape on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> of what he said
was a village devastated by the rocket near the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Xichang</ENAMEX> launch site
in southwest <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>. The video, shown on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> television,
showed dozens of flattened houses.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> has claimed only 6 people died in the crash. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>'s South
China Morning Post cited a witness as putting the figure at 100.
One industry executive said that a cover-up of casualty figures,
would raise suspicions that technology faults might also be hushed
up.
<p>
   ``There is a great deal of faith in the market in the
reliability of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russia</ENAMEX>'s rockets,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffries</ENAMEX> of the Space
Report. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>, quite clearly, hasn't established that faith
yet.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> has successfully launched about 40 satellites in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last
20 years</TIMEX>, including eight for foreign clients. It has plans to
launch 30 more satellites for foreign customers by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>. It has had
more than its fair share of accidents, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffries</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January
1995</TIMEX>, a Long March 2E rocket exploded one minute into its flight,
killing 6 villagers nearby. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Months earlier</TIMEX> an engineer had been
killed during a test fire.
<p>
   Officials at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China Great Wall Industry Corp.</ENAMEX>, the satellite
launcher, said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s next launch, of an Apstar-1A satellite,
could come as early as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>. The launch was originally scheduled for
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX> on a Long March 3 rocket.
<p>
   The Apstar-1A satellite, built by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX>
subsidiary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes</ENAMEX>, is owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APT Satellite Co.</ENAMEX>
Its shareholders include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Singapore Telecommunications Ltd.</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Thailand</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charoen Pokphand Group</ENAMEX> and commercial arms of the
Chinese army, space and telecommunications authorities.
<p>
   Other launches lined up for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Wall</ENAMEX> include the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CoSat</ENAMEX>
satellite, a joint venture between the Chinese military and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ChinaSat</ENAMEX>, controlled
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telecoms Ministry</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   For customers without such loyalties there is an alternative. In
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AsiaSat</ENAMEX> signed an agreement with 15 banks to provide
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$200-million</NUMEX> for the construction by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes</ENAMEX> of a high-performance
satellite. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AsiaSat</ENAMEX> has selected <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russia</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proton</ENAMEX> to launch it.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proton</ENAMEX>, whose shareholders include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed Martin Corp.</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSC
Energia</ENAMEX>, is set to launch its first satellite some time <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>.
<p>
   A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Wall</ENAMEX> official, who declined to be named, said the
``primary reason'' why <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AsiaSat</ENAMEX> decided to switch was the
``astonishingly low price'' offered by the Russians. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Wade</ENAMEX>,
deputy chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AsiaSat</ENAMEX>, said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AsiaSat</ENAMEX>
``could go pretty much either way'' in terms of price between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russia</ENAMEX>. He said the main reason for the switch was the absence
of a Chinese launch slot in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AsiaSat</ENAMEX> is partly owned by state-run <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China International Trust
and Investment Corp.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hutchison Whampoa Ltd.</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cable and Wireless Plc</ENAMEX> also have stakes.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sabrina Cubbins</ENAMEX>, marketing manager at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AsiaSat</ENAMEX>, said the contract
was signed before the explosion. She said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AsiaSat</ENAMEX> would look
at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s safety record when choosing who will launch <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AsiaSat</ENAMEX> 4
and 5 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later this century</TIMEX>. Accidents affect future launch costs.
Insurance company officials will gather in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-April</TIMEX> to
review <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s investigation into the Long March 3B failure and
determine how much it will cost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APT Satellite Co.</ENAMEX> to insure the
next launch, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Wall</ENAMEX> official said.
<p>
   In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Shanghai</ENAMEX>-based state-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China Pacific Insurance
Co.</ENAMEX> insured the Apstar-1A satellite for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.3 billion yuan</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$280
million</NUMEX>).

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">SEATTLE</ENAMEX>  &MD;  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing Co.</ENAMEX> moved to sell one business but launched
another one <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>, casting a vote for software over hardware.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> said it will sell its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing Georgia</ENAMEX> subsidiary, which
makes cargo handling equipment for commercial jets. The company
also announced a partnership in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DigitalXpress</ENAMEX>, a venture aimed at
digital satellite transmission of video and data for businesses.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DigitalXpress</ENAMEX> will be a partnership of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing Commercial Space
Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conus Communications</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computing Devices International</ENAMEX>. The
new company will be headquartered in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Paul</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minn.</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conus</ENAMEX>
has a satellite uplink facility. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing Commercial Space</ENAMEX> also is
involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea Launch</ENAMEX>, a partnership that wants to launch rockets
from floating ocean platforms.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> spokeswoman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cindy Glickert</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DigitalXpress</ENAMEX> aims to be
an affordable alternative to conventional media, using
off-the-shelf technology to send data and pictures direct to
business customers. The service will cost around <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,500</NUMEX> for a
satellite dish, receiver and computer interface, plus a
transmission fee.
<p>
   In addition to cost, the system's advantage will be speed,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glickert</ENAMEX> said. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DigitalXpress</ENAMEX> customer could send a 300-page
manual, for example, to any number of distribution points in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">19
seconds</TIMEX>, vs. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">27 minutes</TIMEX> per recipient via conventional electronic
mail.
<p>
   The service would allow pharmaceutical companies to update
records nationwide, or allow wide-scale video conferencing at low
cost, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glickert</ENAMEX> said. The technology is basically the same as that
already employed in direct-to-home digital broadcast systems.
<p>
   ``The installed base of desktop computers is so explosive that
the need for efficient information exchange is greater than ever,''
said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Bearry</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DigitalXpress</ENAMEX> president and chief executive.
``We want to give corporations the ability to afford their own
niche programming and information distribution network.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> will provide satellite and system integration expertise.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conus</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hubbard Broadcasting</ENAMEX>, supplies uplinking and
broadcast experience. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDI</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ceridian Corp.</ENAMEX>, will integrate
information systems. The partnership hopes to announce its first
customer <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next month</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> isn't announcing the buyer for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing Georgia</ENAMEX>, which
employs about 700 people at a plant near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Macon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ga.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> bought
the facility in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Binder</ENAMEX> said the sale will be made as a
result of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> make-buy study, in which the company
decided which production processes it wanted to keep and which it
will out-source to other firms.
<p>
   Officials of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Virginia</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lucas Aerospace</ENAMEX> have been seen
kicking the tires at the plant near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Macon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ga.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lucas</ENAMEX> was
noncommittal about its potential interest in the plant.
<p>
   ``We are in discussions broadly with various companies for
different mergers and acquisitions,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lucas</ENAMEX> spokeswoman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julie
Ballesteros</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Reston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Va.</ENAMEX> ``Some enter the early stages and never
come to fruition.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lucas</ENAMEX> is a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lucas Industries PLC</ENAMEX>, a British-based
manufacturer of aerospace systems and components.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binder</ENAMEX> said that if the sale negotiations fall through, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>
will seek another buyer.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 3</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canal Plus</ENAMEX> said it will
demonstrate extracts from its digital-television programs at a
conference <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</TIMEX>, in preparation for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 27</TIMEX> commercial
launch of the service in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>'s first.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canal Plus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>'s biggest pay-TV company will offer 10
digital channels on Canalsatellite, including films and sports,
company officials said. The company's three transponders for
digital TV can broadcast as many as 24 channels. Customers will
need a special digital decoder to receive the services.
<p>
   Digital TV lets broadcasters send eight digital channels via a
satellite transponder that earlier carried only one. It does this
by converting television pictures into digital data -- a series of
electronic ones and zeros that can be manipulated to change just
parts of a picture, rather than the whole frame.
<p>
   While digitization increases the number of channels -- and thus
the amount of advertising -- that a company can broadcast, it also
demands huge investment in the face of unquantifiable demand.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canal Plus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>'s biggest pay-TV company, expects to log up
to 1.5 million digital pay-TV subscribers by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the decade</TIMEX>.
It needs more than 850,000 subscribers to break even and doesn't
expect a return on its investment for about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The service will be distributed through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canal Plus</ENAMEX>'
Canalsatellite unit using the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Luxembourg</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Societe Europeene
des Satellites</ENAMEX>' Astra satellite.
<p>
   The launch of the service has been delayed from its original
start date <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early last year</TIMEX> as technical problems took longer than
expected to be resolved.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canal Plus</ENAMEX> has also begun a pilot digital service in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>
with its partners, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Havas SA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bertelsmann AG</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Sky
Broadcasting Group Plc</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canal Plus</ENAMEX> picked five companies to build decoders for
its digital service -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thomson Multimedia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philips Electronics NV</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pioneer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sagem</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thomson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philips</ENAMEX> have machines
ready for sale, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canal Plus</ENAMEX> executives said, and will be followed by
the other three.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last month</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thomson</ENAMEX> said it has produced 20,000 digital
decoders, or interactive terminals. The company said the decoders
will cost about <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4,000 to 4,500 French francs</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$800 to $900</NUMEX>)
<p>
   Because the cost of the decoders is high, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canal Plus</ENAMEX> said it's
also offering to buy the decoders from the five suppliers and lease
them out to users for about <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 francs</NUMEX> a month, the company said.
<p>
   With several suppliers and possible increase in demand, the
price of decoders is expected to fall over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next five years</TIMEX>, the
company said.

<p>
   The system is precisely the kind of civilian use of federally
backed technology that the government has been eager to cultivate
since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the Cold War</TIMEX>. It was developed over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last two
years</TIMEX> in a collaboration involving a group of companies including
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amoco</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shell</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevron</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schlumberger</ENAMEX>; federal agencies including
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy Department</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>; and several of the national
research organizations, led by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sandia National Laboratories</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The idea grew out of scribblings on a napkin during dinner <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two
years ago</TIMEX> at a microbrewery in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>. The diners were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David
Beering</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> senior telecommunications analyst, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond
Cline Jr.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sandia</ENAMEX> researcher.
<p>
   Their thoughts had turned to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s launching the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">previous
autumn</TIMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1993</TIMEX>, of an Advanced Communications Technology
Satellite, the first spacecraft that could theoretically handle
digital data of up to 622 million bits a second. As the napkin
diagram took form, they concluded that their system should operate
at about 45 million bits a second. At such speeds the World Book
Encyclopedia could be transmitted in about <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one minute</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Unlike most previous satellites, which might cover the entire
continent with a 75-watt signal, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s ACTS spacecraft uses
high-intensity beams that can focus the 75 watts on a spot only 150
miles in diameter.
<p>
   These focused beams can provide high-quality transmission
through small antennae like the 16 inch by 4 inch flat plate used
on the Geco Diamond.
<p>
   But the ACTS digital satellite link, while crucial, is only the
first leg of the trip. The entire setup, known as Aires, is also
heavily reliant on the ground-based fiber optic networks operated
by telecommunications carriers like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&AMP;T</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sprint</ENAMEX>, which
have been adopting a new high-speed transmission format known as
Asynchronous Transfer Mode networking.
<p>
   ATM, as this technology is known, is a way of shipping digital
information in uniform packets that can be sent via satellite,
fiber optic or coaxial cable or even copper telephone wire without
requiring the costly and time-consuming format conversions that
have long dogged data communications.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beering</ENAMEX> said the concept was similar to the shipping industry's
development of uniform box-car-like containers that can be handled
by truck, boat, train or airplane.
<p>
   The system uses about <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1 billion</NUMEX> worth of equipment and
communication networks. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s cost to build and launch the
satellite was about <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$750 million</NUMEX>. The other government agencies and
the corporations involved picked up the additional <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$250 million</NUMEX> in
equipment costs.
<p>
   So far, about 100 companies and research groups have tested the
system. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing Co.</ENAMEX>, for example, used the system to link its wind
tunnels in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seattle</ENAMEX> with supercomputers at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> research center in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cleveland</ENAMEX>. Engineers sent wind-tunnel readings on an engine inlet,
then used the supercomputer's analysis to make design changes as
the tests were still under way.
<p>
   But it was the oil industry that was particularly interested in
getting involved in the Aires project, as petroleum companies look
for ways to make more efficient use of data-intensive
oil-exploration technology.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zernic</ENAMEX> recalls that when the ACTS satellite program was
authorized by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1980s</TIMEX>, his agency was eager to
show that the effort would have practical applications. And Aires
has demonstrated just that, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zernic</ENAMEX> contends. ``We have to make good
with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> taxpayer's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">dollar</NUMEX>,'' he said.

<p>
   Despite the spectacular failure of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s new generation Long
March 3B satellite launch vehicle in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">US</ENAMEX> aero-space giant
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed Martin</ENAMEX> still plans to use it to launch its ChinaStar 1
satellite in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second half of next year</TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``We have the normal concerns but are confident the launch will
be successful,'' the president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" MIN="Lockheed Martin">Lockheed Martin, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Asia</ENAMEX>,</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Young</ENAMEX>, said.
<p>
   ``The Long March programme as a whole has been pretty successful
and we have established a good working relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China
Great Wall</ENAMEX> [the mainland's satellite launch company],'' Mr <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Young</ENAMEX>
said.
<p>
   Two <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed Martin</ENAMEX> satellites were launched successfully using
Long March 2E rockets in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Mr <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Young</ENAMEX> said it was not unusual for new launch vehicles to fail
on their first or second launch and predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> would continue
to win customers for its launch programme.
<p>
   ``At the moment, demand for satellite launches exceeds supply so
anyone who can offer reasonable costs and a good schedule will be
successful,'' he said.
<p>
   ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> has the additional advantage of having domestic
customers to fill in the gaps between international launches,'' he
said.
<p>
   As yet, it is unknown how far insurance premiums will increase
as a result of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX> disaster but Mr <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Young</ENAMEX> was confident
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> still would be able to offer competitive pricing.
<p>
   The investigation into the cause of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>'s failure should
end <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next month</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Mr <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Young</ENAMEX>, who was in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> for the opening of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed Martin</ENAMEX>'s representative office, said the company planned
to consolidate and expand its business interests throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   In addition to satellites, it has an aircraft maintenance joint
venture in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guangzhou</ENAMEX> and hopes to become involved in airport
development, airport management and air traffic control systems.
<p>
   Mr <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Young</ENAMEX> said the ambitious air infrastructure development
projects in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s Ninth <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Five-Year</TIMEX> Plan would expand opportunites.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greenwich</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Connecticut</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 16</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PanAmSat Corp.</ENAMEX>
said it ordered two satellites from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Space Systems/Loral</ENAMEX> that will
boost its communications capacity by more than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 percent</NUMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greenwich</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Connecticut</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PanAmSat</ENAMEX> said the satellites will
be launched in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1997</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1998</TIMEX>, with one positioned over
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indian Ocean</ENAMEX> to serve <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> and the other
over the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> to serve <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Asia</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The companies didn't reveal the terms of the contract, though
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Marcus</ENAMEX>, a spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PanAmSat</ENAMEX>, said a satellite typically
costs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $200 million and $250 million</NUMEX> to build, launch and
insure.
<p>
   The two satellites, named <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAS</ENAMEX>-7 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAS</ENAMEX>-8, will include 92
transponders, the components that receive signals and relay them
back to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX>. The greater the number of transponders, the greater
the amount of broadcast, telephone and data traffic the satellites
can handle. With the new satellites, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PanAmSat</ENAMEX> will have 304
transponders in the air.
<p>
   ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAS</ENAMEX>-7 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAS</ENAMEX>-8 will enable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PanAmSat</ENAMEX> to offer vastly expanded
broadcast and business communications services to a total
geographic area representing more than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 percent</NUMEX> of the world's
population,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick Landman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PanAmSat</ENAMEX>'s president and
chief executive.
<p>
   Under the terms of the agreement, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Palo Alto</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>-based
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Space Systems/Loral</ENAMEX>, a majority-owned subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loral Corp.</ENAMEX>,
will provide spacecraft components that can be put together rapidly
to produce a replacement satellite in the event of a launch
failure, or as an additional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PanAmSat</ENAMEX> satellite.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PanAmSat</ENAMEX>'s shares fell 3/4 to 28 3/4 in trading of 177,600
shares.
<p>
   The company is majority owned by Mexican broadcaster <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grupo
Televisa SA</ENAMEX> and the family of its late founder, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rene Anselmo</ENAMEX>.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Earlier this month</TIMEX>, it said it hired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley &AMP; Co.</ENAMEX> to seek a
buyer for the company.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PanAmSat</ENAMEX> currently has four satellites in orbit and two under
construction, excluding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAS</ENAMEX>-7 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAS</ENAMEX>-A.
<p>
   The satellites deliver direct-to-home television services and
business communications for 300 companies in countries including
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Africa</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The company leases either entire transponders, or channels on a
transponder, to clients such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX>, which uses the satellite
to link its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> headquarters with branches in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX>, or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viacom Inc.</ENAMEX>, which uses it to distribute television programming to
cable systems around the world.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">SEATTLE</ENAMEX>  &MD;  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing Co.</ENAMEX> would like to make channel surfing a
habit for air travelers.
<p>
   A unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information and Electronic Systems Division</ENAMEX>,
part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense &AMP; Space Group</ENAMEX>, has developed an antenna that
would allow jetliners to snare satellite video feeds in midair. The
75 or so channels you can now get with the new, small home
satellite dishes could also be available in the sky.
<p>
   ``We definitely know the airlines are excited about this,'' said
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Miller</ENAMEX>, acquisition manager for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phased Array Systems
Organization</ENAMEX>, which developed the system.
<p>
   It was, in fact, the high-powered satellites now in use for
direct-to-home broadcast that made the new product possible, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX>
said.
<p>
   Most satellite antennae involve dishes, large or small, that
have to be physically moved or rotated to pick up signals. Those
kinds of antennae won't work on jetliners because the aircraft
moves and the antenna would constantly be out of sync with the
satellite feed. Also, anything that protrudes more than a few
inches from the surface of an aircraft would change its handling
features and increase fuel consumption.
<p>
   So <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> engineers married the technology to a high-tech
antenna that doesn't mind moving, and called it STARS, for
Satellite Telemetry Airborne Receiving System.
<p>
   Instead of a big dish, STARS incorporates a series of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">dime</NUMEX>-size
receptors that are reoriented electronically to lock onto satellite
signals.
<p>
   The result is a flat antenna, 24 inches by 44 inches and less
than 2 inches high when mounted on an aircraft. Including
associated hardware, it weighs about 200 pounds and is relatively
easy to install on existing aircraft. It would be mounted atop the
fuselage between the wings.
<p>
   Airlines regard multiple TV channels as frosting on the cake,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> said. They're especially interested in moving data on and
off aircraft, such as automatically downloading ``black box''
recorder information on a regular basis.
<p>
   ``Airlines are very interested in what it would do to their
operating costs,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> said. Downloading flight data is labor
intensive; automatic downloading also would allow airlines to make
operational adjustments more rapidly.
<p>
   ``They would know what was wrong with the aircraft before it
ever landed,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   STARS can read two satellites at once, so any aircraft equipped
with the antenna can send as well as receive, setting up the
possibility of more interactive communications for passengers as
well as flight crew. The system sends information from the aircraft
in large bursts, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> said, but to a passenger changing hotel
reservations at his or her next stop, the effect will be in real
time.
<p>
   Current systems move about 2,400 bits, or 2.4 kilobits, of data
a second, he said. STARS can move 500,000 kilobits a second. ``It's
a huge breakthrough as far as getting large volumes of data to a
moving platform,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   Airlines are looking at loading manuals, weather maps and
operational data via STARS. They also could load movies via
satellite, instead of taking on new videotapes each month.
<p>
   ``With new entertainment systems, each passenger will basically
have a personal computer in their seat back,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   The price is right, too: about <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$95,000</NUMEX> for the antenna, or a
monthly fee for the antenna and the satellite system. The latter
will be supplied in part by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commercial Space Co.</ENAMEX>, the
company's budding space venture, which also is involved in
satellite launches, new satellite systems and data communications.
<p>
   ``We've made some huge strides in lowering the cost compared to
our competition,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   The competition now is land-based communications systems, such
as those that let people talk by phone in midflight. Nobody else is
making an antenna quite like STARS, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> doesn't expect
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>'s head start to last long.
<p>
   ``That will only last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="18 months">about 18 months</TIMEX>,'' he said. ``We're
already working on improvements.''
<p>
   The system started with military applications, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> is
still pursuing those. Smaller phased array antennae can be mounted
on battlefield vehicles, with satellite-feed data relayed via
military command jets or unmanned aerial vehicles.
<p>
   Even though it's becoming a commercial product, STARS will stay
with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phased Array Systems</ENAMEX>. ``We're going to be working very closely
with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing Commercial Airplane Group</ENAMEX>,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> said. ``They open
all the doors.''
<p>
   The system probably won't go on sale until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, and a lot of
in-flight testing remains. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This summer</TIMEX>, the antenna will be mounted
on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cessna</ENAMEX> 206. It eventually will make its way to
WA001, the original 777 aircraft that is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>'s latest flying
test bed.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">JERUSALEM</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren Christopher</ENAMEX>, shuttling
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Damascus</ENAMEX>, said he was confident of
achieving a cease-fire in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lebanon</ENAMEX> despite ``some difficult
questions to work through.''
<p>
   But hopes for a quick truce faded further <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> as the
cross-border conflict between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> guerrillas
entered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="11th day">its 11th day</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Katyusha</ENAMEX> rocket attacks on northern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX>
were answered by Israeli bombardments in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lebanon</ENAMEX> by warplanes,
gunboats and artillery, although reports said the fighting had
eased compared to previous days.
<p>
   Despite the diplomatic scramble, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> officials told reporters
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher</ENAMEX> still has not been informed by Syrian or Lebanese
intermediaries of the terms <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hezbollah</ENAMEX>, the pro-Iranian <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Party of
God</ENAMEX>, would accept for a cease-fire.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX> has said it would halt its operation when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hezbollah</ENAMEX>'s
rockets stop falling on its towns in the north. But the Israeli
cabinet reiterated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> that the Jewish state would not
unilaterally halt its attacks in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lebanon</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher</ENAMEX> met <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> with President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hafez Assad</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Syria</ENAMEX>
before traveling to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX> for two rounds of talks with Prime
Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shimon Peres</ENAMEX>. He returned to the Syrian capital <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> for talks again on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Assad</ENAMEX>, and is expected to meet
with Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rafiq Hariri</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lebanon</ENAMEX>, possibly by going to
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beirut</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Syria</ENAMEX> has about 40,000 troops stationed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lebanon</ENAMEX> and greatly
influences political and security matters in the country. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Syria</ENAMEX>
controls the routes through which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> receives money and
weapons from its prime backer, the Islamic government in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher</ENAMEX> embarked on his diplomatic mission in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle
East</ENAMEX> after Israeli shelling killed more than 100 Lebanese civilians
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>. The urgent diplomacy comes after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>
administration initially backed the Israeli air and artillery
assault.
<p>
   Now, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher</ENAMEX> is attempting to win assurances that the
current fighting will stop, at least temporarily, to allow
negotiations for new rules for limiting the conflict.
<p>
   ``We should try and not only get a cease-fire, but an enduring
set of understandings which commits the parties in the region to
prevent the recurrence of this kind of event,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   Foreign Ministers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yevgeny Primakov</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herve de
Charette</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> were also in the region seeking to broker an end
to the fighting.
<p>
   But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peres</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX> considered only the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> effort the basis
for a lasting truce.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peres</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX> would listen to all proposals, ``but we cannot
have three agreements on the same issue because this will mean no
agreement at all,'' he told the news conference after meeting with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows).
<p>
   All the diplomatic efforts seek to build on an unwritten <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>
agreement brokered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher</ENAMEX> in which <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hezbollah</ENAMEX>
agreed that civilians would be off-limits.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX>'s blitz, launched <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 11</TIMEX> in response to rocket attacks,
has killed more than 150 Lebanese, most of them civilians, and
forced 400,000 Lebanese to flee their homes. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX>, no one has
died, though more than 30 have been wounded and northern residents
have been forced to live in bomb shelters or flee south out of
range of the sporadic rockets.
<p>
   Lebanese officials say a permanent truce will be possible only
when <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX> agrees to move its troops out of an occupation zone
inside southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lebanon</ENAMEX> that the Jewish state uses as a buffer to
protect its northern border from attacks.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Syria</ENAMEX> gave priority <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> to a French proposal that reportedly
would put the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> agreement in writing and call on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United
States</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Syria</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran</ENAMEX> and European nations to guarantee that
violations would not occur.
<p>
   ``The French plan has several positive points which are worth
discussion to solve the current crisis,'' Foreign Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Farouq
al-Sharaa</ENAMEX> said in the statement issued by the official <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syrian News
Agency</ENAMEX>.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seattle</ENAMEX>-based retailer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eddie Bauer Inc.</ENAMEX> has pulled its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4
million</NUMEX> advertising account from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> ad firm, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hal
Riney &AMP; Partners</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The move comes after three top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Riney</ENAMEX> executives who worked on
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eddie Bauer</ENAMEX> business left to form their own agency, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black
Rocket</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   While at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Riney</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black Rocket</ENAMEX> founders <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Yost</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve
Stone</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Barden</ENAMEX> created the first national advertising
campaign for the apparel company.
<p>
   The print ads, which were launched in magazines around the
country <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX>, show outdoor scenes of people roasting
marshmallows and contain directions for making s'mores. The tag
line reads, ``Never confuse having a career with having a life.''
<p>
   The ads, which may expand into television, were designed to make
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eddie Bauer</ENAMEX> into a brand name.
<p>
   The outdoor-oriented sportswear and footwear retailer is a
subsidiary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spiegel Inc.</ENAMEX>, and operates 294 retail stores and a
mail order catalog.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eddie Bauer</ENAMEX> spokeswoman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheryl Engstrom</ENAMEX> confirmed that the
company has parted ways with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Riney</ENAMEX>, but declined to confirm
industry speculation that the ad business will move to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black
Rocket</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hal Riney</ENAMEX> managing director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Verklin</ENAMEX> said the split was
amicable, since it was never intended to be an ongoing
relationship.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engstrom</ENAMEX> said the retailer has awarded the media buying portion
of the account to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Creative Media</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> and is shopping
for an agency to handle the creative portion.
<p>
   ``I think they're going to use <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black Rocket</ENAMEX> for a TV campaign,''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Verklin</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black Rocket</ENAMEX> wins that account, it would be the fledgling
agency's third since it was formed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The firm is also promoting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yahoo!</ENAMEX>, an Internet search company,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tri Valley Growers</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay Area</ENAMEX> agricultural cooperative.

also shape the company,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierre Lescure</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canal Plus</ENAMEX>,
said in an interview with Le Monde.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canal Plus</ENAMEX> expects to log up to 1.5 million digital pay-TV
subscribers by the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">end of the decade</TIMEX>. It needs more than 850,000
subscribers to break even and doesn't expect a return on its
investment for about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX>.
<p>
   In recent trading, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canal Plus</ENAMEX> shares were up <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">17 francs</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,262
france</NUMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canal Plus</ENAMEX>'s launch comes as a rival group called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Television par
satellite</ENAMEX> prepares to broadcast its own program of digital-TV
programs in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>. The group pools together French
television stations <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TF1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M6</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">France Television</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Luxembourg</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLT</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The group is a ``coalition of francophone interests against a
French company,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lescure</ENAMEX> said. Although he said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canal Plus</ENAMEX>' talks
with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TF1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CLT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">France Television</ENAMEX> over digital television have
failed, ``the tensions between the various audiovisual groups <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>
will soon no longer be relevant,'' he said.
<p>
   Digital TV lets broadcasters send eight channels via a satellite
transponder that earlier carried only one. It does this by
converting television pictures into digital data -- a series of
electronic ones and zeros that can be manipulated to change just
parts of a picture, rather than the whole frame.
<p>
   While digitization increases the number of channels -- and thus
the amount of advertising -- that a company can broadcast, it also
demands huge investment in the face of unquantifiable demand.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canal Plus</ENAMEX> will distribute its digital service through its
Canalsatellite unit using the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Luxembourg</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Societe Europeene
des Satellites</ENAMEX>' Astra satellite.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canal Plus</ENAMEX> has also begun a pilot digital service in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>
with its partners, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Havas SA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bertelsmann AG</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Sky
Broadcasting Group Plc</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Customers will need a special digital decoder to receive the
services.
<p>
   In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canal Plus</ENAMEX> picked five companies to build decoders for
its digital service -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thomson Multimedia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philips Electronics NV</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pioneer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sagem</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thomson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philips</ENAMEX> have machines
ready for sale, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canal Plus</ENAMEX> executives said, and will be followed by
the other three.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last month</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thomson</ENAMEX> said it has produced 20,000 digital
decoders, or interactive terminals. The company said the decoders
will cost about <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4,000 to 4,500 French francs</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$800 to $900</NUMEX>).
<p>
   Because the cost of the decoders is high, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canal Plus</ENAMEX> said it's
also offering to buy the decoders from the five suppliers and lease
them out to users for about <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 francs</NUMEX> a month, the company said.
<p>
   With several suppliers and possible increase in demand, the
price of decoders is expected to fall over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next five years</TIMEX>, the
company said.

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday, April 27</TIMEX>:
<p>
   Thanks to the tireless and skillful mediation of Secretary of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren Christopher</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> of warfare and upheaval in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lebanon</ENAMEX> and northern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX> are ending. No party emerged a
clear-cut winner from the fighting, but all can claim some benefit
from the diplomacy that ended it.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX> achieved its minimum objectives, though at a cost. It won
a promise from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lebanon</ENAMEX> to see that Iranian-backed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hezbollah</ENAMEX>
guerrillas launch no further rocket attacks against <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX> from its
territory. The bombardment, coming after recent suicide bombings in
Israeli cities, had caused many Israelis to question the efficacy
of peace agreements. Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shimon Peres</ENAMEX>, who faces
elections <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next month</TIMEX>, demonstrated that he remains prepared to
defend <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX>'s security with military force when necessary even as
he presses ahead with peace talks.
<p>
   But the civilian casualties caused by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX>'s military
operations, especially the 75 killed in the accidental attack on a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> base crowded with refugees, clouded the legitimate Israeli
objective of self-defense.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lebanon</ENAMEX>, for its part, won relief from the pounding it has taken
from all sides. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX> has now promised that its forces, in pursuit
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> fighters, will no longer fire at civilian targets in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lebanon</ENAMEX>. In the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last two weeks</TIMEX>, more than 150 Lebanese civilians
were killed, 400,000 fled their homes and the country's roads and
water systems were heavily damaged.
<p>
   Israeli troops will remain in a security zone they have
maintained just inside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lebanon</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</TIMEX>, and the Israeli forces
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> guerrillas will probably continue to exchange fire
there. But the new understanding also encourages peace talks
involving <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lebanon</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Syria</ENAMEX> aimed at resolving some of the
issues that led to the fighting, including the existence of the
Israeli zone.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Syria</ENAMEX>, which was not an innocent bystander to the conflict, may
have gained the most from the cease-fire agreement by reclaiming a
central role for itself in the region.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Syrian army</ENAMEX> controls security in much of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lebanon</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> would probably not have launched its rocket attacks
without Syrian approval. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Syria</ENAMEX>'s president, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hafez Assad</ENAMEX>, no doubt
knew the inevitable consequence of unleashing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> would be
Israeli military action against <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lebanon</ENAMEX>. Once the shooting started,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Assad</ENAMEX> sat back in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Damascus</ENAMEX> and waited for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher</ENAMEX> and other
foreign diplomats to pay him court.
<p>
   After a semblance of peace is restored to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lebanon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Syria</ENAMEX> must resume the hard business of negotiating their own peace
agreement. It will not be a moment too soon.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arianespace</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Space
Systems/Loral</ENAMEX> signed an agreement to launch five commercial
satellites <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="2000|year 2000">through the year 2000</TIMEX>.
<p>
   As part of the agreement, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loral</ENAMEX> satellites will be launched on
an Ariane 5 launcher in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">first half of 1998</TIMEX> and four other
flights <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="2000|year 2000">through the year 2000</TIMEX>, said executives from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loral</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arianespace</ENAMEX>. The exact payloads of each launch have yet to be
determined, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Berry</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS/L</ENAMEX>, a subsidiary of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loral Space &AMP; Communications Ltd.</ENAMEX>
<p>
   ``By making these future launch service commitments at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this
time</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SS/Loral</ENAMEX> obtains a set competitive price and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arianespace</ENAMEX>
firms up its calendar for future bookings,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berry</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   Still, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berry</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis Avanzi</ENAMEX>, executive vice president and
chief operating officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arianespace</ENAMEX>, refused to give any details
of the cost of the contract.
<p>
   ``It's within a competitive framework of all the launchers,''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berry</ENAMEX> said. ``It's not the lowest price launch, but it is a launch
service that's able to compete around the world.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Avanzi</ENAMEX> said his company wanted to speak about ``value to our
customers'' rather than price.
<p>
   Shares in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loral Space &AMP; Communications</ENAMEX> rose 1/8 to close at 14
1/2 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arianespace</ENAMEX>, a privately-held consortium of more than 50
European aerospace-related manufacturers, has stepped up its joint
satellite-launch ventures to respond to a potential glut of rocket
launch service providers. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arianespace</ENAMEX> is obviously open to this
kind of thing,'' chairman and chief executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Bigot</ENAMEX> said in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arianespace</ENAMEX> is also planning to set up a subsidiary to offer
customers financing, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Avanzi</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The first launch of an Ariane 5 will take place <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Avanzi</ENAMEX> said. By the time the first <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loral</ENAMEX> launch takes place,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arianespace</ENAMEX> hopes to have had 5 or 6 other Ariane 5 launches, he
said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loral</ENAMEX>'s decision to sign an agreement for five <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arianespace</ENAMEX>
launches is ``an expression of confidence'' in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arianespace</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berry</ENAMEX>
said. It doesn't mean that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loral</ENAMEX> won't be working with other
companies, he said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loral</ENAMEX> is looking at American companies to provide launches for
satellites, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berry</ENAMEX> said. The company is also keeping its options to
send satellites on Long March rockets from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>, even after a Long
March 3B rocket carrying an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelsat</ENAMEX> satellite exploded in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loral Corp.</ENAMEX> had built the satellite, which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rupert
Murdoch</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications Inc.</ENAMEX> had planned to
use to beam television signals to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berry</ENAMEX> referred critics of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s commercial space program to
setbacks in the early days of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> space program.
<p>
   ``Pay attention to what has happened and what hasn't happened
and then put it into context,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berry</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loral Space</ENAMEX> was created as part of the merger of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loral Corp.</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed Martin Corp.</ENAMEX> Under terms of that agreement, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed</ENAMEX> can
own as much as <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loral Space</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed</ENAMEX> has launched many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loral</ENAMEX> satellites in the past, said
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Virnell Bruce</ENAMEX>, a spokeswoman for the company's space and strategic
missiles sector. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loral</ENAMEX>'s decision to sign an agreement with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arianespace</ENAMEX> for five launches isn't a reflection on future launches
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed</ENAMEX> may do for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loral</ENAMEX>, she said.
<p>
   ``Many factors determine launch vehicle selection for
satellites, including availability, capability and cost,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce</ENAMEX>
said. Besides, she said, ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loral</ENAMEX> and other satellite manufacturers
have long-standing relationships with all the launch vehicle
manufacturers.''

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">PITTSBURGH</ENAMEX>  &MD;  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Dodgers</ENAMEX> center fielder <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brett Butler</ENAMEX> had
successful surgery <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> to have his tonsils
removed.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Butler</ENAMEX> was at home in nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Duluth</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> and
planned to watch the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodgers</ENAMEX> play the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pittsburgh Pirates</ENAMEX> via
satellite, his wife, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eveline</ENAMEX>, said.
<p>
   ``I told him I'd let him try, as long as he doesn't get antsy,
he can watch,'' she said. ``If he doesn't behave I'll take it away
an inning at a time.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Butler</ENAMEX>, who is on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15-day</TIMEX> disabled list and could miss up to
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three weeks</TIMEX>, was taking fluids immediately after the procedure and
was able to speak. He will not be allowed any activity for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next
10 to 14 days</TIMEX>, while the wound heals. At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that time</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Butler</ENAMEX> will
begin light stretching.
<p>
   ``The biggest concern was that it would start bleeding,''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eveline Butler</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   Tonsillectomy patients often lose 10 or more pounds during
recovery, and therefore <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Butler</ENAMEX> will begin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> with a diet of
high-calorie, high-protein drinks.
<p>
   As for the talkative <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Butler</ENAMEX>'s fear that he would not be able to
speak for days, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eveline</ENAMEX> said, ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brett</ENAMEX> was up and out of it and
talking in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX>. I said, `Oh darn.' ''
<p>
    &UR; Good news, bad news:  &LR; Shortly after being told he would join
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodgers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> as the roster replacement for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Butler</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Busch</ENAMEX> learned that his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16-month</TIMEX>-old daughter, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shunyl</ENAMEX>,
fractured her pelvis and would be in a body cast for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six weeks</TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``The doctor told me she's going to be fine,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Busch</ENAMEX> said.
``That's all you can do.
<p>
   ``I can't turn this opportunity down.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Busch</ENAMEX>, a right-handed bat off the bench the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodgers</ENAMEX> have lacked,
hit .320 with five homers and 17 RBI at Triple-A <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Albuquerque</ENAMEX>,
despite a foot injury.
<p>
   ``I was confident out of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> training and just took that into
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Busch</ENAMEX> said. ``I knew I had the ability to be up here.
I had the confidence.
<p>
   ``The uncertainty wasn't there. I knew what was up here.''
<p>
    &UR; Notes:  &LR; Shortstop <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greg Gagne</ENAMEX> returned to the lineup after
resting his strained hamstring for five games. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gagne</ENAMEX> said the
hamstring was better, though he feared six consecutive games on
artificial turf, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> and in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cincinnati</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX> has
replaced its turf with grass.... Minor-league infielder <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garey
Ingram</ENAMEX> had surgery <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> to repair his right rotator cuff....
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Albuquerque</ENAMEX> outfielder <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karim Garcia</ENAMEX> had his left elbow examined by
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Jobe</ENAMEX>, who found a strain.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 7</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc</ENAMEX>
said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine-month</TIMEX> pretax profit rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">71 percent</NUMEX> and said it had
leased satellite capacity for a digital television service to be
launched in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> satellite television broadcaster said its subscriber
base grew <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17.5 percent</NUMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past year</TIMEX> to 5.35 million,
boosting pretax profit for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine months to March 31</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">178
million pounds</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$269 million</NUMEX>). That's up from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">104 million pounds</NUMEX> in
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year-earlier period</TIMEX>. Earnings per share rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">53 percent</NUMEX>, to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">9.7
pence</NUMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSkyB</ENAMEX> also said it had agreed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Societe Europeene des
Satellites</ENAMEX> to lease half the capacity of a new Astra satellite,
which will be launched in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1997</TIMEX>. The 14 transponders, which
transmit television signals to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>, will be used to provide a
digital service in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX> with space for up to 140
channels.
<p>
   ``We will probably offer the digital service from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn of
next year</TIMEX>, when the satellite is launched,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Brooke</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSkyB</ENAMEX>'s finance director, in an interview.
<p>
   He said the agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SES</ENAMEX> cost less than the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">375 million
pounds</NUMEX> it's paying for 10 digital transponders on other Astra
satellites, which would be used for transmission to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   With digital technology between six and ten channels can be
broadcast at the same time through a single transponder, compared
with only one under existing analogue systems.
<p>
   Sales rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 percent</NUMEX>, to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">736 million pounds</NUMEX>, and operating
profit <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32 percent</NUMEX>, to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">223 million pounds</NUMEX>.
<p>
   ``The results are in line with expectations,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey
Harwood</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robert Fleming Securities</ENAMEX>. ``The subscriber
numbers are quite good.''

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 7</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc</ENAMEX>
said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine-month</TIMEX> pretax profit rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">71 percent</NUMEX> and said it has
leased satellite capacity for a digital television service to be
launched in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> satellite television broadcaster said its subscriber
base grew <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17.5 percent</NUMEX> during the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past year</TIMEX> to 5.35 million,
boosting pretax profit for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine months to March 31</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">178
million pounds</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$269 million</NUMEX>). That's up from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">104 million pounds</NUMEX> in
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year-earlier period</TIMEX>. Earnings per share rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">53 percent</NUMEX>, to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">9.7
pence</NUMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSkyB</ENAMEX> also said it had agreed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Societe Europeene des
Satellites</ENAMEX> to lease half the capacity of a new Astra satellite,
which will be launched in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1997</TIMEX>. The 14 transponders, which
transmit television signals to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>, will be used to provide a
digital service in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX> with space for up to 140
channels.
<p>
   ``We will probably offer the digital service from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn of
next year</TIMEX>, when the satellite is launched,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Brooke</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSkyB</ENAMEX>'s finance director, in an interview.
<p>
   He said the agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SES</ENAMEX> cost less than the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">375 million
pounds</NUMEX> it's paying for 10 digital transponders on other Astra
satellites, which would be used for transmission to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   With digital technology, between six and ten channels can be
broadcast at the same time through a single transponder, compared
to only one under existing analogue systems.
<p>
   Sales rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 percent</NUMEX>, to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">736 million pounds</NUMEX>, and operating
profit <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32 percent</NUMEX>, to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">223 million pounds</NUMEX>.
<p>
   ``The results are in line with expectations,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey
Harwood</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robert Fleming Securities</ENAMEX>. ``The subscriber
numbers are quite good.''
<p>
   Pretax profit for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">third-quarter</TIMEX> rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45.3 percent</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">71.18
million pounds</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">49.04 million pounds</NUMEX> previously. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nigel Reed</ENAMEX>, an
analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paribas Capital Markets</ENAMEX>, said the company is on course
for his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full-year</TIMEX> forecast of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">248 million pounds</NUMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSkyB</ENAMEX>'s shares rose as much as <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 pence</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.2 percent</NUMEX>, before
falling back to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">454p</NUMEX>, unchanged. That's down from a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52-week</TIMEX> high of
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">484.5</NUMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 2</TIMEX>. The shares have risen from a low of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">266</NUMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 23
last year</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">From January to March</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSkyB</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> subscribers rose by 149,000

<p>
   Press reports have said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSkyB</ENAMEX> is negotiating with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BBC</ENAMEX> for it
to provide up to 12 new channels for the digital system, and with
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Branson</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virgin Group Ltd</ENAMEX>, which may provide channels for
young people.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSkyB</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brooke</ENAMEX> said the company is talking to most of the

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">HOUSTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Though faced with daunting technical and financial
hurdles, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ENAMEX> embarks
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> on an ambitious campaign to develop a revolutionary
reusable rocket.
<p>
   It is the first attempt by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> to build a major
new rocket transportation system since the space shuttle a
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter-century ago</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Proponents believe plans by the space agency to spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1 billion</NUMEX>
to build and fly the X-33 in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX> will blaze a trail to the
spacefarers' Holy Grail  &MD;  cheap transportation off the planet.
<p>
   The X-33 is a small, test version of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s ultimate goal, a
fully reusable, single-stage, unpiloted rocket that would gradually
replace the shuttle and the country's stable of commercial rockets
after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">turn of the century</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Skeptics question, however, whether technologies will emerge
rapidly enough to supply the tough but lightweight construction
materials and robust propulsion system vital to the program's
success.
<p>
   More significantly, they wonder if the space agency, which faces
sharply falling budgets, has a practical financing strategy for the
estimated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5 billion to $10 billion</NUMEX> that will be required to build
the full-sized craft.
<p>
   ``There is some real thrust behind this,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Grey</ENAMEX>,
director of aerospace and science policy for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Institute
of Aeronautics and Astronautics</ENAMEX>. ``But there are some real
problems, any of which could be a show stopper.''
<p>
   Within aerospace circles, the groundbreaking technology <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> is
pioneering is called single-stage-to-orbit, or SSTO, and the craft
is known as a reusable launch vehicle, or RLV. The shuttle, in
comparison, has a two-stage propulsion system, with a towering
costly external propellent tank that is used once.
<p>
   The ultimate aims of the effort are to:
<p>
    &MD;  Produce a fully reusable, one-stage rocket by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2008</TIMEX>.
<p>
    &MD;  Design it for 100 orbital missions and simplified ground
operations in order to drop the cost of delivering cargo to orbit
from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10,000</NUMEX> per pound now to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,000</NUMEX> per pound or less.
<p>
   In a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> policy decision, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> administration asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>
to develop a craft that remedied the main frustration with the
shuttle, which can do many things but is too mechanically complex
to be an inexpensive, frequent flier.
<p>
   The space agency is using a phased approach. The X-33 must score
high marks during its series of test flights before a national
policy decision to proceed with the RLV.
<p>
   For the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past year</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell International</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonnell Douglas</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed Martin</ENAMEX>, using <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$7 million</NUMEX> each in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> seed money, have
been preparing competitive proposals for an X-33 and a development
scheme for an SSTO. All three plan to meet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> deadline
for the submission.
<p>
   In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early July</TIMEX>, the space agency will select one of the companies
as its industrial partner for the X-33. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marshall Space Flight
Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Huntsville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ala.</ENAMEX>, will lead the development effort.
<p>
   As it gradually replaces the space shuttle, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> envisions
equipping the new rocket with a crew capsule or possibly a small
spaceplane to carry its astronauts to and from orbit.
<p>
   ``This program has strong support in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White
House</ENAMEX>.'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lori Garver</ENAMEX>, executive director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Space
Society</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>-based public interest group, and a member of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA Advisory Council</ENAMEX>. ``There have been several other attempts
with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Defense</ENAMEX> that took a stab at a new vehicle.
All have failed.''
<p>
   A succession of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>-led programs called the Advanced Launch
System, the National Launch System and Spacelifter as well as a
joint effort with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> called the National Aerospace Plane all
faltered over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past decade</TIMEX> from lack of legislative backing.
<p>
   ``We are changing the rules of the game,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Payton</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>-based director of advanced transportation. ``We
are not trying incremental improvements. Everything is brand new.''
<p>
   If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> adheres to the safeguards of its SSTO development
strategy, it could never proceed further than the X-33 without
demonstrating prescribed breakthroughs, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Payton</ENAMEX> contends.
<p>
   Those include lightweight composite propellant tanks; a sensor
system throughout the spacecraft to alert a small ground crew to
maintenance needs and potential equipment failures; and rocket
engines superior to the shuttle's.

REPUBLICANS SEEK TO REINTRODUCE `STAR WARS' ANTI-MISSILE DEFENSE
PROGRAM

<TEXT>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Congressional Republicans, eager to turn defense
policy into a major issue in the presidential campaign, are
preparing to present President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> with legislation that they
will portray as a test of his commitment to national defense.
<p>
   The first test is to come in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next few weeks</TIMEX> as the full
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> debate legislation sponsored by Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Dole</ENAMEX>, the
presumptive Republican presidential nominee, that will force the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> to spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions of dollars</NUMEX> on the deployment of a
national missile defense system by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The bill, which revives the national debate over the
anti-missile technology popularly known as Star Wars, is expected
to be passed by both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>, setting the stage for a
veto by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Called the Defend America Act, the bill is sponsored in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> by Speaker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newt Gingrich</ENAMEX> and is to come up for a vote in the
full <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>, along with the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$267 billion</NUMEX> military
authorization bill.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> may veto the authorization bill if it retains provisions
requiring the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> to spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$13 billion</NUMEX> more than it requested.
Votes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> on the missile defense bill and its version of
the authorization bill are expected shortly.
<p>
   Although polls suggest that American voters are far more
concerned with the economy than with defense, especially with the
cold war a fading memory, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> and other Republican leaders are
eager to persuade voters that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> administration has been
lax on defense and that a second <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> term could leave Americans
vulnerable to attack from missiles fired by countries like <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North
Korea</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Libya</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   In recent speeches on the campaign trail, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> has argued that
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s lack of support for a missile defense system was proof of
his weakness on issues of military and foreign policy.
<p>
   ``The fact is that we can't destroy a single missile,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX>
said in a speech <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX>. ``That's not because <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX> is
lacking the technical know-how. It's because <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX> is lacking the
presidential leadership to get it done.''
<p>
   In a speech <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>, he called for the creation of a program
in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> would work with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX> on
a missile defense effort to protect all three countries. ``Missile
defense is essential to our allies' security,'' he said.
<p>
   Only <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> have nuclear-armed ballistic missiles that
can reach the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> officials say it will be at
least a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decade</TIMEX> before other, smaller nations develop missiles able
to reach the continental <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>, although they acknowledge
that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Korea</ENAMEX> may be only a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">few years</TIMEX> away from deploying a
ballistic missile that can hit parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alaska</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> has focused on the threat from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Korea</ENAMEX>, which he
described <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> as ``armed to the teeth'' and ``determined to
develop weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver
them.''
<p>
   The administration estimates the cost of the missile defense
system, which would depend on laser-equipped satellites and
ground-based rockets, at more than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$20 billion</NUMEX>.
<p>
   The administration has proposed that instead of moving
immediately to deploy a missile defense system, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> should
continue to study missile defense technology for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three more years</TIMEX>
and then decide on whether deployment is needed.
<p>
   Administration officials say their plan would allow a system to
be built in time to deal with a potential threat from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Korea</ENAMEX>
or other countries and allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United State</ENAMEX> to choose the best
possible system.
<p>
   ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gingrich</ENAMEX> bill says we must choose a system now and
begin deploying it in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX>, independent of how our threat
assessment evolves,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Perry</ENAMEX> said in a
recent speech. ``Our plan says, `Let's develop the system, then
assess the threat in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX>, and make our deployment decision
accordingly.'''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perry</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> bill would cripple the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</TIMEX> Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty and endanger other arms control agreements with
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russia</ENAMEX> that call for the dismantling of thousands of nuclear
warheads.
<p>
   Moreover, administration officials say the Republicans should be
far more concerned about the possibility of rogue nations or
terrorist groups slipping weapons of mass destruction into the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> through less exotic means than a missile.
<p>
   ``A terrorist with a little technical know-how and 20 pounds of
smuggled plutonium could make a bomb powerful enough to destroy a
city,'' said a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> official ``That's what we should be worried
about.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> vetoed the entire military authorization bill <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>
when it mandated a missile defense system. He signed a later
version of the bill that removed the provision. Republicans offered
the missile plan in a separate bill <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>, hoping to draw more
attention to the issue.
<p>
   The controversy harkens back to the debate in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980s</TIMEX> over the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> administration's Strategic Defense Initiative, popularly
known as Star Wars. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> spent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">tens of billions of
dollars</NUMEX> on that research to develop a system that was never
deployed to defend against incoming nuclear-armed missiles. But the
research from that earlier effort could be incorporated in the
missile defense system proposed in the new bill.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> has tried repeatedly to interject defense issues into the
presidential campaign. In recent campaign appearances, he has
called on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> to expand the production line for B-2 bombers,
insisting that the planned fleet of 21 will not meet defense needs.
<p>
   The administration rejected the proposal, noting that senior
officials of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> say it does not need more of the
bombers, which cost over <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$500 million</NUMEX> each. The bombers are built
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> enjoys a big lead over <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> in polls
of prospective voters.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">CAPE CANAVERAL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>  &MD;  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macy</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thanksgiving Day</TIMEX> parade may
have to give up bragging rights after the space shuttle Endeavour
crew flies its version of a giant balloon <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The astronauts will inflate a 100-foot-long Mylar antenna that
will grow to almost the size of the shuttle. The exercise is
designed to test techniques for deploying large but lightweight
inflatable structures.
<p>
   The antenna is the centerpiece of a variety of science and
technology experiments on the mission.
<p>
   The shuttle and its six astronauts are scheduled to lift off
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kennedy
Space Center</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6:30 a.m. EDT</TIMEX>. Countdown activities for
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10-day</TIMEX> mission were proceeding smoothly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>, and the weather
outlook remained favorable.
<p>
   ``Overall, we have no technical concerns,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Debbie
Frostrom</ENAMEX>, who supervises countdown activities at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kennedy</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The crew, with one rookie and five veterans, will deploy two
research satellites in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="first four days">the first four days of the mission</TIMEX> and then
maneuver the shuttle to rendezvous with the small crafts.
<p>
   The shuttle's pilot, Lt. Col. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Curtis Brown, Jr.</ENAMEX>, said the
mission is a dream flight for a pilot.
<p>
   ``We get to do a lot of flying,'' he said. ``The rendezvous will
be the cream of the flight.''
<p>
   On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="second day">the second day of the mission</TIMEX>, the astronauts will release a
small spacecraft called Spartan-207, which has been used for
astronomy research on seven prior missions. On this trip, Spartan
will serve as a platform for unfurling the inflatable antenna.
<p>
   ``This is going to be a unique one. And one that has the
potential to be very visually exciting and spectacular even,'' said
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Steiner</ENAMEX>, Spartan mission manager.
<p>
   By successfully inflating the antenna in orbit, researchers hope
to figure out a way to deploy other large structures at low cost.
<p>
   Here's how the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$14 million</NUMEX> technology experiment works: The
Spartan, carrying a canister about the size of a kitchen table,
will be lifted out of the payload bay by the shuttle's long robotic
arm and released.
<p>
   As it orbits, Spartan will be activated, and the shuttle will
back 400 feet away from the 2,800-pound experiment.
<p>
   Almost immediately, the side flaps on the canister will fold
down and the antenna, with its three 92-foot-long struts and
50-foot-wide dish, will be inflated like a balloon with nitrogen
gas. The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">million-dollar</NUMEX> structure will grow to about the size of a
tennis court within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The crew will then observe the structure for an orbit (about <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">90
minutes</TIMEX>) before the antenna is jettisoned from the satellite. ``I
think it's going to be a really amazing sight, because it'll be a
huge ... silver mirror,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andy Thomas</ENAMEX>, the rookie mission
specialist on the flight.
<p>
   The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next day</TIMEX>, the shuttle will rendezvous with Spartan, and a
crew member will use the robotic arm to retrieve the carrier and
return it to its cargo bay cradle. The inflatable structure should
burn up within days.
<p>
   If the deployment procedure proves workable, functional versions
of the antenna will be coated with a substance that hardens when
exposed to sunlight, giving the structure a protective shell.
<p>
   Endeavour also will carry a Satellite Test Unit to try out a new
laser-based attitude system for positioning spacecraft. On the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="fourth day">fourth day of the mission</TIMEX>, the STU, a small, brightly colored
canister, will be ejected from the payload in an unstable attitude,
with the top weighted like a dart. The shuttle will immediately
back away from the tumbling satellite.
<p>
   Scientists hope the thin atmosphere and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>'s magnetic
field will stabilize the satellite, eliminating the need for
heavier and more costly guidance and steering thruster systems. The
STU's stabilization and performance will be measured by using a
laser that illuminates the STU's reflectors and records images on a
mounted camera.
<p>
   The shuttle will rendezvous with the STU <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="three days">three days after its
release</TIMEX> and possibly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four days later</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Also aboard Endeavour will be a series of science experiments,
including the study of crystal growth in microgravity, the study of
semi-conducting material when heated in space, and the observation
of 12 rats.
<p>
   Mission specialist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Bursch</ENAMEX>, Commander <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Casper</ENAMEX>, Mission
Specialist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mario Runco</ENAMEX> and Canadian mission specialist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marc Garneau</ENAMEX>
make up the rest of the crew.

ASTRONAUTS INFLATE ANTENNA IN SPACE
(For use by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times News Service</ENAMEX> clients.)

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">HOUSTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Endeavour's astronauts inflated a huge Mylar antenna
in space <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, but it unexpectedly tumbled end over end, leaving
researchers unable to get a good look at it.
<p>
   The release of the tennis court-sized balloon on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="second day">second day
of the shuttle's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10-day</TIMEX> mission</TIMEX> appeared to go smoothly. The
prototype antenna popped from its carrier like a jack-in-the-box,
and its three 92-foot accordion struts inflated as planned. But the
antenna, with its large parabolic dish supported by the struts,
began rotating and tumbling.
<p>
   Researchers could not confirm if the 50-foot diameter dish
inflated fully because of the constant motion.
<p>
   ``There is a concern that maybe it didn't,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Bard</ENAMEX>,
project manager. ``It didn't look like we thought it would, but
maybe we didn't know what it would look like with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> in the
background and the way the lighting was.''
<p>
   Researchers also were surprised by what appeared to be a
rippling on the surface of the dish. The researchers will get some
answers when the shuttle returns to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> with the recorded data.
<p>
   Regardless, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bard</ENAMEX> said, the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$14 million</NUMEX> experiment showed that
large structures can be inflated in orbit. Researchers want to
learn how to deploy inflatable structures, because they weigh less,
cost less and may be more reliable.
<p>
   ``Even in the worst case, from what we've seen, it's very close
to a full success,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bard</ENAMEX> said of the experiment. ``I think we will
learn a lot from this that will take us to using it for
applications.''
<p>
   Astronaut <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mario Runco</ENAMEX> used the shuttle's 50-foot robotic arm to
deploy Spartan, a satellite used as the inflatable's platform. The
antenna was stored in a large box atop Spartan. After the satellite
was released, the shuttle backed away by about 400 feet.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Two hours later</TIMEX>, when the flaps of the box folded down, the
antenna unfurled. It was inflated with nitrogen gas within minutes
and looked like a silver parachute.
<p>
   From the shuttle, video pictures taken of the huge antenna
reflecting the sun with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Grand Canyon</ENAMEX> in the background were
breathtaking. The antenna was observed for one orbit, about <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">90
minutes</TIMEX>, and then was jettisoned from Spartan.
<p>
   The antenna is expected to re-enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>'s atmosphere and
burn up sometime <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>. Spartan mission manager <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Steiner</ENAMEX> said
the tumbling problem will have to be resolved before a working
antenna can be deployed.
<p>
   The deployment of the balloon came a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> after the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dawn</TIMEX> launch
of Endeavour from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kennedy Space Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX>. For the
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME" MIN="Monday">rest of Monday</TIMEX>, the crew turned its attention to several science
experiments, including studies of sea urchin eggs and mussels.

SHUTTLE CREW RETRIEVES SATELLITE

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">HOUSTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Endeavour's Canadian astronaut used the shuttle's
robot arm to pluck an 1800-pound satellite from space and return it
to its berth in the cargo bay <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The shuttle flew within 35 feet of the Spartan satellite after a
series of small steering-jet maneuvers. The rendezvous was the
first of a record four planned for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10-day</TIMEX> shuttle mission.
<p>
   ``That was a real pretty piece of flying <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mission
Control</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson Space Center</ENAMEX> told shuttle Commander
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Casper</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Astronaut <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marc Garneau</ENAMEX>, who became the first Canadian in space
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>, reached out from the shuttle with the 50-foot mechanical
arm to capture the Spartan satellite, which was used in the
mission's primary experiment <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>. The satellite was hooked to
the arm for about an <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hour</TIMEX> before it was slowly returned to its
cradle and latched down.
<p>
   Spartan was used as a platform for the inflation of a huge
antenna, which later was jettisoned from the satellite. Spartan
carries important data from that experiment, which tested lighter
and less expensive ways to put large structures in space.
Researchers are anxious to get Spartan back to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>, because it
was difficult for them to see if the antenna's parabolic dish had
inflated. The antenna had unexpectedly tumbled end over end, making
it hard to see its shape clearly.
<p>
   Inside Spartan are measurements taken by lasers and pressure
sensors that will provide some answers for researchers. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>
officials said the antenna, Spartan and the shuttle were visible in
some parts of the southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE|TIME">early Tuesday morning</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Officials at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson Space Center</ENAMEX> saw the spacecraft.
<p>
   ``It was the brightest orbiting object I think most of us have
seen,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill McArthur</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mission Control</ENAMEX>. ``We saw a faint
little Spartan streaking across the sky with Endeavour in hot
pursuit.''
<p>
   The antenna was expected to re-enter <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>'s atmosphere and burn
up.
<p>
   The shuttle crew will deploy a second satellite <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> in an
experiment to test whether <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>'s magnetic field can be used to
help stabilize an object in orbit. It the test is successful, it
could lead to a new generation of satellites that would not need
steering jets.
<p>
   The multiple rendezvous required on Endeavour's mission make
fuel conservation crucial. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casper</ENAMEX> had to burn more fuel than
planned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> to keep up with the tumbling antenna but made up for
it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> by using less than expected for the Spartan rendezvous.
<p>
   Endeavour's only problem on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="third day">third day of the mission</TIMEX> was
that its Coke machine is on the fritz. The soft drinks, which are
flying as part of a fluids experiment, are not being dispensed
properly. The crew spent some time before <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">bedtime</TIMEX> troubleshooting
the problem.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">NEW LONDON</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>  &MD;  President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> used a commencement speech
at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Coast Guard Academy</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> to launch a broad
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">election year</TIMEX> defense of his foreign policy and attack Republicans
for a ``misguided'' missile defense program.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> lashed into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> anti-missile system just as the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congressional Budget Office</ENAMEX> was estimating the cost at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$30 billion
to $60 billion</NUMEX>, a price tag so high that even congressional
Republicans who were expecting the cost to be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $4 billion
and $15 billion</NUMEX> were backing away from it.
<p>
   On Capitol Hill, lawmakers delayed action on the missile defense
shield, which has been proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s Republican
presidential rival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> Majority Leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert J. Dole</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>
Speaker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newt Gingrich</ENAMEX>, R-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ga.</ENAMEX>
<p>
   Even so, the cost estimates gave the Democratic president an
opening to attack his conservative critics for wasteful spending.
<p>
   ``The possibility of a long-range missile attack on American
soil by a rogue state is more than a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decade</TIMEX> away,'' the president
said, as he dismissed the Republican plan as a costly program that
could be obsolete by the time it's built.
<p>
   ``I believe this plan is misguided,'' he said. ``It would weaken
our defenses by taking money away from things we know we need right
now.''
<p>
   The so-called National Missile Defense system calls for air- and
ground-based weapons to shoot down incoming missiles, and is
especially designed to ward off future threats from countries such
as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iraq</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> argued that his own program is ``based on
real threats and pragmatic responses.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s aides offered cost details later that gave a somewhat
less drastic picture of the Republican proposal. The price estimate
of up to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$60 billion</NUMEX> would include both research and construction
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="2010|year 2010">through the year 2010</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> press secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael McCurry</ENAMEX>
told reporters. The Republican system is estimated to cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10
billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between now and the year 2003</TIMEX>, he said.
<p>
   By contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> called for spending <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2.5 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="2003|year 2003">through
the year 2003</TIMEX>, but only for researching and developing a defensive
shield against long- and medium-range missiles. He has offered no
plans for actual construction.
<p>
   On a shimmering day with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Guard</ENAMEX>'s three-masted tall
ship, the Eagle, visible in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Thames River</ENAMEX> nearby, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>
defended his record of sending <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> troops to foreign trouble spots
and forging international trade accords.
<p>
   ``We cannot withdraw into a fortressed <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>'' on trade or
security matters, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> said as he portrayed his foreign policy
course as one of ``rejecting the call to isolation'' but also
``refusing to be the world's policeman.''
<p>
   Hailing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Guard</ENAMEX>'s role in combating drug smuggling, he
told the class of about 230 graduating cadets, including 30 women,
in dress white uniforms that ``you will have the tools you need to
get the job done.''
<p>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
<p>
   As the president visited the military academy, his aides were
fending off a new attack on his role as commander-in-chief.
<p>
   In a statement released by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s lawyer
charged Republicans in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> were attempting to ``distort'' a
legal brief in which the president claimed that he should not have
to face a trial in a sexual harassment suit while he's in office.
<p>
   As part of the brief filed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Supreme Court</ENAMEX>, the
presidential lawyer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert S. Bennett</ENAMEX> had used a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1940</TIMEX> law passed to
protect <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> servicemen from facing lawsuits while on duty.
<p>
   Chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Veterans Affairs Committee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Stump</ENAMEX>,
R-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ariz.</ENAMEX>, and Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Dornan</ENAMEX>, R-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, attacked that claim. ``You
are not a person in military service, nor have you ever been,''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stump</ENAMEX> wrote in a letter to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX> admitted that he included the immunity law in his brief,
``although we have not relied on it in this case.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCurry</ENAMEX> brushed off the complaint: ``This goes to the heart of
the matter, which is that the president is president <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours a
day</TIMEX>.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> has been sued by a former <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arkansas</ENAMEX> employee, but the
case has been appealed to the high court as his lawyers attempt to
hold off the trial until <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> has left the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  The Delta Clipper, the experimental rocket that
takes off and lands on its tail, is flying again to test new
technology that may be applied to the next generation of satellite
launchers.
<p>
   The unmanned rocket, renamed from DC-X to DC-XA for Delta
Clipper Experimental Advanced, spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="year">almost a year</TIMEX> on the ground
being fitted with new components before resuming its airborne test
program on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 18</TIMEX> with a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one-minute</TIMEX> flight at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">White Sands
Missile Range</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Mexico</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Crammed with new lightweight components, including a
liquid-oxygen fuel tank and a backup power system made in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russia</ENAMEX>,
the vertical-landing rocket is testing technologies that could put
future cargoes into space at far less cost than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``The DC-XA is essentially the DC-X rebuilt from the inside
out,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Dumbacher</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Aeronautics and Space
Administration</ENAMEX> manager of the program. ``Externally, it looks the
same, but it's really a very different vehicle.''
<p>
   Inside the 42-foot-tall, four-engine rocket, a liquid-hydrogen
fuel tank made of aluminum has been replaced with one made of
graphite-epoxy composite material 1,100 pounds lighter. In
addition, composites have replaced heavier metal for a support
structure between fuel tanks and for a liquid-hydrogen fuel line
and valve.
<p>
   The Russian-made liquid-oxygen fuel tank, made of an
aluminum-lithium alloy, is one-third lighter than a conventional
aluminum tank. Another Russian component is a modified auxiliary
power unit, run by gases taken from the rocket's liquid propellants
instead of a separate fuel supply, that is being used to power the
craft's hydraulic system.
<p>
   Over all, the modifications reduced the bullet-shaped DC-XA's
dry weight to 20,000 pounds, a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 percent</NUMEX> drop, giving the vehicle
a fueled takeoff weight of 42,000 pounds, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dumbacher</ENAMEX> said in an
interview.
<p>
   Engineers are particularly interested in knowing how the strong,
plastic-like composite materials, which are increasingly being used
in aircraft and spacecraft because of their light weight, will hold
up after repeatedly being exposed to super-cold liquid fuels under
pressure, experts said.
<p>
   The Delta Clipper was developed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ballistic Missile Defense
Organization</ENAMEX> for the ``Star Wars'' missile defense program and flew
eight times <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from August 1993 to July 1995</TIMEX>. The one-of-a-kind rocket
was then transferred to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> to demonstrate technology for its X-33
program. This is a government-industry effort to build a larger
experimental rocket that would fly in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> and serve as a prototype
for an even bigger commercially owned launcher that could be the
nation's main cargo carrier in space <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="decade">within a decade</TIMEX>, eventually
replacing the space shuttle.
<p>
   On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 13</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> received rocket design studies and business
plans for operating the craft from three aerospace groups vying to
be selected to build the X-33 rocket. The X-33 will be the working
model for a bigger, single-stage vehicle that could fly into space
and back without any disposable parts, like strap-on boosters that
drop off in flight. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> will decide in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX> which of the
proposals, which differ radically in design, to build to test the
advanced technology needed for an operational rocket.
<p>
   In addition to the vertical-takeoff and vertical-landing
proposal from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonnell Douglas Corp.</ENAMEX> and its partner, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing Co.</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell International Corp.</ENAMEX> and partners have
proposed making a winged craft that looks somewhat like a larger
version of the space shuttle, which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX> builds, but without
the auxiliary booster rockets and large external tank. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX>
design for the X-33 would rise vertically and land on a runway like
an airplane.
<p>
   The third proposed design, by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed Martin</ENAMEX>, is for a
wingless, flat-bottomed rocket called a lifting body that would
take off vertically and land horizontally on a runway.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">HOUSTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  The shuttle Endeavour glided to a landing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kennedy Space Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX>, ending a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10-day</TIMEX>
science extravaganza in space.
<p>
   The shuttle touched down on time at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7:09 a.m. EDT</TIMEX> after the
threat of rainy weather at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cape Canaveral</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>, diminished. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>
workers were ready at the shuttle's backup landing site at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Edwards
Air Force Base</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> in case the weather prevented an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East
Coast</ENAMEX> touchdown.
<p>
   ``Welcome back, Endeavour. Congratulations on a highly
successful flight,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eileen Collins</ENAMEX>, spacecraft communicator
at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mission Control</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson Space Center</ENAMEX>, as the
shuttle came to a stop on the runway.
<p>
   The astronauts appeared tired at a news conference <TIMEX TYPE="TIME" MIN="six hours">six hours
after landing</TIMEX> but were enthusiastic about their flight. ``This was
a great mission. Just a fantastic mission for all of us,'' said
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Casper</ENAMEX>, the commander.
<p>
   The lone rookie on Endeavour, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andy Thomas</ENAMEX>, said he was having
trouble getting his ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> legs back'' and feeling a bit shaky in
gravity. But of the mission, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas</ENAMEX> said: ``It's the stuff dreams
are made of.''
<p>
   The other crew members were pilot <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Curt Brown</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Bursch</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mario
Runco Jr.</ENAMEX> and Canadian <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marc Garneau</ENAMEX>. During the mission, the
astronauts deployed two research satellites and made a record four
rendezvous with the crafts. ``This was a pilot's dream flight,''
said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Casper</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The flight's most spectacular experiment came on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="second day">the second day
of the mission</TIMEX>, when the astronauts deployed a satellite called
Spartan and inflated a Mylar antenna the size of a tennis court.
Spartan served as a platform for the antenna, which, supported by
three 92-foot-long struts, was inflated in a matter of minutes with
nitrogen gas. The balloon was jettisoned from Spartan and burned up
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>'s atmosphere <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days later</TIMEX>. Spartan was retrieved with
the shuttle's robot arm.
<p>
   The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$14 million</NUMEX> experiment was designed to show that large,
lightweight structures can be inflated in space for less cost than
mechanical ones.
<p>
   Scientists were eager to get Spartan back on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>, because it
holds data from the experiment. The antenna had unexpectedly
tumbled end over end, making it difficult to see if its parabolic
dish had inflated. A second satellite, called STU, was chased down
three times after deployment for observations. The experiment
proved that satellites can stabilize by using their mass and
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>'s magnetic field. Conventional satellites rely on expensive
thruster jets.
<p>
   The STU is expected to burn up in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>'s atmosphere in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX>.
<p>
   When the astronauts weren't tracking satellites, they focused on
dozens of science experiments aboard the shuttle. Fourteen
ultrapure semiconductor crystals were grown in a hot furnace,
giving researchers good seed material for making pure semiconductor
materials on the ground. Thousands of fertilized sea urchin eggs,
starfish and blue clams returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> with the astronauts.
Researchers hope to learn about embryonic development and feeding
patterns from the tiny animals in the shuttle aquarium.
<p>
   Endeavour will be ferried to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Palmdale</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight months</TIMEX>
of refurbishing and modification, so it can carry hardware for the
planned international space station. It is not expected to fly
again until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1997</TIMEX>.

<TEXT>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">LOS ANGELES</ENAMEX>  &MD;  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timothy Leary</ENAMEX>, the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ivy League</ENAMEX> professor and
LSD guru who dabbled heavily in cyberspace as an elder statesman of
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">'60s</TIMEX> counterculture, died at his home after an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18-month</TIMEX> bout
with cancer. He was 75.
<p>
   But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leary</ENAMEX>'s death <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early Friday</TIMEX>, announced on his Internet home
page and videotaped by friends and family assembled at his bedside,
will not end the ex-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> psychologist's lifelong pursuit of the
ultimate cosmic experience.
<p>
   Loved ones have arranged to have a quarter-ounce of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leary</ENAMEX>'s
cremated remains tucked into a satellite and blasted into orbit by
a Pegasus rocket <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this fall</TIMEX> as part of the world's first burial in
space.
<p>
   If all goes as planned, his ashes will eventually burn up in the
atmosphere with the satellite when it falls back to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>, a
fitting final act of hyperbole for the firebrand who shocked the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960s</TIMEX> establishment by advocating the use of mind-altering drugs
and exhorting a generation of young people to ``turn on, tune in
and drop out.''
<p>
   ``That's his style. He wanted to go out with a bang,'' said
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leary</ENAMEX>'s stepson, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zachary Leary</ENAMEX>, 22, outside the hilltop home he
shared with his father. ``He really always thought space was the
final frontier.''
<p>
   ``I think he'd like to be remembered as a philosopher, and as a
champion of the human mind and the human spirit,'' his stepson
added. ``He was all about the mind.''
<p>
   He said part of his stepfather's final mission was to use his
terminal illness to tear down the taboos surrounding death.
<p>
   ``He really made sure that we knew that the mystery of death is
as beautiful as the mystery of life,'' the younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leary</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leary</ENAMEX>, who married five times and also leaves a son named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack</ENAMEX>,
was diagnosed with prostate cancer in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1995</TIMEX> and in recent
months had mused about the possibility of committing a public
suicide over the Internet.
<p>
   But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zachary Leary</ENAMEX> said his father and friends decided
``communally'' not to go through with his idea of because of legal
complications and because ``it would have been very difficult for
us.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leary</ENAMEX>'s homepage on the World Wide Web said in a brief
announcement of his death: ``Just after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight</TIMEX>, in his favorite
bed among loving friends, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timothy Leary</ENAMEX> peacefully passed on. His
last words were `why not?' and `yeah.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zachary Leary</ENAMEX> said the final word his father actually uttered
was, ``beautiful.''
<p>
   ``I told him I loved him and he smiled,'' his son recalled. ``He
just slipped away very peacefully.''
<p>
   He said a hospice nurse at his bedside pronounced <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leary</ENAMEX> dead at
about <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12:45 a.m.</TIMEX>
<p>
   ``I had my finger on the pulse of his neck and felt it
disappearing,'' said longtime friend <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carol Rosin</ENAMEX>, 52, another one
of about a dozen close companions and family members with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leary</ENAMEX>
when he died.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winona Ryder</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leary</ENAMEX>'s goddaughter, issued a statement through
her publicist.
<p>
   ``One of the gazillion ... things I learned from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim</ENAMEX> in my <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24
years</TIMEX> of knowing him, and particularly during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="last few months">these last few
months</TIMEX>, is how noble, beautiful and funny a person can be when
faced with death. It made me less afraid. I was glad to be there
with him to say goodbye.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zachary Leary</ENAMEX> said his father's final days, including his death,
were chronicled on videotape. He said no decision had been made
about what to do with the footage, but ``there will probably be a
tie-in with the Internet site.''
<p>
   ``It was his dream to keep his Internet site alive,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zachary
Leary</ENAMEX> said. ``That's really the ultimate form of immortality for
him.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zachary Leary</ENAMEX> said a wake will be held for close friends and
family, but the only other ceremony planned is the lofting of a
portion of his stepfather's cremated remains into orbit.
<p>
   That mission will be carried out by a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two-year</TIMEX>-old <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX>-based
company called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celestis Inc.</ENAMEX>, which offers to orbit the ashes
of the dearly departed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4,800</NUMEX> a trip under contract with the
private space launch contractor, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Orbital Sciences Corp.</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dulles</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Va.</ENAMEX>
<p>
   For the company's first such trip in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>, a satellite
bearing the ashes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leary</ENAMEX>, the late ``Star Trek'' creator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene
Rodenberry</ENAMEX> and about two dozen others will be lifted into space by
a Pegasus rocket launched from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed</ENAMEX> L-1011 aircraft at high
altitude, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celestis</ENAMEX> vice president <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Gartner</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zachary Leary</ENAMEX> said he and a group of about 20 others who were in
the house <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> contacted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leary</ENAMEX>'s more distant friends and
family as it became clear <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> that the end was near.
<p>
   Among those who called to say a final farewell were Beat
Generation writer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Borroughs</ENAMEX>, and author <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken Kesey</ENAMEX>, best
known for his novel ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zachary
Leary</ENAMEX> said.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 3</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- European satellite launch group
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arianespace</ENAMEX> is scheduled <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> to send up its first <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ariane</ENAMEX> 5
rocket, one capable of sending into orbit loads <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 percent</NUMEX> heavier
than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ariane</ENAMEX> 4.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ariane</ENAMEX> 5 launch, scheduled for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">noon, Paris time,</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">French
Guyana</ENAMEX> near the equator, will send up four <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Space Agency</ENAMEX>
Cluster satellites to study interactions between the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">sun</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The mission had originally been scheduled for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last November</TIMEX> but
has been put off numerous times.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arianespace</ENAMEX>, a group of 53 European aerospace and defense
companies that builds rockets to launch telecommunications and
scientific satellites, has promised that launch costs will be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10
percent</NUMEX> lower than with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ariane</ENAMEX> 4.
<p>
   With a claim on <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 percent</NUMEX> of the world's satellite launching
business, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arianespace</ENAMEX> has said it is counting on the new rocket to
maintain its position in the industry.
<p>
   The group was the first to launch commercial payloads regularly.
Competition has grown in recent years, however, as the explosion of
telecommunications services has multiplied the need for launches.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed Martin Corp.</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ariane</ENAMEX>'s biggest rival. The Russians
and Chinese also have started becoming significant competitors.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">India</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> have launching facilities, but send up smaller
payloads than those put into geostationary orbit by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ariane</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arianespace</ENAMEX> is predicting a big upturn in the demand for
launchers. Up to 35 satellites a year could be sent into orbit
within the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next 10 to 15 years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arianespace</ENAMEX> estimates. Those
figures, published <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX>, represent an increase from
the company's old estimate of about 25 launches a year.
<p>
   Since its inception, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arianespace</ENAMEX> has signed 159 launch contracts
and successfully placed into orbit 112 large satellites for
commercial, international and government organizations, and 26
auxiliary payloads for experimental purposes.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arianespace</ENAMEX> now has a backlog of 44 satellites on order to be
launched.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">ATLANTA</ENAMEX>  &MD;  With roads in possible gridlock during the Olympics,
helicopters could be the saving grace for people who need immediate
medical attention or a critical business delivery.
<p>
   But how to prevent sky-lock, given the swarm of helicopters
expected, possibly several times the 74 copters normally stationed
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>?
<p>
   A federal demonstration project could help transportation
officials get a handle on at least some of them by using global
positioning satellite navigation and something like airborne e-mail
to guide emergency and special cargo copters.
<p>
   The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10 million</NUMEX> project unveiled <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> and paid for by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> and private companies
will keep track of 50 choppers. About half of them will be under
the control of emergency officials. Others agencies and businesses
with time-sensitive deliveries, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Express</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The
Atlanta Journal- Constitution</ENAMEX>, also will participate.
<p>
   ``This is an important experiment,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> administrator
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Hinson</ENAMEX>. The project marks the first attempt to coordinate
helicopter movements in the crowded skies above a dense urban area,
he said.
<p>
   At monitoring stations at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dobbins Air Force Base</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia
Emergency Management Association</ENAMEX> downtown, a computer will show a
map of metro <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> and its interstate highway system. Cockpit
displays in the helicopter will show pilots what the weather and
other air traffic looks like. .

EUROPEAN ROCKET BLOWN UP ON MAIDEN FLIGHT

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">PARIS</ENAMEX>  &MD;  A huge new rocket that had been intended to put <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>
further ahead of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> in the world commercial
satellite-launching market had to be blown up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">40 seconds</TIMEX>
into its maiden flight, after it veered from its trajectory.
<p>
   Stunned technicians and invited guests at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Space
Agency</ENAMEX>'s launch center at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kourou</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">French Guiana</ENAMEX>, watched pieces of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ariane</ENAMEX> 5 rocket rain down in flames from 13,120 feet, where the
self-destruct mechanism exploded it on a command from the ground.
<p>
   ``Of course it's a disappointment, but we have to bounce back,''
said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claude Bigot</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arianespace</ENAMEX>, the commercial arm of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Space Agency</ENAMEX>, which had spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$7 billion</NUMEX>
to develop the new launcher. No one was hurt, according to the
agency, but four uninsured science satellites the rocket was to
carry into space were lost.
<p>
   The two-stage rocket, with two solid-fuel boosters strapped to
its side much like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s space shuttle, was designed to be the
successor to the highly successful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ariane</ENAMEX> 4, which launched 12 out
of the 26 nonmilitary satellites that various countries sent into
orbit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>, its space program long hampered by the
Challenger space shuttle disaster in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>, launched nine commercial
satellites <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>, according to European figures.
<p>
   Whether <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>'s accident would represent a so serious a
setback for the European space program was not clear.
<p>
   But French television commentators watching the launch live on
television in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> looked as dejected as their American
counterparts did almost <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40 years ago</TIMEX>, when Soviet rockets were
sending Sputniks into space while American ones repeatedly blew up
on the launch pad.
<p>
   For <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>, which views the European program with a proprietary
air, the failure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> was an embarrassing setback. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arianespace</ENAMEX>
had been so confident of success that it forecast the new rocket's
expected launch reliability at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98.5 percent</NUMEX> and offered a free
repeat launch to customers in the unlikely event of failure.
<p>
   Through its smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ariane</ENAMEX> 4 single-stage rockets, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arianespace</ENAMEX>,
a partnership of 40 European aerospace companies led by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" MIN="Aerospatiale">Aerospatiale of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX></ENAMEX> and the French space agency, now controls
about <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 percent</NUMEX> of the world's commercial launch market and takes
in about <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1 billion</NUMEX> a year.
<p>
   The Atlas rocket produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed Martin</ENAMEX> is the main
American commercial launcher, and together with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonnell
Douglas</ENAMEX> medium-sized Delta, had less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 percent</NUMEX> of advance
orders <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>. The Russian <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proton</ENAMEX> and the Chinese Long March
rockets have the rest.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bigot</ENAMEX>, the president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arianespace</ENAMEX>, said that an investigation
into what went wrong would be completed by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-July</TIMEX>. Originally,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European space agency</ENAMEX> planned two <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ariane</ENAMEX> 5 launches <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>,
three in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, four in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> and five or six in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>. Fourteen of
the new launchers are on order.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis Avanzi</ENAMEX>, general manager of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arianespace</ENAMEX>, told the
newspaper Le Monde on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> that the consortium planned to keep
using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ariane</ENAMEX> 4 until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> and then carry out seven or eight
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ariane</ENAMEX> 5 launches a year after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">turn of the century</TIMEX>, lofting
several satellites at a time. The American Atlas rocket, by
contrast, usually can carry only one.
<p>
   He said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ariane</ENAMEX> 5 was capable of putting 7.6 tons into
the orbit used by telecommunications satellites with a single-phase
launch and 6.58 tons, employing a two-phase launch. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">After 2003</TIMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ariane</ENAMEX> 5 would be able to lift 8.16 tons into orbit.
<p>
   ``We are the only ones on the market with these dimensions,'' he
said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arianespace</ENAMEX> calculated the commercial market at 200 to 240
satellites over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next eight years</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 percent</NUMEX> of them for
telecommunications.
<p>
   French <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Space and Telecommunications</ENAMEX> Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francois Fillon</ENAMEX>,
who watched the launch attempt from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louvre</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>, said: ``It
was an experimental flight. We knew the risks we were running. We
will do all we can to insure that the great European space
adventure remains a success.''
<p>
   Officials of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arianespace</ENAMEX> said the 87th satellite launch of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ariane</ENAMEX> 4 would take place <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="eight days">in eight days</TIMEX>, the first of eight more
scheduled <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 5</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Wall Industry Corp.</ENAMEX>
officials say <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s next satellite launch is being held up by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> government.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> is delaying the release of an international review
examining the reasons for a rocket failure in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sun
Shaolin</ENAMEX>, director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Wall</ENAMEX>'s information office.
<p>
   ``The review was to have been released on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 10</TIMEX> so that
insurers could get more information (about the failed launch),''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sun</ENAMEX> said. ``However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> government suddenly said it wanted to
examine the report before it is released.''
<p>
   Insurers have said they will not underwrite <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s next launch
until they receive a report on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>'s explosion of a Long March
3B rocket.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Embassy</ENAMEX> officials contacted said they were not aware of the
delay.
<p>
   An official with leading reinsurer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson and Higgens</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> said he had ``heard something like that,'' regarding the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> government blocking the report's release.
<p>
   One embassy official said the delay might be caused by questions
of technology transfer.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> government lays down strict rules on the transfer of
satellite and aerospace technology to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Jefferies</ENAMEX>
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>-based Asia-Pacific Space Report.
<p>
   Since the review is examining the rocket launch, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> may
be concerned that an international study could contain information
aiding <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s launch industry, in the process helping the
country's improve its missile launch reliability.
<p>
   In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>, a Chinese-made Long March 3B rocket carrying an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelsat</ENAMEX> satellite exploded seconds after lift-off from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Xichang</ENAMEX>
rocket base in southwest <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>. Early studies indicated a faulty
guidance system caused the rocket failure.
<p>
   The review committee set up in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> to boost the confidence of
the insurance community is headed by Dr <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wah L. Lim</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>-based
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loral Corp.</ENAMEX>'s space systems division.
<p>
   The next proposed launch by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes</ENAMEX>-built satellite
for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APT Satellite Co.</ENAMEX> on a Long March 3 rocket, a
smaller version of the failed Long March 3B.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APT Satellite Co.</ENAMEX>'s shareholders include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Singapore Telecom</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Thailand</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charoen Pokhpand Group</ENAMEX> and commercial arms of the
Chinese army, space and telecommunications authorities.
<p>
   ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Wall</ENAMEX> is very anxious to resume launching,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sun</ENAMEX>.
``The Apstar-1A is already in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Xichang</ENAMEX>. Without the release of the
report, insurers are unwilling to go ahead with the launch.''
<p>
   Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Wall</ENAMEX> is yet to receive the international
committee's findings, the company is confident that the review
backs their own findings.
<p>
   ``We are sure of the cause of the failure,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sun</ENAMEX> said. ``The
report of the independent review committee will give a more
detailed conclusion.''
<p>
   In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Wall</ENAMEX>'s parent, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China Aerospace Corp.</ENAMEX> said
initial results of the investigation into the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX> failure
published by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China Great Wall</ENAMEX> indicated a faulty gyroscope system,
called the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU).
<p>
   The unit sent the wrong signals to the rocket's movable exhaust
nozzles, changing their angles and tilting the rocket's trajectory.
<p>
   The independent review confirmed that the problem is isolated to
the Long March 3B rocket and is not connected to the Long March 3
version set to carry the Apstar-1A satellite into space, an
industry analyst said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> is anxious to resume its satellite launches. The Apstar-1A
was originally to have been launched in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX>, with as many as four
more satellites to be launched <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The other launches include the launch of a Chinese-made
DongFangHong3 satellite on a Long March 3A, originally set for
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> but now postponed.
<p>
   In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>, a Long March 3 rocket was scheduled to carry a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ChinaSat</ENAMEX>-7 communications satellite for a Chinese controlled
company. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes</ENAMEX> will build the satellite.
<p>
   In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> had planned to launch a recoverable spy
satellite aboard a Long March 2-C rocket from its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jiuquan</ENAMEX> launch
base in northern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gansu</ENAMEX> province.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Later in the year</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> hopes to win a bid to launch the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mabuhay</ENAMEX> communications satellite for a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manila</ENAMEX>-based consortium led
by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co.</ENAMEX> The satellite is to be
supplied by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loral Corp.</ENAMEX>, the company which made the
satellite destroyed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb. 15</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Wall</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sun</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>'s failure of the European-backed
Ariane 5 rocket on its maiden flight would have little effect on
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s satellite program.
<p>
   ``In any scientific experiment, failures are always possible,''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sun</ENAMEX> said. ``We don't think the failure will promote or negatively
affect the business of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Wall</ENAMEX>.''

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 10</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> will resume its commercial
space program in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX> after international insurers agreed to
underwrite the next launch, said a spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s rocket

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s satellite program has been held up since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX> when a
Long March 3B rocket carrying an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelsat</ENAMEX> satellite exploded
seconds after take-off from southwest <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Xichang</ENAMEX> space base.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Munich Re</ENAMEX>, the world's biggest reinsurer, will lead the
international group of companies backing the launch of the
Apstar-1A satellite owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APT Satellite Co.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APT</ENAMEX>'s shareholders
include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Singapore Telecom</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Thailand</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charoen Pokhpand Group</ENAMEX> and
commercial arms of the Chinese army, space and telecommunications
authorities.
<p>
   The launch ``was insured <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last Saturday</TIMEX> and is likely to be
launched in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early July</TIMEX>,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Wall</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ma Qimin</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freeman Zhang</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX>-based official with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson and
Higgens</ENAMEX>, an international reinsurance company, said ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Munich Re</ENAMEX> is
the leading reinsurer.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Munich Re</ENAMEX> is formally known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Muenchener
Rueckversicherungs-Gesellschaft</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The satellite is made by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" MIN="Hughes Space and Communications">Hughes Space and Communications
division</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX> It's already been delivered to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Xichang</ENAMEX> launch site. It will go up on a Long March 3 rocket.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Wall</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ma</ENAMEX> said insurers backed the launch before receiving
a full report of an international committee set up to review
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s own analysis of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX> failure.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> charges the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> government is holding up the report's
release. The review committee, set up in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> to boost the
confidence of the insurance community, was headed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wah L. Lim</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loral Corp.</ENAMEX>'s space systems division.
<p>
   ``You can read this to mean that insurance companies support the
conclusions of our investigations,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ma</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Wall</ENAMEX>'s parent, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China Aerospace Corp.</ENAMEX> said in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX> failure was caused by a faulty gyroscope system, called
the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU).
<p>
   The unit sent the wrong signals to the rocket's movable exhaust
nozzles, changing their angles and tilting the rocket's trajectory.
<p>
   ``We tried to explain to insurers that the Long March 3B is
different from the Long March 3,'' said Professor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bao Miaoqin</ENAMEX>, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX>-based engineer with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APT Satellite Co.</ENAMEX> ``It looks like they
have accepted the arguments.'' The Long March 3 has a launch
capacity of about 1450 kilograms, compared to the 4800 kilogram
capacity of the Long March 3B
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bao</ENAMEX> said the company will pay the premium rate insurers offered
before the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX> explosion. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bao</ENAMEX> declined to disclose the premium
rate. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Shanghai</ENAMEX>-based state-owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China Pacific
Insurance Co.</ENAMEX> agreed to insure the Apstar-1A satellite for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.3
billion yuan</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$280 million</NUMEX>).
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Wall</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ma</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> will reschedule the rest of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this
year</TIMEX>'s launches after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APT</ENAMEX> launch.
<p>
   Other launches planned for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later this year</TIMEX> include the
DongFangHong3 satellite on a Long March 3A.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> has also earmarked a Long March 3 rocket to carry a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ChinaSat</ENAMEX>-7 communications satellite for a Chinese controlled
company. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes</ENAMEX> will build the satellite.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Radio, Film and Television Ministry</ENAMEX> is particularly
anxious for a speedy launch of the ChinaSat7, analysts said. Much
of the nation's television signals are being beamed from ChinaSat5,
an aging satellite nearing the end of its usable life.
<p>
   The shortest span between launches in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> is about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50 days</TIMEX>.

<p>
   So it was only fitting that the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">500th anniversary</TIMEX> celebration in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Columbus</ENAMEX>' voyage to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX> brought the foundation close to
launching its sail.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christopher Columbus Quincentenary Jubilee Commission</ENAMEX> seized
on the romance and historic symbolism of a sail race to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX>. A
panel of experts was authorized to choose three groups: one from
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>, one from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>, which was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Columbus</ENAMEX>' intended destination,
and another from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, his home port.
<p>
   To represent <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>, the foundation's ship was selected and
given the name the ``Nina.'' Other ships would be call the
``Pinta'' and ``Santa Maria.''
<p>
   With a sail 180 feet on each side, the foundation's vessel was
to be launched atop a rocket and set free. Its sail would unfurl
and then ride solar waves to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX>  &MD;  and back, to be reused
continually.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LaBombard</ENAMEX>, who retired from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonnel Douglas</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45 years</TIMEX> of
helping to design its first airplanes, said the solar-sail concept
is revolutionary in its simplicity and efficiency.
<p>
   ``It was a gadget that can go anywhere with zero fuel and be
controlled from the ground and go on and on forever. Go anywhere
and come back. Go there again,'' he said.
<p>
   When the commission chairman resigned abruptly, however, the
race to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX> lost momentum and more important  &MD;  financing.
<p>
   ``One of the most unfortunate things about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Space
Foundation</ENAMEX>,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LaBombard</ENAMEX> said, ``is their timing for everything has
been absolutely no good.'
<p>
   During the early, success-flush days of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s space shuttle,
the foundation managed to win a contract to launch not one but two
sails into space as part of a program for non-government
experiments.
<p>
   Then the shuttle Challenger exploded, and the foundation lost
its ride into space.
<p>
   Undaunted, the foundation and teams from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> joined
to promote what would be a race to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">moon</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>  &MD;  dubbed the
Luna Cup. A <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> public relations firm drew up a
black-covered booklet, complete with glossy pictures of solar sails
and an explanation of their need for money.
<p>
   Several corporations, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E.I. Dupont de Nemours Co.</ENAMEX> and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thiokol Corp.</ENAMEX>, agreed to provide materials and expertise. But
the foundation failed to raise enough other support, and then the
aerospace industry soured.
<p>
   ``They began looking at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next years</TIMEX> bottom line and it slowed
down considerably,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LaBombard</ENAMEX> said. ``And then the whole thing
slowed way down.''
<p>
   Now a spacecraft mock-up sits idle in the workshop. The
custom-made sail-cutting machine is covered in plastic.
<p>
   Piled high in the foundation's office are handwritten letters
with checks from people who want the nonprofit group to launch its
sail. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</TIMEX>, thousands of people have donated to the
space-sail project, among them <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis Wilson</ENAMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">72-year</TIMEX>-old <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lompoc</ENAMEX>
man who believes humankind's survival is written in the stars.
<p>
   ``It is the last frontier,'' he said. ``The only thing that has
kept man going on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> is they have always had a frontier.''

through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s on-line computer service, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>
Network, which also provides access to the global computer network
known as the Internet.
<p>
   The three companies will invest a total of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1 billion yen</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$9.1
million</NUMEX>) in the venture, which will be formed by the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">end of this
year</TIMEX> and begin offering services by the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">middle of next year</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nintendo</ENAMEX> will put up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 percent</NUMEX> of the initial investment, while
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nomura</ENAMEX> will put up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 percent</NUMEX> each.
<p>
   The service, which will be limited to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, will be offered to
subscribing members. Users will install a satellite modem to read
data into a personal computer utilizing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX>'s Windows
operating system.
<p>
   ``This venture draws on the strengths of all three companies,''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Gates</ENAMEX>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> said
at a press conference.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nintendo</ENAMEX> will develop the satellite modem and the software for
the service. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> will manage membership and provide modem
support with Windows. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nomura</ENAMEX>, the research arm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nomura Securities
Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s largest brokerage, will oversee the entire system.
<p>
   Subscription rates are estimated to be about <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,000 yen</NUMEX> a month,
or about <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$9.17</NUMEX>, company officials said.
<p>
   ``We want to create something totally new,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hiroshi
Yamauchi</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nintendo</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Once undisputed king of video game makers, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nintendo</ENAMEX> is facing
increasingly stiff competition from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sega Enterprises
Ltd.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nintendo</ENAMEX>'s sales fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14.8 percent</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sega</ENAMEX>'s
rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.9 percent</NUMEX>.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This past Sunday</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nintendo</ENAMEX> released its newest game machine, a
64-bit player the company has billed as state-of-the-art. That move
was meant to leapfrog <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sega</ENAMEX>, which released 32-bit game
machines that were faster and more powerful that what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nintendo</ENAMEX> was
offering.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sega Enterprises Ltd.</ENAMEX> has said it will sell products allowing
users of its Saturn video game player to dial into the Internet
network, in what could be the first step towards worldwide
interactive video games.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sega</ENAMEX> sells a modem and software that will allow Saturn users to
dial into the computer network from their home television sets
without the need to buy a personal computer.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sega</ENAMEX> is already making some of its games available for computer
users to take advantage of a growing demand for computers, and has
started tests of a cable television game channel that allows users
to dial up games they want from their television.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nintendo</ENAMEX> share rose as much as <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">150 yen</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8250</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsoft</ENAMEX> shares
fell 2 1/8 in trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>, to 122. Shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nomura
Securities Co.</ENAMEX>, the parent company of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nomura Research</ENAMEX>, rose as much
as <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 yen</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2,170</NUMEX>.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 2</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> plans to send a satellite
into orbit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>, reigniting its commercial-space program
nearly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five months</TIMEX> after its last launch ended in an explosion
shortly after take-off.
<p>
   The launch comes at a crucial time for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s space program.
After two spectacular failures the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past two years</TIMEX>, it's now facing
increased competition from Russian and European rockets.
<p>
   In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>'s launch, a Long March 3 rocket will carry an
Apstar-1A satellite for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APT Satellite Co.</ENAMEX>, whose shareholders
include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Singapore Telecom</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Thailand</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charoen Pokphand Group</ENAMEX> and
commercial arms of the Chinese army, space and telecommunications
authorities.
<p>
   The satellite was built was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes Space and Communications Co.</ENAMEX>,
a division of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors Co.</ENAMEX>
<p>
   ``The rocket is scheduled to blast off at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6:46 p.m.</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX>,
weather permitting,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ma Qimin</ENAMEX>, a spokesman for launch-service
operator <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China Great Wall Industry Corp.</ENAMEX> ``The launch will not be
televised.''
<p>
   Officials at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APT Satellite Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX>
confirmed the launch plans.
<p>
   The launch got the go-ahead from international insurers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last
month</TIMEX> after they reviewed an analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX> launch
failure.
<p>
   Officials from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APT</ENAMEX> are now at the launch site in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Xichang</ENAMEX>, in the southwestern Chinese province of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sichuan</ENAMEX>.

<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" MIN="Lockheed Martin">Lockheed Martin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skunk Works</ENAMEX></ENAMEX> will lead a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1 billion</NUMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>-financed effort to develop a revolutionary, reusable rocket to
replace the space shuttle in the fight to regain <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> pre-eminence
in the global commercial launch market.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Palmdale</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>-based company, which earned belated
recognition for its clandestine Cold War development of
high-altitude spy planes, snared the project from competitors
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonnell Douglas Aerospace</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell International</ENAMEX>, both also
based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skunk Works</ENAMEX> division of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed Martin</ENAMEX>
takes its name from the ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li'l Abner</ENAMEX>'' comic strip.
<p>
   ``This is the craft that can carry <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>'s dreams aloft and
launch our nation into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a sparkling new century</TIMEX>,'' Vice President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al
Gore</ENAMEX> told the audience gathered for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>'s announcement at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ENAMEX> in suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Under terms of the agreement with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Aeronautics and
Space Administration</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed Martin</ENAMEX> will design and fabricate a
single test craft  &MD;  called the X-33 by the space agency and
VentureStar by its design team. Shaped like a fat arrowhead, the
67-foot-tall, 68-foot-wide spacecraft will undergo a series of
increasingly ambitious suborbital test flights in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, most likely
launching from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Edwards Air Force Base</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marshall Space Flight Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Huntsville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ala.</ENAMEX>, will
manage the project for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The space agency's commitment of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1 billion</NUMEX> to the project will
be supplemented by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$220 million</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed Martin</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Once flight test evaluations of the X-33 are complete, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White
House</ENAMEX>-level policy decision will be made on whether to proceed
toward the development of a much larger spacecraft, 125 feet tall.
<p>
   The single-stage, reusable launch vehicle will cost an estimated
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5 billion to $10 billion</NUMEX>.
<p>
   As envisioned, the vehicle's development cost would be borne
largely by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed Martin</ENAMEX>. The spacecraft would be used to launch
government cargo to the planned <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>-led international space
station, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Defense</ENAMEX> cargo and privately owned
communications and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>-observing satellites.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> Administrator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dan Goldin</ENAMEX> said his agency expects to respond
to declining budgets by contracting for its space flights rather
than operating its own fleet of space shuttles, which now cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3.2
billion</NUMEX> annually.
<p>
   ``This is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an historic day</TIMEX> for the space program,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldin</ENAMEX> said.
``Now, we fly dozens of astronauts a year. This vehicle should
allow hundreds of you to fly, and vehicles that come behind should
allow thousands to fly.''
<p>
   The space shuttle, designed a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter century ago</TIMEX>, represents
the most recent <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> effort to develop a new rocket. The country's
fleet of expendable Atlas and Delta rockets trace their lineage to
early ballistic missiles.
<p>
   The combination of aging technologies and a national policy that
until the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX> Challenger disaster restricted all satellite
launches to the shuttle has allowed French <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ariane</ENAMEX> and, more
recently, Russian rockets to win more than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 percent</NUMEX> of the
lucrative global commercial launch market.
<p>
   The goal of the new vessel is to lower the cost of launching
cargo to orbit from about <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10,000</NUMEX> a pound aboard the shuttle to
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,000</NUMEX> or less through the use of tougher, lighter materials in the
airframe, propellant tanks and outer surfaces of the spacecraft.
None of the vehicle's components would fall away during ascent as
do the solid rocket boosters and external fuel tank of the current
shuttle.
<p>
   The new spacecraft would be designed for airliner-like ground
operations, so back-to-back flights could occur days instead of
several months apart, as they do with the shuttle. A ground team of
a few dozen people could prepare, launch and fly the new rocket
instead of the hundreds required by the shuttle.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed Martin</ENAMEX>'s spacecraft will launch vertically and land
horizontally on a runway. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX>'s proposal, which resembled a
winged shuttle, did the same.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonnell Douglas</ENAMEX>' proposal resembled the vertical take-off and
landing craft that has undergone a series of subsonic, low-altitude
tests at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">White Sands Missile Range</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Mexico</ENAMEX> since
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 3</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> government expects to
approve a new media law by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>, which will loosen some media
cross-ownership rules, after opposition to continued ownership
rules and access to all for digital TV was defeated <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Once approved, the new law is likely to prompt takeovers and
mergers of commercial TV companies <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this fall</TIMEX>, analysts said.
<p>
   Moves to loosen cross-ownership rules further have created
volatility in the shares of small commercial TV companies,
including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yorkshire Tyne-Tees Holdings Plc</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HTV Group Plc</ENAMEX>, as
speculation grows that they will become takeover targets once the
bill is approved.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yorkshire Tyne-Tees</ENAMEX>' shares fell as much as <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3 pence</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1235p</NUMEX>
after closing up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 percent</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> and rising <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 percent</NUMEX> in the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HTV</ENAMEX>'s shares rose as much as <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7 pence</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">336p</NUMEX> after
rising <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 percent</NUMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scottish Television</ENAMEX>'s shares
were unchanged after falling <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 percent</NUMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6
percent</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last two weeks</TIMEX>. The new rules will not come into
effect until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Stevenson</ENAMEX>, a spokesman for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of National Heritage</ENAMEX>. He said the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> government
succeeded <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX> in quashing attempts to prevent certain
companies, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rupert Murdoch</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp</ENAMEX>, which owns <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40
percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc</ENAMEX>, from winning
licenses for digital TV.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSkyB</ENAMEX> has the only satellite TV license in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> at present.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital TV</ENAMEX> is expected to start as soon as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Under consideration for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 18 months</TIMEX>, the broadcasting
bill shifts regulation from the number of media franchises a
company may hold to a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 percent</NUMEX> total audience share.
<p>
   A key change is that commercial TV companies, called Channel 3,
may now own as many franchises as they like provided they don't
cross the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 percent</NUMEX> total audience share in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> At the
moment, they are permitted to own up to two TV franchises.
<p>
   In anticipation of its approval, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAI Group Plc</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United News &AMP;
Media Plc</ENAMEX> have already merged to form a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.3 billion pound</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5
billion</NUMEX>) company. To stay within existing rules, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United News</ENAMEX> put
some of its newspaper assets into a separate company.
<p>
   However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSkyB</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News International</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British
Telecommunications Plc</ENAMEX>, which dwarf most <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> media companies,
could each have a share in operating digital television multiplexer
licenses and a share in the transmission of digital channels.
<p>
   Analysts said the new rules risk being overtaken by the flood of
rights agreements signed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX> and a handful of other
companies, to buy up sports and movie programs around the world,
including in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX>
<p>
   They recalled the fate of rules the government put in place in
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980s</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Satellite Broadcasting</ENAMEX> to operate a British
satellite TV service. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murdoch</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sky Broadcasting</ENAMEX> launched a
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> service from a satellite over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Luxembourg</ENAMEX>, the rules became
superfluous. The result was that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sky</ENAMEX> merged with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSkyB</ENAMEX> to form
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc</ENAMEX>, which now has a monopoly on
satellite TV in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX>
<p>
   At present, companies' control of the market is measured by the
number of franchises they hold.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada Group Plc</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> it would like to buy
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yorkshire-Tyne</ENAMEX> because it is located next to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manchester</ENAMEX>
region franchise. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX> now owns <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23 percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yorkshire
Tyne-Tees</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Independent Television Commission</ENAMEX>, the industry regulator,
said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Granada</ENAMEX> has a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.2 percent</NUMEX> share of total TV audience in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX>, so it could now buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yorkshire-Tyne</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   In addition to being able to own more than two independent TV
franchises, Channel 3 companies may now own cable TV services in
the areas they cover.
<p>
   Local newspapers with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 20 percent and less than 50
percent</NUMEX> of local circulation can buy up to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 percent</NUMEX> of the local
radio audience.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 3</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> administration is
urging regulators to hold off approval of a plan by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tele-Communications Inc.</ENAMEX> affiliate and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TelQuest Ventures LLC</ENAMEX> to use
Canadian satellites to beam cable TV shows to American viewers.
<p>
   The unusual recommendation, in a letter from four executive
branch agencies to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Communications Commission</ENAMEX>, stems in
part from concerns that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> continues to restrict <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> satellite
services and television programming.
<p>
   The administration's recommendation, though not binding on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> as an independent agency, represents ``the death knell'' for
the venture, said a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> communications lawyer who until
recently headed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> bureau that is reviewing the application.
<p>
   The letter from the four agencies -- the departments of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> Trade Representative's office
--``is something that happens only rarely'' in pending applications
before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX>'s international bureau, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Blake Harris</ENAMEX>, who
headed the bureau until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-May</TIMEX>.
<p>
   It means ``this administration is serious about getting equal
opportunities for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> companies. The executive branch is sending a
very clear signal,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harris</ENAMEX>, who is now a partner with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> law firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gibson, Dunn &AMP; Crutcher LLP</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   In the letter, the four executive branch departments urge the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> to wait until they know under what terms the Canadian
government authorizes the arrangement.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> is still reviewing the application.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harris</ENAMEX>, free now to discuss <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> business, said it is
``inconceivable'' that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> would grant the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCI</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TelQuest</ENAMEX> request
since equal opportunities do not exist for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> companies wishing
to beam to Canadian audiences.
<p>
   The executive branch letter ``clinches it,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harris</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX>'s international bureau now will ``simply deny'' the
application, he predicted.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> is currently set to make a decision on the application
by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 15</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">That date</TIMEX> was requested by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TelQuest</ENAMEX> because it
gives them time to make their launch date if the agency approves
their request. ``I believe I'll be able to tell them by then,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX>
international bureau chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Gips</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gips</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX>
will consider the executive agencies' letter but is restricted from
commenting substantively on the matter.
<p>
   The executive branch concerns come as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> considers whether
to let <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western Tele-Communications Inc.</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCI</ENAMEX> affiliate, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TelQuest</ENAMEX> use two satellites owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ottawa</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TeleSat Canada</ENAMEX> to
beam subscription video services into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCI</ENAMEX>-led <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Primestar
Partners</ENAMEX> has also informally agreed to join the venture.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCI</ENAMEX> shares were up 1/8 at 18 at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCI</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>'s biggest cable TV company, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TelQuest</ENAMEX> is
controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jared E. Abbruzzese</ENAMEX>, the chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAI Wireless
Systems</ENAMEX>, a wireless cable company in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell Atlantic Corp.</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nynex</ENAMEX> have an option to buy a stake. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Primestar</ENAMEX>'s partners include
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time Warner Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cox Communications Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comcast Corp.</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Continental Cablevision</ENAMEX>, among others.
<p>
   In their letter, the executive branch agencies expressed concern
over Canadian restrictions on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> companies, as well as
international agreement obligations that would require modification
if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCI</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TelQuest</ENAMEX> application were approved.
<p>
   ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> discriminates against <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and other foreign
programmers and service providers in a number of ways,'' the letter
said, including ``extensive content restrictions'' on TV and cable
broadcasting, the letter said. Also, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> restricts <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
satellite, telephone and broadcasting services, the agencies said.
<p>
   International agreements between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> would need
to be modified before a Canadian satellite could beam TV shows into
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>, the agencies said. Also, the agencies said there is
``some concern'' that ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCI</ENAMEX>, given its market position, may have an
incentive to engage in anti-competitive behavior in parts of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> market.''
<p>
   The letter, dated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1</TIMEX>, was signed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vonya McCann</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
coordinator for international communications and information policy
at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Lang</ENAMEX>, deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> trade
representative; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Turetsky</ENAMEX>, deputy assistant attorney general
in the antitrust division at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry
Irving</ENAMEX>, assistant secretary for communications and information at
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce Department</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rupert Murdoch</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI Communications Corp.</ENAMEX> have
also asked the agency to block the companies' request. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News Corp.</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX> together paid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$682 million</NUMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> direct broadcast
satellite license. Their joint venture, called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Sky
Broadcasting</ENAMEX>, argued to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCC</ENAMEX> that it would be unfair for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCI</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TelQuest</ENAMEX> to circumvent the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> auction and licensing process by
going to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX> for the needed satellite slot.
<p>
   Also, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Sky</ENAMEX> said it would be unfair to give a Canadian
satellite free access to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> customers unless reciprocal
opportunities existed for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> satellites beaming to Canadian
customers -- which they don't.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomberg LP</ENAMEX>, the parent company of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomberg Business News</ENAMEX>
provides news and programming to subscribers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DirecTV</ENAMEX>, another

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 4</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rocket Systems Corp.</ENAMEX> is
close to signing a deal worth about <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$8 billion</NUMEX> to launch more than
10 satellites for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes Space and Communications International</ENAMEX>, a
unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes Electronics Corp.</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
<p>
   Success of the deal will mark <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s entry into the commercial
satellite launch business around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the turn of the century</TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``We've reached agreement on basic conditions for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSC</ENAMEX> launching
the satellites for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes</ENAMEX>. We expect to sign a formal contract by
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of August</TIMEX>,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hiroshi Imamura</ENAMEX>, executive vice president
overseeing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSC</ENAMEX>'s commercial launch service.
<p>
   The basic conditions cover the number of satellites, cost,
options, penalties and insurance of the launches, he said, adding
there are still several details to be worked out.
<p>
   Under the agreement, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSC</ENAMEX> will launch more than 10 satellites for
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes</ENAMEX> using the H2A rocket. It is being developed by Japanese
companies and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Space Development Agency</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s
version of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>, in a national effort to provide an inexpensive,
commercial version of the current H2 rockets.
<p>
   Each launch on the H2A will cost around <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8.5 billion yen</NUMEX>,
bringing the total value of the deal to more than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">850 billion yen</NUMEX>
(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$7.73 billion</NUMEX>).
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSC</ENAMEX> plans to launch two <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes</ENAMEX> satellites a year once initial
test launches of the H2A rockets are completed around the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="2000">year
2000</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Imamura</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   ``Five other companies, including <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and European ones, have
approached us'' since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSC</ENAMEX> proposed developing the H2A to slash
launch costs by half that of the H2, he said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rocket Systems Corp.</ENAMEX> is an unlisted company founded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX> by a
consortium of 73 Japanese companies. Its shareholders include
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy
Industries Co.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan Motor Co.</ENAMEX>,

insurers and 12 commercial banks.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes Electronics Corp.</ENAMEX> is wholly-owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> automaker

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">SEATTLE</ENAMEX>  &MD;  This could be the jet you won't want to mess with  &MD;  a
747 with a laser in its nose.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing Co.</ENAMEX> bid <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> for what could become a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5 billion</NUMEX>
contract to build seven such jets, which could detect and shoot
down hostile missiles in mid-flight.
<p>
   ``This a revolutionary weapons system,'' said Airborne Laser
Program Manager <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Shennum</ENAMEX>. ``This could revolutionize
warfighting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 21st century</TIMEX>.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> has teamed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed Martin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRW</ENAMEX> to bid on the
project following more than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX> of research and
development. A team including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell International</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes
Aircraft</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E Systems</ENAMEX> also is expected to bid by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>'s
deadline.
<p>
   Both teams will submit revised proposals in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>, with final
award <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early next January</TIMEX>. A demonstration aircraft should be flying
by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>, with the first production models going into service by
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2006</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The project is an outgrowth of the Gulf War, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raytheon</ENAMEX>'s
Patriot anti-missile system was pressed into service to shoot down
SCUD surface-to-surface missiles fired by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iraq</ENAMEX>. Despite early
reports of the Patriot's success, later evidence indicated that the
Patriot was too easily fooled by the missiles' breaking up on
re-entry into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX>'s atmosphere.
<p>
   The Airborne Laser would use its own sensors and those aboard
satellites and reconnaissance craft to spot such missiles on their
way up, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shennum</ENAMEX> said. A powerful laser beam would hit the target at
around 40,000 feet from a distance of about 250 miles, while the
missile is still climbing and before it separates into distinct
warheads. Any fallout would land on the area that launched the
missile.
<p>
   ``With our sensors we are able to determine where the missile is
launched from and where it was going to land,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shennum</ENAMEX> said.
Launch-site location would be passed on to ground and air attack
forces, which would then have a much better chance of finding and
destroying the launching equipment.
<p>
   The teeth of the system is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRW</ENAMEX>'s chemically powered laser; an
electric laser would require more hardware than even a 747 could
carry, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shennum</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy Harrison</ENAMEX> said that because the laser uses
what are essentially household chemicals  &MD;  hydrogen peroxide,
chlorine and iodine  &MD;  the expected operating price will be around
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,000</NUMEX> a shot. ``It will be able to fire repeatedly,'' he said. A
missile, by comparison, costs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1-2 million</NUMEX> a copy.
<p>
   Of course, mixing those things together in a bowl at home won't
give you a laser. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed Martin</ENAMEX> had to develop an optical system
that would not only sight the target, but also focus the laser in
such a way that it could survive the vagaries of weather. A laser
is just an incredibly intense beam of light, and like a flashlight
at a distance, that light can dissipate and lose focus.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shennum</ENAMEX> said the problem seems to be solved.
<p>
   ``A lot of progress has been made in that area,'' he said.
Upper-atmosphere turbulence isn't as severe as first thought, and
they've gotten better at focusing.
<p>
   ``All our simulations, all the test experiments prove <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> that
we can deliver the lethal energy required to the distances
required,'' he said. ``Now we have to finalize our design concept
and build it and go up and prove it. We know of no show stoppers.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>'s task in the project is to develop the battle management
system and to integrate the whole thing into a 747-400, perhaps the
only aircraft large enough to carry everything required. The
competing bid, for example, also uses a 747 platform.
<p>
   The airborne platform's mobility also is a selling point.
``We're capable of self-deploying anywhere in the world within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">13
hours</TIMEX>,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shennum</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   ``It's a peaceful deterrent,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shennum</ENAMEX> said. ``It doesn't have
to be over hostile territory to be effective.''

<p>
   On its first close encounter with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jupiter</ENAMEX>'s huge satellite
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ganymede</ENAMEX>, the Galileo spacecraft has found evidence that this
largest moon in the solar system behaves in many surprising ways
like a full-fledged planet.
<p>
   With its 3,269-mile diameter, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ganymede</ENAMEX> is larger than the planet
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mercury</ENAMEX> and about three-quarters the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX>. It is lifeless
and frozen, covered with ice and some dark, rocky debris, but the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ganymede</ENAMEX> revealed by Galileo's first pictures has a surface that is
deeply wrinkled with ridges, fissures and furrows, as well as other
signs that it experiences some of the same dynamic forces that move
continents and cause quakes on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Other instruments on the spacecraft detected an even bigger
surprise. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ganymede</ENAMEX> appears to generate its own magnetic field, a
planet-like characteristic that sets it apart from other moons.
<p>
   What this implies about <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ganymede</ENAMEX>'s interior structure is a
matter of puzzlement and debate for scientists, but it could mean
that despite its cold exterior, the large moon has a molten
metallic core generating the magnetic field, much as happens on
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   But without doubt the first close-up photographs of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ganymede</ENAMEX>,
made public <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>, underscored the success of the
Galileo mission, which in itself is a surprise. Launched in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>,
the spacecraft has suffered one malfunction after another,
including the failure of its main antenna to deploy, which has
limited the number of pictures that can be transmitted.
<p>
   Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William J. O'Neil</ENAMEX>, the project manager at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jet Propulsion
Laboratory</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pasadena</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, recalled <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> the heroic
efforts of engineers to keep the spacecraft going.
<p>
   ``You might say we had to perform a complete brain transplant,''
he said, referring to the reprogramming of Galileo's onboard
software to work around the malfunctions and meet about <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70 percent</NUMEX>
of the original mission objectives.
<p>
   Galileo made it to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jupiter</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last December</TIMEX>, swinging into an orbit
of the planet and sending in an instrumented probe of the dense
Jovian atmosphere. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 27</TIMEX>, it had its first of four planned
encounters with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ganymede</ENAMEX>. Over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next two years</TIMEX>, the spacecraft
is expected to fly close to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jupiter</ENAMEX>'s three other major moons  &MD; 
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Callisto</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Io</ENAMEX>.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">HOUSTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> astronaut <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shannon Lucid</ENAMEX>, a guest aboard <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russia</ENAMEX>'s
Mir space station <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="late March">since late March</TIMEX>, could spend an extra <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six weeks</TIMEX>
orbiting the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> because of the shuttle's rocket booster
problems, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53-year</TIMEX>-old biochemist will shatter the American
longevity record for spaceflight, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">115 days</TIMEX>, established <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year ago</TIMEX>
by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norm Thagard</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucid</ENAMEX>'s stay could be extended to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX> under one scenario
described by officials of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Aeronautics and Space
Administration</ENAMEX>. The agency is investigating the cause of charring
on insulation that protected O-ring joints on boosters used to
launch Columbia on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 20</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The discovery of the damage could delay <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s plans to launch
Atlantis on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 31</TIMEX> to replace <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucid</ENAMEX> with astronaut <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Blaha</ENAMEX>. If
the solid rocket boosters on Atlantis must be replaced, the
shuttle's launching would be postponed until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 15</TIMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tommy
Holloway</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s shuttle program manager.
<p>
   ``She (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucid</ENAMEX>) has no problem with it,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Culbertson</ENAMEX>,
who manages <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s cooperative activities with the Russians aboard
Mir. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Culbertson</ENAMEX>, an astronaut, said he briefed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucid</ENAMEX> personally on
the issues <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``She wants to make sure people down here understand she's very
happy and comfortable. She understands the situation,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Culbertson</ENAMEX>
said. ``She also wants to make sure that people know she should not
be a factor in making the technical decision on whether to fly the
mission with the current booster configuration or to change it.''
<p>
   Experts have discovered some charring from rocket exhaust into
insulation protecting all six of the O-ring joints in both 15-story
solid rocket boosters used in Columbia's launch. The worst of the
damage was found in joints in the middle of the boosters.
<p>
   It was the leak of hot gases through a similar O-ring joint that
triggered the fatal Challenger accident of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>. However, none of
Columbia's O-rings were burned, officials said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holloway</ENAMEX> said engineers continue to believe that a new adhesive
used to bond the insulation on Columbia or a new solvent used to
prepare the material for bonding is the most likely cause of
damage. However, he emphasized that managers will spend at least
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="week">another week</TIMEX> assessing launch forces and other possible factors.
<p>
   If the cause turns out to be the adhesive or solvent, Atlantis'
boosters would be removed and replaced with two new rockets
constructed of the glue and cleaning solution that have been used
in past launches.
<p>
   The space agency and its contractor switched supplies to comply
with environmental regulations. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holloway</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Utah</ENAMEX>-based
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thiokol Corp.</ENAMEX>, the booster contractor, has enough of the old
materials to last 14 missions.
<p>
   Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> towed Atlantis from its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kennedy Space Center</ENAMEX>
launching pad to its assembly hangar on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> when it appeared
the complex might be hit by Hurricane Bertha.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">HOUSTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> announced it will delay by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six weeks</TIMEX> a
mission to retrieve astronaut <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shannon Lucid</ENAMEX>, who is doing research
on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Russia</ENAMEX>'s Mir space station.
<p>
   The decision was prompted by the discovery that the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 20</TIMEX>
launching of the shuttle Columbia produced unexpected exhaust that
charred insulation which protects six O-ring joints.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ENAMEX> therefore
wants to replace the solid rocket boosters on the shuttle Atlantis,
which has been assigned to return <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucid</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The repairs will push the planned launching of Atlantis <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 31</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 15</TIMEX></TIMEX>, though it may be possible for the shuttle's
six-member crew to lift off a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">couple of days earlier</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Atlantis also will ferry several tons of supplies to the
Russians. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucid</ENAMEX> will be replaced by Atlantis astronaut <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Blaha</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucid</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> record-setting space voyage will be extended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="four and a half to six months">from
four and a half to six months</TIMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, she is slated to break
the record of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">115 days</TIMEX>, which was established by former astronaut
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norm Thagard</ENAMEX> about a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year ago</TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``Everyone is in concurrence that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shannon</ENAMEX> is in good shape, and
she's prepared to go longer,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Culbertson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s
manager of joint <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>-Russian space flights. ``These things tend to
happen and you learn to deal with them.''
<p>
   The space agency planned to inform <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucid</ENAMEX> of its decision <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early
Saturday</TIMEX>. However, it has kept her apprised of the booster rocket
issue for more than a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Earlier this week</TIMEX>, she told American reporters she was taking
the delay in stride, though she was disappointed in not being able
to rejoin her family as soon as planned.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 23</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- Defense spending is on the
decline, when adjusted for inflation, and no matter who wins the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX> presidential election, that trend will continue. For all
the campaign rhetoric, the budgets backed by President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX>
and Republican challenger <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Dole</ENAMEX> differ on defense by less than
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1 billion</NUMEX>.
<p>
   There are significant differences, however, on how the
candidates would spend defense money, and that could make all the
difference in the world to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> weapons producers like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed
Martin Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northrop Grumman Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TRW Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonnell
Douglas Corp.</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> is likely to cut personnel, relying more on reserves and
backing fewer humanitarian missions, thereby freeing funds for more
high-technology weapons such as bombers and fighter planes.
<p>
   ``Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> has emphasized one particular weapon system --that's
the ballistic missile defense,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Korb</ENAMEX>, a former
assistant secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">defense</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> administration. ``He
has also talked about adding more B-2 bombers . . . I also think
you will see him buying more F-22s.''
<p>
   If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Korb</ENAMEX>'s scenario plays out, it would boost several defense
contractors, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed Martin Corp.</ENAMEX>, which makes the F-22,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northrop Grumman Corp.</ENAMEX>, which makes the B-2.
<p>
   The radar-evading, wing-shaped B-2 bomber has become a kind of
defense policy litmus test for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> supports the B-2 and has said he wants money added to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> budget for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year starting Oct. 1</TIMEX> to fund
additional B-2s.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> opposes congressional efforts to push the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> in
that direction. He and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Perry</ENAMEX> say the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>'s long-term plans call for spending money on weapons that
are more important than the B-2.
<p>
   The two presidential candidates also have jockeyed over how fast
to develop the ballistic missile defense system. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> moved to set
himself apart from the president by backing a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">multibillion dollar</NUMEX>
revival of President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX>'s ``star wars'' defense
initiative. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> Republicans postponed floor consideration of the
plan, though, after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congressional Budget Office</ENAMEX> estimated it
would cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between $31 billion and $60 billion</NUMEX>. Republicans called
the estimate ``outlandish.''
<p>
   The delay in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> did not deter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> from pushing the plan.
He told workers in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX> that if he were elected he
would make sure there would be major funding for the advanced
missile systems that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed Martin</ENAMEX> has been building <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="1968">since 1968</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Korb</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX> will likely push the plan if he is elected. ``The
ballistic missile defense for Republicans is sort of the foreign
policy equivalent of abortion,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Korb</ENAMEX> told the Bloomberg Forum.
``It's an article of faith (for Republicans) that we have to defend
this country against a ballistic missile attack.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> has his own missile defense plan, but it is smaller and
wouldn't be built as soon. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s plan would cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$14 billion</NUMEX>
over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next five years</TIMEX>. The administration has said it isn't sure
when the system would be deployed. The Republicans want a deadline
and have suggested the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="2003">year 2003</TIMEX>.
<p>
   While <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dole</ENAMEX>'s election would likely help the defense industry, no
one suggests he'll reverse the overall downward trend. ``Defense
spending is probably going to continue to decline, and companies
are going to have to change in response to that,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred
Johnson</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Mexico</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa Fe Technologies Inc.</ENAMEX>,
which develops missile defenses.
<p>
   For industry giants such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed Martin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonnell Douglas</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northrop Grumman</ENAMEX>, the strategy for dealing with defense-budget
cuts has been to purchase other companies' business and slash
operating costs. The smaller component-suppliers companies have
been able to diversify their production to supply other industries,
as well as the defense business.
<p>
   There are a few exceptions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors Corp,</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" MIN="Hughes Electronics">Hughes
Electronics division</ENAMEX> makes missiles, radar systems, and one of the
best-selling consumer products -- the home DirecTV
satellite-broadcast system. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell International Corp.</ENAMEX>
manufactures bombs, and rocket engines, and is a leading maker of
computer modems. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raytheon Co.</ENAMEX> makes defense electronics and missile
systems, provides construction services, and manufacturers Amana
refrigerators and ovens.
<p>
   ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raytheon</ENAMEX> is a good example of a company that isn't depending
just on government contracts, and more companies are going to have
to follow their lead,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Simple mathematics explains why: The portion of the defense
budget earmarked for purchases of new weapons has been slashed by
more than half to about <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$40 billion</NUMEX>. Adjusted for inflation, the
weapons budget in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$124 billion</NUMEX>.
<p>
   As orders have dropped, companies have responded by
consolidating their operations, buying up their competitors'
product lines and pursuing technologies that have both military and
civilian use as a cushion against shrinking federal contracts.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 23</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arianespace</ENAMEX>, a pan-European
satellite launch group, hopes to launch the second <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ariane</ENAMEX> 5 rocket
in ``<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the middle of the first half of 1997</TIMEX>,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean-Marie Luton</ENAMEX>,
the director general of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Space Agency</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luton</ENAMEX>, who was presenting a report on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 4</TIMEX> crash of the
first <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ariane</ENAMEX> 5 launcher, said the proposed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> date was
preliminary.
<p>
   He said the failed launch cost <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 2 percent and 4 percent</NUMEX>
of the total investment so far in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ariane</ENAMEX> 5 development program,
or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between 800 million and 1.6 billion French francs</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$159 million
and $318 million</NUMEX>).
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ariane</ENAMEX> 5 is an unmanned rocket, the most powerful built for
commercial payloads. It had been hoped a further prototype could be
launched as early as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late October</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early November</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The report said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ariane</ENAMEX> 5 failure was caused by ``the
complete loss of guidance and attitude information 37 seconds after
the start of the main engine ignition sequence (30 seconds after
lift-off).''
<p>
   The report blamed the loss of information on ``specification and
design errors in the software of the inertial reference system,''
part of the flight control system that measures the launcher's
movements in space and its position in relation to the horizon, or
attitude.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luton</ENAMEX> stressed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ariane</ENAMEX> 5 program has ``not itself been
undermined by the report, which refers to specific errors.'' He
declined to comment where responsibility for those errors lies,
saying, ``We are all at fault.''
<p>
   The board that wrote the report presented a series of 14
recommendations to improve review procedures for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ariane</ENAMEX> 5
program that it said ``did not include adequate analysis and
testing of the inertial reference system or of the complete flight
control system, which could have detected the potential failure.''
<p>
   The report called for complete simulations before any mission
and recommended that the alignment function should be switched off
after lift-off. More generally, software functions should not run
during a flight unless needed.
<p>
   Among other recommendations, the board urged the inclusion in
the review procedures of participants from outside the project. The
board also called for ``more transparent cooperation among the
partners in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ariane</ENAMEX> 5 program'' which it said should provide
``clear-cut authority and responsibility''.
<p>
   German Technology Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juergen Ruettgers</ENAMEX> welcomed the
report, saying he would seek early agreement with his French
counterpart <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francois Fillon</ENAMEX> on how best to implement it. He agreed
with the recommendations to clarify lines of responsibility and
draw on independent experts, and urged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESA</ENAMEX> to take a more active
role in overseeing the project.
<p>
   ``We must not allow ourselves to be put under time pressure in
this process,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruettgers</ENAMEX> said. Only the result of a second test
flight will show whether a third flight is needed, he added. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESA</ENAMEX>
had earlier indicated that a third flight ``would contribute
towards the qualification'' of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ariane</ENAMEX> 5 program.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruettgers</ENAMEX> said participating governments should on no account
provide extra funds for any such flight. Instead, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESA</ENAMEX> should find
the money out of existing budgets, particularly those for follow-up
projects to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ariane</ENAMEX> 5, he said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luton</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Space Agency</ENAMEX> will study the report's
recommendations and present its own full proposals for future
action to the board in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Among elements that are likely to become clearer in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX> is
whether the second <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ariane</ENAMEX> 5 launcher will have a commercial payload
on board. Further information is also expected at that time on the
financial implications for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ariane</ENAMEX> 5 program as a whole. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESA</ENAMEX>
said it would hold a further press conference in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-September</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arianespace</ENAMEX> currently controls more than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> of the global
satellite launch market and booked 14 orders in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first half of
1996</TIMEX>. The order backlog as at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 24</TIMEX> totalled 44 satellites worth
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">18.2 billion francs</NUMEX>. Further launches of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ariane</ENAMEX> 4 rocket are
scheduled, including that of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Telecom</ENAMEX> 2D satellite for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">France
Telecom</ENAMEX> ``within the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next few weeks</TIMEX>,'' according to a spokesman for
the state-owned group.
<p>
   More precise timing was not available. The spokesman would not
comment on whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">France Telecom</ENAMEX> would put satellites on a future
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ariane</ENAMEX> 5 flight. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arianespace</ENAMEX>'s other major clients include
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelsat</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eutelsat</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&AMP;T</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   A spokeswoman for French insurer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assurances Generales de France</ENAMEX>
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGF</ENAMEX>) confirmed the group's insurance program was being maintained
on an unchanged basis for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ariane</ENAMEX> 4 flights. She added that the
delays to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ariane</ENAMEX> 5 program ``inevitably changes the calendar
for the first launch, no doubt pushing it back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of 1997</TIMEX>
at the earliest.''
<p>
   The spokeswoman said it was too early to assess the impact on
insurance premiums. French insurers reportedly made a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3 billion
franc</NUMEX> profit in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ariane</ENAMEX> 4 insured launches because of the
high success rate.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arianespace</ENAMEX> is a group of more than 50 European aerospace and
defense companies that builds rockets to launch telecommunications
and scientific satellites.
<p>
   French companies, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aerospatiale</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L'Air Liquide</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Societe de Propulsion</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEP</ENAMEX>), hold a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55 percent</NUMEX> stake in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arianespace</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   German companies including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daimler Benz Aerospace</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DASA</ENAMEX>, own
a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19 percent</NUMEX> stake. A total of 12 European nations are represented
in the consortium.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">SEATTLE</ENAMEX>  &MD;  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>'s purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell International</ENAMEX>'s defense
and space business may make it the world's biggest space company.
But the company's biggest challenge will be to make money at it.
<p>
   As it integrates the business units newly acquired from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX>, analysts say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> will have to pursue new frontiers and
refine existing programs. And with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Aeronautics and
Space Administration</ENAMEX> turning more and more responsibility over to
private business, space is no longer the final frontier. Making
money in space is.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>'s space-oriented divisions, much like its post-cold war
military programs, face tight markets with few customers, mostly
governments, and uncertain finances.
<p>
   But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> and the analysts who follow the company say the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seattle</ENAMEX>-based firm is well positioned to boldly go where few
businesses have gone before. By spreading its defense and space
business across a wide range of products, analysts say, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> will
find a way to make money.
<p>
   ``If they didn't think they could make money at it they wouldn't
do it,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Whitlow</ENAMEX>, research director at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific Crest
Securities</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seattle</ENAMEX>. ``That's one of the changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>'s
philosophy in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last decade</TIMEX>. They're not going to go after
business if it's not going to make money.''
<p>
   The most solid part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>'s newly expanded space portfolio
could be the satellite business. Thousands of satellites will be
launched in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next two decades</TIMEX>, experts say, because it's the
easiest, quickest way to transmit data. Launching them into orbit
is a significant cost component. The low-cost provider will get
plenty of business.
<p>
   ``The demand is obviously there,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitlow</ENAMEX> said. ``No matter how
you do it, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>'s got their foot in the door. They have better
skills at this (space systems) than anybody else, especially with
the addition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX> component.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>'s satellite program now includes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SeaLaunch</ENAMEX>
partnership, the Space Shuttle, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ukraine</ENAMEX> medium-payload
launch venture, and the EELV reusable rocket project for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air
Force</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> is playing both sides of the street,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitlow</ENAMEX> said.
``Not only are they <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s largest contractor, they're also
involved in the private launch business.''
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX> purchase includes a division that builds
satellites. That gives <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> the opportunity to offer customers
turn-key packages of satellite and launch, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Jacobs</ENAMEX>,
aerospace analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ragen MacKenzie</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seattle</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   But satellites are just the tip of the rocket. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> is prime
contractor for the Space Station. Through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> now is
jointly responsible with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed</ENAMEX> for operating the Space Shuttle,
and engine supplier for the X-33 reusable space launch vehicle.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> hopes to provide composites and operational expertise to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed</ENAMEX> on that venture.
<p>
   ``They've got their fingers in enough of the future
developmental programs that they'll continue to be a player no
matter what happens,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacobs</ENAMEX>. ``They're not going to live or
die by a single program.''
<p>
   That's good, because big programs such as the Space Station and
the X-33 reusable launch vehicle come with big risks.
<p>
   The Space Station, for example, is up against tight budgetary
constraints and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> is facing technological challenges in
developing its part of the package. The Russians reportedly are
behind schedule on their end of the program, including the
energy-generating FGB module scheduled to go into orbit in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November
1997</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> called in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> to act as a sort of
construction manager for the station, letting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> apply the
system-integration skills that have become one the firm's core
competencies. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> space agency has made it clear that it
is rapidly moving to a role in which it will support research and
development, and leave the business of space launch and operation
to the private sector. Eventually, that could include the Space
Station.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> has experience turning big risk into profits, both in
commercial and defense ventures.
<p>
   At the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">beginning of the decade</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>'s defense group was
losing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundreds of millions of dollars</NUMEX> a year. Now, it's solidly
profitable.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> achieved that by cutting costs, slashing payroll and
focusing on contracts that could make money, said spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dave
Suffia</ENAMEX>. Money-losing projects like the Peace Shield ground radar
and the A-6 aircraft re-wing were jettisoned, and employment
dropped from 53,000 to 31,000 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``We've made sure that the programs we have been involved with
are really sound financially,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Suffia</ENAMEX> said. ``And we're just a
heck of a lot more efficient at what we're doing.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>'s tally of big-ticket defense projects includes the V-22
Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft; military derivatives of the 767; RAH-66
Commanche attack helicopter; and the F-22 advanced tactical
fighter. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> also is bidding on potentially lucrative contracts
for an airborne laser system and the Joint Strike Fighter, and it's
working on unmanned aircraft and high-tech in-flight antenna
systems, both of which could provide big payoffs in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next
century</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX> acquisitions bring in a number of mature programs
such as the B-1B bomber and the Space Shuttle, plus potentially
profitable ventures such as electro-optical and laser technology.
<p>
   The key to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>'s success in space and defense will be making
full use of its talents, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacobs</ENAMEX> said, including those added from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``What <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> has to do to make this acquisition pay off in the
long term is create new business opportunities from this,'' he
said. ``You need one plus one to equal three.''

   Testing into high energy chemical propellants was halted there
immediately after two scientists were killed in an illegal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>
rocket-fuel explosion. The field lab continues to test-fire Atlas
and Delta rockets, and experiment with liquid metal cooling
systems.
<p>
   Concerns about health problems at the company's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Santa Susana
Field Laboratory</ENAMEX> intensified in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1989</TIMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Daily
News</ENAMEX> reported that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy Department</ENAMEX> had discovered radioactive
and chemical contamination at the mountain test range three miles
west of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chatsworth</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   After that revelation, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Katz</ENAMEX>, D-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panorama City</ENAMEX>, then-Assemblywoman
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cathie Wright</ENAMEX>, R-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Simi Valley</ENAMEX>, and then-Assemblyman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terry Friedman</ENAMEX>,
D-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Encino</ENAMEX>, pressured the health agency to conduct the study.
<p>
   Geared up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years ago</TIMEX>, the study's primary aim is to examine
the health histories of more than 6,000 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rocketdyne</ENAMEX> nuclear workers
involved in research efforts at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Santa Susana</ENAMEX> and the company's
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canoga Park</ENAMEX> plant.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harrison</ENAMEX> said public panel members had known <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="last year">since last year</TIMEX>
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rocketdyne</ENAMEX> would be on the distribution list and permitted to
add its input to the final report.
<p>
   Public panel member <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Hirsch</ENAMEX> denied that and said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harrison</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX> tried to win permission from the advisory board to let
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rocketdyne</ENAMEX> officials see the preliminary results, but panel members
voted ``no'' 5-1 during a conference call.
<p>
   ``Now that they have broken the agreement and made a sham of the
oversight panel, we don't know whether to resign or take it to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Legislature</ENAMEX>,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hirsch</ENAMEX>, an anti-nuclear activist.
<p>
   ``It's unprecedented: The fundamental principle in scientific
peer reviews is that no (party) with an economic interest in the
outcome is allowed,'' he said.
<p>
   In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 1995</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCLA</ENAMEX> scientists reported they had made
significant strides in their research, identifying 5,100 workers
exposed to various levels of radiation. They also compiled death
records on roughly 3,500 workers, concluding that 10 died of cancer
caused by asbestos exposure and 37 others of brain tumors.
<p>
   No direct connection, however, was made between their deaths and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rocketdyne</ENAMEX> operations.
<p>
   Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hal Morgenstern</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCLA</ENAMEX> epidemiological expert leading the
research effort, said he couldn't understand what the brouhaha was
about.
<p>
   ``I'm not worried about it,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morgenstern</ENAMEX> said. ``I'm
responsible for what goes into that report, and I'm not about to
change what's in it just because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX> disagrees. If they give
valid feedback, we can respond to that.''

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">LOS ANGELES</ENAMEX>  &MD;  News that a Martian meteorite found in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Antarctica</ENAMEX>
might have contained life came as scientists at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jet
Propulsion Laboratory</ENAMEX> busily prepare to launch the first of 10
unmanned missions to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Red Planet</ENAMEX>, beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``It certainly is an exciting day!'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norm Haynes</ENAMEX>, director
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX> Exploration Program at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JPL</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pasadena</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>
<p>
   This cosmic coincidence in timing has led scientists at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JPL</ENAMEX> to
wonder whether they should accelerate their plans and retrieve a
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX> rock in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="2003">year 2003</TIMEX>  &MD;  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="two years sooner">two years sooner than intended</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX> Global Surveyor will blast off in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>, followed in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX> Pathfinder and then another launch <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every 25 months
until the year 2005</TIMEX>, all to better understand the most <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>-like
of all planets in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Solar System</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Exactly when a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX> rock is returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> will hinge on
whether scientists worldwide agree with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Aeronautics and
Space Administration</ENAMEX> that the meteorite contains bacteria fossils  &MD; 
evidence that life existed on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>'s next-door neighbor.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JPL</ENAMEX> scientists had expected to retrieve a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX> sample during a
mission to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Red Planet</ENAMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="2005">year 2005</TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``If analysis of the meteorite indicates that life is verified,
or at least if there is a consensus in the scientific community,
there will probably be some push to move up the sample return,''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haynes</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   Further, the evidence of life will give scientists a better idea
of where to look for a sample, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haynes</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   ``What we have to do is find the right place for the right
sample,'' he said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> administrator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel S. Goldin</ENAMEX> said the meteorite discovery
might herald other changes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX> missions.
<p>
   ``In a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">few years</TIMEX>, we may want to consider some very bold
missions,'' he said, adding that some missions might dig into the
Martian surface in search of samples.
<p>
   ``We will have to ask, will robots do the task, or do we need
astronauts. But these are questions we will have to ask on a
systematic basis,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Golden</ENAMEX> added.
<p>
   Whatever changes are made are too late for Global Surveyor and
Pathfinder.
<p>
   As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> announced its findings <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JPL</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX> team made
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last-minute</TIMEX> adjustments to Pathfinder and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX> Global Surveyor,
before taking them <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</TIMEX> to the launch site in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cape Canaveral</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX> Pathfinder will be the first lander to visit <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX> since the
Viking missions some <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years ago</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Global Surveyor will explore <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX> from space in the same way
that scientists had hoped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JPL</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX> Observer would have, before it
was lost in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> after firing its rockets.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX> Pathfinder's scheduled landing on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Independence Day 1997</TIMEX> is
expected to provide much information about the planet's composition
and climate, but probably not any more clues about the possibility
of life there.
<p>
   A key focus for scientists will be how <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX> once supported
water, the root of life.
<p>
   ``It would be a long shot if we saw direct fossil evidence,''
said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rob Manning</ENAMEX>, the flight system chief engineer. ``However, our
work could be complementary on the water question.''
<p>
   Also, Pathfinder's four-wheeled, 20-pound rover may help
researchers search the surface of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX> for rocks that are made of
the same material as the meteorite found in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Antarctica</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``What we can do is see if there is the same general elemental
composition and mineralogy of those meteorites,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donna
Shirley</ENAMEX>, program manager of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX> Explorer programs.
<p>
   ``And we will be getting close up pictures with the rover
camera. That may or may not tell us how they compare with the
meteorite,'' she said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> scientists said that chemical and microscopic tests of
minute pieces of the meteorite show there must have been life on
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX> some <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3.6 billion years ago</TIMEX>. The rock was found in an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Antarctic</ENAMEX>
ice field <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="12 years ago">12 years ago, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="13,000 years">13,000 years after it is believed to have
landed there</TIMEX></TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``We know we have picked just the right spot to go with
Pathfinder, because Pathfinder is going to a place where we expect
there to be rocks from the ancient highlands,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shirley</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   The Pathfinder spacecraft and the subsequent missions will not
be able to conduct the same sophisticated study of rocks that the
meteorite underwent on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> scientists used an extremely
large piece of equipment to peer inside particles a billionth the
size of a pinhead.
<p>
   ``Right now we don't have the technology. Certainly our
spacecraft was not designed to do that. We are on a geologic
mission,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manning</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   One thing that the meteorite discovery affirms for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JPL</ENAMEX>
scientists is the need to make sure their spacecraft do not
contaminate <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>-spawned germs, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manning</ENAMEX> said. ``It just
emphasizes the need to keep the spacecraft clean  &MD;  biologically
clean.''

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Aug. 20</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westinghouse Electric Corp.</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> said it plans to launch a new cable television channel focusing
on people and using programming from its news, entertainment and
sports divisions.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> also formed an alliance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discover Communications Inc.</ENAMEX> --
parent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discovery Channel</ENAMEX> -- to create programming for the
Eye on the People channel, a name that will capitalize on the
network's eye-shaped symbol.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westinghouse</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael ``Jordan</ENAMEX> realizes he's behind in
the cable race and they have to get something going as soon as
possible,'' said analyst <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Art Rockwell</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yaeger Capital Markets</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The channel, to be launched <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 31</TIMEX>, is the latest push by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weztinghouse</ENAMEX> to expand into cable television. The company owns a
stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaylord Entertainment Co.</ENAMEX>, parent of the Country Music
cable channel, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX> bought <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TeleNoticias</ENAMEX>, a
Spanish-language channel for Latin American cable and satellite
viewers.
<p>
   The new cable channel gives <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> leverage with local cable
operators. Without the cable channel, operators had the right under
federal regulations to carry the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> network without compensating
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> declined to say whether any cable companies have agreed to
carry the channel, which will consist of ``original reality-based
programming will focus on people, contemporary and historical, in
and out of the headlines,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   Having a cable channel ``gives them more bargaining power with
the cable operators,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rockwell</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>, the only network not to have its own cable channel,
announced the channel <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="six weeks">six weeks before an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 1</TIMEX> deadline</TIMEX> set by
federal regulations that governs whether cable operators can be
compensated for carrying just the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> network.
<p>
   The three other major networks already have cable channels. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">News
Corp.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox</ENAMEX> has <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fX</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Walt Disney Co.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> has <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESPN2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General
Electric Co.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> has <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSNBC</ENAMEX>, formerly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">America's Talking</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> said
it will use programming and production resources from its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS News</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS Sports</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS Entertainment</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eyemark Entertainment</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group W</ENAMEX> archives.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westinghouse</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group W Network Services</ENAMEX> will handle production
and satellite distribution of the channel.
<p>
   ``This is an important strategic step for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westinghouse/CBS</ENAMEX> that
establishes a new position in the multichannel universe,'' said
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Jordan</ENAMEX>, chairman and chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westinghouse</ENAMEX>.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">LOS ANGELES</ENAMEX>  &MD;  A satellite launched <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> will monitor the
undulating curtains of the aurora light in the polar <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> sky in
an effort to explain its mysteries.
<p>
   The satellite, the Fast Auroral Snapshot, or FAST, is the second
of a new generation of smaller and cheaper spacecraft that
scientists say are the future of orbiter-based research. The
400-pound craft was launched on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> aboard a rocket from an
L-1011 jumbo jet, which was flying off the coast 150 miles
northwest of here.
<p>
   FAST will orbit as low as 220 miles above <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>, gathering
information and photographs of auroras on a scale of a few meters
rather than one kilometer, the scale of previous studies.
<p>
   In the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northern Hemisphere</ENAMEX>, the multicolored veil is called the
aurora borealis, or northern lights. Auroras are most visible near
the magnetic <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North and South Poles</ENAMEX> and can stretch across the
horizon for hundreds of miles at an altitude of 70 miles.
<p>
   ``Anyone who has seen the aurora borealis is impressed by the
colors,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Carlson</ENAMEX>, the principal investigator for FAST
and a professor at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of California at Berkeley</ENAMEX>. ``But
we as scientists are interested in the physical properties that
cause these aurora displays.''
<p>
   A project scientist from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goddard Space Flight Center</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greenbelt</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Md.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Pfaff</ENAMEX>, said the research would help explain
similar phenomena on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jupiter</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Scientists also hope to gain insight into solar flares, which
add to the auroras' intensity. Those occasional explosions from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sun</ENAMEX> disrupt the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>'s magnetic field and can make an aurora
visible as far south as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Auroras are mainly powered by electrons, which are stripped by
solar winds from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sun</ENAMEX> and sent hurtling through space. FAST will
monitor the electrons in thousandths of a second as they are drawn
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>'s magnetic poles and are accelerated by electrical
fields into the atmosphere, where they cast their hazy glow.
<p>
   Scientists expect FAST to be in use for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="two years">at least two years</TIMEX>,
before its orbit decays or radiation damages it. The instruments
are to be fully operational in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">few months</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$72.2 million</NUMEX> project is part of a five-craft Small-Class
Explorer series of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Aeronautics and Space
Administration</ENAMEX>. The government intends the effort to make launching
a space satellite faster and cheaper than large-scale <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">multiyear</TIMEX>
endeavors like the Hubble Space Telescope. The other satellite in
the series was launched in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>, to monitor solar winds.
<p>
   ``The scientific community is really thrilled by this program,''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pfaff</ENAMEX> said. ``Projects in the past were really getting drawn out,
because large aircraft take longer to build.''

MARTIAN ODYSSEY AT STARTING GATE

<p>
   The pair of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> spacecraft that will be launched to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this
year</TIMEX> have arrived at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kennedy Space Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> to be
readied for flights that have taken on new import since the report
that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX> may once have supported primitive life.
<p>
   Neither spacecraft is designed to directly detect evidence of
life, past or present, but both are expected to expand
understanding of the planet.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX> Global Surveyor, a 1-ton spacecraft, will be launched
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>. After reaching <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1997</TIMEX>, it will circle
the planet for an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="Martian year">entire Martian year  &MD;  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">687 Earth days</TIMEX>  &MD;</TIMEX>  mapping
the surface of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">red planet</ENAMEX> in detail.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX> Pathfinder, scheduled for launch in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX>, will
follow a faster track to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX>. The spacecraft is expected to land
on the surface on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 4, 1997</TIMEX>, releasing a small robot rover,
Sojourner, that will roam the surface of the planet.
<p>
     NEXT: LIVING TO 130  
<p>
   Get the birthday candles ready. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duke University</ENAMEX> researchers say
changing human life spans make it likely that at least one person
currently alive in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> will live to the ripe, and
unprecedented, old age of 130 or 135.
<p>
   Although a number of people claim to be older, the oldest living
person whose age can be reliably documented <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> is a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">121-year</TIMEX>-old
woman in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duke</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center for Demographic Studies</ENAMEX> says
conservative projections of population suggest that someone alive
will easily top that. With improving control of chronic diseases,
nutrition and overall health, they say, there is no ``biological
brick wall'' that sets an absolute limit on human life.
<p>
   The oldest old, in fact, are likely to have lots of company.
Within the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next 50 years</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> is expected to have
more than 1 million people over the age of 100  &MD;  and about 4
million or 5 million over the age of 95.
<p>
   A BRAIN FOR ROMANCE
<p>
   Birdbrain may not be the pejorative it's cracked up to be.
Researchers have discovered that songbirds' brains vary in size
according to the season.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Washington</ENAMEX> zoology graduate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Troy Smith</ENAMEX> says
seasonal changes in the size of certain parts of sparrows' brains
track the rise and fall of the hormone testosterone, which
increases 100-fold at the peak of the breeding season in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX>.
<p>
   It's not a case of birds needing a bigger brain specifically to
breed, though. It's all for the song. Rising levels of testosterone
triple the size of two portions of avian brains involved in
singing. And that may explain why some birds need <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> tuneups
before going courting.
<p>
   ``Essentially the bird is making little mistakes, much like a
musician who is playing a song for the first time in a while and is
a little rusty,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX>, who did the research for his Ph.D.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greenwich</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Connecticut</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Aug. 27</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PanAmSat Corp.</ENAMEX>
shares rose as much as <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.2 percent</NUMEX> on speculation the satellite
company may soon reach an agreement to be acquired for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4 billion
to $5 billion</NUMEX>, analysts say.
<p>
   Shares rose 1 3/8 to 27 1/4 in late trading of 333,400, more
than double the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three-month</TIMEX> daily average of 158,100. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Earlier</TIMEX>, the
stock touched 28.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greenwich</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Connecticut</ENAMEX>-based company is attractive because
it has reserved several good orbital positions for new satellites.
The company already operates four satellites that broadcast video
and audio service in much of the world except the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
<p>
   ``For anyone who buys it, it gives them an immediate worldwide
presence in the satellite industry,'' said analyst <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Watts</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co.</ENAMEX>
<p>
   The likely buyers include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors Corp.</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes
Communications Inc.</ENAMEX> unit, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Electric Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loral Space &AMP;
Communications Ltd.</ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Watts</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PanAmSat</ENAMEX>, which has about <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1 billion</NUMEX> in debt and 100 million
shares outstanding, would be valued at least <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3.6 billion</NUMEX> and may
fetch <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4 billion to $5 billion</NUMEX> in an acquisition, analysts said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PanAmSat</ENAMEX> declined to comment. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes</ENAMEX> spokeswoman said the
company ``neither confirms nor denies'' acquisition speculation.
<p>
   In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PanAmSat</ENAMEX> said it was considering selling itself or
merging with another company to satisfy the needs of its largest
shareholders, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mexico</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grupo Televisa SA</ENAMEX> and the family of its
founder, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rene Anselmo</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PanAmSat</ENAMEX> hired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley &AMP; Co.</ENAMEX> to
explore the company's options.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes</ENAMEX> said in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> it was interested in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PanAmSat</ENAMEX>'s network.
Three of the four <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PanAmSat</ENAMEX> satellites were build by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PanAmSat</ENAMEX> contracted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes</ENAMEX> to build satellites that it plans to
launch in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next few years</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The company would be a good fit with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Loral</ENAMEX> because
it's the ``only company, other than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelsat</ENAMEX>, that has a global
fleet currently operating,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Watts</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelsat</ENAMEX> is an international telecommunications and broadcast
satellite operator owned by about 139 member countries. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes</ENAMEX>
operates nine domestic satellites, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GE</ENAMEX> operates 12 domestic
satellites, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Watts</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PanAmSat</ENAMEX>'s four satellites service customers in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Asia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">India</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>, and other areas. The company had
earnings of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$17.5 million</NUMEX> on revenue of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$116 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Texans in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> that President
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> will have to demonstrate a clear <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> interest in the Iraqi
dispute to keep their support.
<p>
   ``At this point, I think what he's done is correct, and I'm very
hopeful he doesn't try to expand this mission,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kay
Bailey Hutchison</ENAMEX>, R-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, a member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Armed Services
Committee</ENAMEX>. ``This is not like Desert Storm, and we do not have a
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> security interest there.''
<p>
   At least one Texan, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamar Smith</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Antonio</ENAMEX>
Republican, was not prepared <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> to support the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> missile
strike.
<p>
   ``We would not be in this position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> if over the course of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last six months</TIMEX> we had sent ge to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> that we
opposed his military buildup,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> said. ``Suddenly we lurch to
life and launch missiles.
<p>
   ``I have three questions I think need to be answered before the
administration will enjoy my support,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> said. ``How did we
ever get to the point where we're launching the missiles? And what
happens next? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> is not known as a rational human being
. . . And why are our allies not supporting us? We've only got one,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Britain</ENAMEX>, that supported our action at the time the missiles
were launched.
<p>
   ``This isn't a time to cheer the administration on,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX>
said. ``It's a time to ask questions.''
<p>
   Opposite <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> was a veteran of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian Gulf</ENAMEX> war  &MD;  <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> Rep.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greg Laughlin</ENAMEX>, a Republican from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Columbia</ENAMEX>, a member of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Army Reserve</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> is not to be trusted,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laughlin</ENAMEX> said. ``The
only thing he understands is force. Certainly, the president did
the right thing in responding.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> did not consult with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> before ordering the
missile strike on Iraqi air defenses, but <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd Doggett</ENAMEX>,
an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Austin</ENAMEX> Democrat, said he would expect <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> to seek <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>'
OK before taking any further action.
<p>
   ``While this is what I view as a very measured response and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> is the kind of person who only understands force, any
lengthy involvement in a Kurdish civil war definitely requires
consultation with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doggett</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil Gramm</ENAMEX>, R-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, said in a statement on the floor
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> that he and others ``owe it to the president to give
him the benefit of the doubt on military matters.''
<p>
   ``Having said that,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gramm</ENAMEX> continued, ``if we look at the
fundamental conflict, it is a conflict between two warring Kurdish
factions, one backed by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iraq</ENAMEX> and one backed by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran</ENAMEX>, and we do not
have a dog in that fight . . . I think the president would be
poorly advised in becoming involved in that conflict, and I would
not and could not support such an involvement.''

MAKING THE PITCH: SAMPLING PROGRAMS EXPLODING, BENEFITS MIXED
(For use by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times News Service</ENAMEX> clients)
By <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernice Kanner</ENAMEX>
c.<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomberg Business News</ENAMEX>
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 9</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This summer</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quaker Oats</ENAMEX>
handed out millions of free Snapple drinks in an effort to
rejuvenate the fruit-based soft drink brand and perhaps justify its
massive purchase price. Anyone living in a state beginning with a
consonant or a vowel qualified.
<p>
   That's just one of many current programs in a sampling industry
that's exploding. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past three years</TIMEX>, sampling has grown <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 to
20 percent</NUMEX> a year -- faster than any other element of promotion
spending by companies, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lafayette Jones</ENAMEX>, chairman of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Product Sampling Council</ENAMEX> unit of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" MIN="Promotion Marketing Association">Promotion Marketing
Association of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX></ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> estimated that sampling accounts for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$600 million</NUMEX> in
marketing expenses, plus the cost of the products being given away.
And that doesn't include practices like the test drive to sell
cars, which has been on the increase.
<p>
   But there are no assurances that sampling will work and experts
say the best programs are for products with unique features.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> said depending on what's being sampled, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 percent</NUMEX> of
people who sample something actually buy it. Other industry
analysts said a successful sampling program typically converts <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10
percent to 15 percent</NUMEX> of consumers into regular customers.
<p>
   It partly depends on what's being sampled. Nine of every ten
sun-soakers may take a free soda pop at the beach on a hot day
while six to seven of ten women might try a fabric softener mailed
to their homes.
<p>
   One study found it cost more than four times to motivate a
``trier'' using discount coupons -- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2.30</NUMEX> compared with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 cents</NUMEX> --
than with sampling. Converting them to loyalists cost on average
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$6.50</NUMEX>, compared with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2.50</NUMEX> via sampling.
<p>
   Sampling should grow. Some <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56 percent</NUMEX> of manufacturers planned
to increase their overall sampling budgets <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>, according to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donnelley Marketing</ENAMEX>'s Survey of Promotional Practices. The average
company allocated <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 percent</NUMEX> of its consumer promotion budget to
sampling. Industry executives estimate that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 percent</NUMEX> more
companies are sampling their products <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> than a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year ago</TIMEX>.
<p>
   More than three of every four marketers (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">78 percent</NUMEX>) consider
sampling an effective way to convince consumers to try established
products, up from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">63 percent</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donnelley Marketing</ENAMEX> found.
About <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75 percent</NUMEX> say it works stimulating trial of new products, up
from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 percent</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donnelley Marketing</ENAMEX> found that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">89 percent</NUMEX> of manufacturers use,
or have used, in-store sampling, where typically retailers grant
extra shelf space to products being demonstrated; that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">53 percent</NUMEX>
attach samples to another product or put a sample inside; and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">47
percent</NUMEX> have sampled at local events. Some <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28 percent</NUMEX> distribute
product samples via direct mail and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22 percent</NUMEX> mail samples when
consumers request them. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Thirteen percent</NUMEX> use newspapers, magazines
and alternate delivery.
<p>
   The fastest growing areas of sampling, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PMA</ENAMEX>, are
complementary packaging and venue-based sampling. ``They minimize
costs and maximize consumer feedback, and aim products at specific
audiences pre-disposed to try its products,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Malls are an ideal place to sample, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Hackett</ENAMEX>, vice
president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Market Source</ENAMEX>, a marketing company in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cranbury</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New
Jersey</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``At malls, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70 percent</NUMEX> of shoppers have neither a specific
purchase nor destination in mind,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hackett</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   Despite the obvious up-front costs, marketers say sampling is
efficient. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbie Gumman</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lakewood</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado</ENAMEX>-based
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Promote It International</ENAMEX>, which distributed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jergens</ENAMEX> Shower-Active
moisturizer, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Helene Curtis</ENAMEX>'s Degree antiperspirant, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quaker</ENAMEX> toasted
oatmeal, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welch</ENAMEX>'s juice and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kellogg's</ENAMEX> low fat Granola Bars at its
network of 4,000 health clubs, said it costs about a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nickel</NUMEX> a
sample. But, she said, on average <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19 percent</NUMEX> of people later buy
the product.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rick Tanner</ENAMEX>, product manager for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Brands</ENAMEX>' Glad Bags,
samples of which were bagged with newspapers around <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St.Louis</ENAMEX>, said
that as a result of that program, ``in a short time, an undeveloped
market became a developed one.'' And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taco Bell</ENAMEX> marketers credit its
8 million lunchtime Border Lights taco and burrito give-away at the
chain's 4,500 stores with overcoming perceptions that low fat means
lousy taste.
<p>
   Skeptics need only refer to the launch of the cat litter
category in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1947</TIMEX>, when sand was selling for a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY" MIN="penny">penny a pound</NUMEX> and no
one knew what <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY" MIN="65-cents">65-cents-a-pound</NUMEX> Kitty Litter was. But after inventor
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Lowe</ENAMEX> pressured retailers to give away the clay based odor
absorber, customers returned and asked for Kitty Litter by name. It
marked the birth of the brand -- and a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$700 million</NUMEX> category.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">PASADENA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>  &MD;  While scientists at several laboratories
examine a dark piece of rock to see if it indeed holds evidence of
early life on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> officials are weighing a wide assortment
of ideas for revamping and accelerating current plans for exploring
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">red planet</ENAMEX>. The focus is on how and when to secure what
scientists covet most: an indisputable sample of Martian rock and
soil, preferably from a relatively warm, wet place where microbes
might have arisen long ago.
<p>
   Mission planners and scientists are expected to offer
recommendations to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Aeronautics and Space
Administration</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX>. They want to take advantage of public
and political enthusiasms touched off by the announcement <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last
month</TIMEX> that a meteorite that apparently fell from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX> contained
mineral and fossil traces of possible life. They also need to have
mission options ready for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> budget planning, negotiations with
potential international partners and a conference on space at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX>.
<p>
   But developing a proposal for a mission to obtain samples from
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX> is more than dreaming up an elaborate wish list. Nowhere are
the practical cost-conscious aspects of such planning quite so
evident as in a large windowless room of the Project Design Center
here at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   On a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent afternoon</TIMEX>, some two dozen engineers and scientists
sat at long tables, each an expert in a specific spacecraft
component or mission function and each with a computer terminal at
the ready. Placards atop their computers identified many of their
specialties: propulsion, telecommunications, ground control and
tracking systems, mission design and costs. The cost manager acted
as a strict policeman, keeping the others in line.
<p>
   This was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Team X</ENAMEX>, and it was brainstorming a mission, to be
launched in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>, to land a small craft on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX> within a mile or so
of a roving vehicle that is to arrive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years earlier</TIMEX> and collect
and sort rock samples. After it receives a sample from the rover,
the upper part of the landing craft must rocket off the surface and
rendezvous with the main spacecraft waiting in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX> orbit. A sealed
container with the sample would be transferred from the lander to
the main craft for the return to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2006</TIMEX>.
<p>
   An expedition along these lines, though complex and risky, is
considered one of the most promising ways to retrieve a sample for
the study of life on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX> in a reasonable time and within a modest
budget. A direct flight to the Martian surface and back to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>
might be simpler and more straightforward, but could be more
expensive.
<p>
   ``We are seriously looking at a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX> sample return,'' said Dr.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel J. McCleese</ENAMEX>, manager of space sciences at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jet Propulsion
Laboratory</ENAMEX> and leader of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX> science program. ``We don't
think it is wise to go more quickly, and no one in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> is
pressuring us in that direction.''
<p>
   The amount of money available for exploring <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX> is a big
question. Current plans call for spending <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1 billion</NUMEX> over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next
decade</TIMEX> on several missions to orbit and land on the planet to study
its climate and geology and look for sites where life might have
arisen or might still exist. Opting for a sample-return mission in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX> would require an increase in spending.
<p>
   Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donna L. Shirley</ENAMEX>, manager of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX> exploration program at
the laboratory, said mission planners would need a decision <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this
winter</TIMEX> if they were to gear up for a sample-return mission in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>,
which would be at least <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years earlier</TIMEX> than previously
considered. ``We're working like mad to be ready,'' she said, ``but
we're anxiously awaiting direction.''
<p>
   The work of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Team X</ENAMEX> on such a mission is part of these
preparations. Its previous design analysis showed that a more
direct return mission would be simpler, but would require that the
entire spacecraft be flown to the surface of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX> and then off
again. This would mean hauling much more propellant, which in turn
means having to use a large, more expensive rocket to launch the
flight from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>. In all, at launching, the spacecraft weight
would surpass 10,000 pounds, half of which would be nothing but
fuel. Only a Titan 4 or Russian <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proton</ENAMEX> rocket would be capable of
lifting that weight, but at a cost now viewed as prohibitive.
<p>
   The attraction of the rendezvous mission under study is that all
the propellants for the return to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> would remain in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX>
orbiter; extra energy would not have to be expended lifting off
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX>, and a Delta-class rocket could launch the total mission load,
at a third of the cost of more powerful boosters. Similar thinking
in the Apollo Project in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1960s</TIMEX> led to the decision to send
astronauts to the lunar surface in a small module, which then
returned to link up with the command module in lunar orbit for the
return trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   In studies so far, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shirley</ENAMEX> said, neither the direct or
rendezvous mission has emerged as the favored approach for
returning a rock sample.

<p>
   The committee of 30 government and university scientists and
engineers, led by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCleese</ENAMEX>, was asked to recommend to the space
agency by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of this month</TIMEX> a rationale and strategy for
precursor flights and the sample-return missions.
<p>
   A fairly conservative strategy, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCleese</ENAMEX> said, would be to
launch a sample-return flight in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX> as the first of at least
three such missions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="2011">through 2011</TIMEX>. This would permit sampling visits
to a variety of Martian landscapes, from the ancient highlands
(where the meteorite may have originated) to basins where water
once flowed or regions suspected of holding subsurface reservoirs
of water.
<p>
   If the decision is to launch a sample-return flight in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> alone or with international partners would need to
use the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> opportunity to place one or two rovers on the surface,
to scoot about gathering rocks in caches for retrieval by the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>
sample-return mission.
<p>
   A more aggressive strategy might open with two missions in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>
and multiple flights at each subsequent opportunity for a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decade</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCleese</ENAMEX> said, or at least send two rovers to collect rocks at
widely diverse sites at each opportunity. The rover that picked up
the most intriguing samples would be paid the visit by the next
return craft. And if one rover should fail, another would be left
to prospect the surface.
<p>
   Although an aggressive approach might be more stimulating,
promising swifter results in the quest for possible Martian life,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> officials and many scientists are not sure how much it would
cost. But they suspect it would be more than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> would sit still for. They are also troubled by the shadow
of the two Viking spacecraft that went to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX> with
elaborate biology experiments, at a cost of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2.5 billion</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>
dollars, and failed to find unambiguous signs of life.
<p>
   ``We must be careful of walking into the Viking trap,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCleese</ENAMEX>
mused. ``That mission cost a lot, expectations ran high and
everybody was let down by its failure to find definite signs of
life. It led to the shutting down of our <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mars</ENAMEX> program for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years</TIMEX>.
If we try to go too fast now and promise too much, we could repeat
the Viking experience.''

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  A missile spotted by the pilot of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American
Airlines</ENAMEX> 757 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late last month</TIMEX> was flying in its authorized area and
did not pose a threat to the plane, a preliminary investigation by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> has found.
<p>
   The missile was one of two dozen launched annually from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>
test site on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wallops Island</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Va.</ENAMEX>, safety board spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter
Goelz</ENAMEX> said, and notice of the launching had been given. The
distance between the missile and the plane was greater than
requirements, he said.
<p>
   The report of the missile drew attention because of the crash of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> Flight 800 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two months ago</TIMEX> and subsequent speculation that it
was shot down by a missile. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goelz</ENAMEX> said that the pilot's seeing
it on his <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Juan</ENAMEX>-to-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX> flight ``doesn't indicate anything
other than that the pilot was alert.''
